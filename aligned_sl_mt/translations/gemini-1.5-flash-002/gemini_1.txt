O, sons, since I have completed for you this book, which is the culmination of the science of medicine, by its completion, its consequences, and its explanations, it seems to me that I should fulfill my duty to you with this treatise, which is a part of manual operation, that is, surgery.
Because manual operation is almost completely lost in our region and in our time, to the point that its science is in great peril, and its practice is obscured; and there remain of it only some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which are mostly corrupted and lead to errors and hesitation, so that their intentions are unclear and their power and art are weakened.
And it seems to me that I should revive it with the ordering of this treatise, according to the way of exposition, explanation, and abbreviation; and so that it may come with the forms of the cautery instruments and the other instruments of the work, as it should be by the addition of explanation, and by its preparation, which is a necessary cause.
But the reason why a skilled artisan is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and that its practitioner must first be exercised in the science of anatomy, which Gualia has recognized, so that he knows the arrangement of the members and their forms, and their connection and separation; and he must have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and ligaments, and their number, and their arrangement; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their emergence.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that with one name much is said, but little in the work, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already said this at the beginning of this book; for whoever is not learned in what we have said about anatomy is not exempt from falling into error, by which men will be killed, just as I have seen many of them, because some are trained in this science and undertake it without knowledge and experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced physician incise a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he incised some arteries of the neck, so that much blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who undertook to remove a stone from a man who had reached old age, and the stone was large, and he came to him and extracted that stone along with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and a black eunuch came to him who had a fracture in his thigh; and the physician, through his ignorance, extracted the fracture, over the wound, with cushions and splints with strong compression, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he unbound it according to his wishes, and then he bound it again, and then he left it like that for some days and ordered that we not unbind the bandage; and it remained so until the thigh and foot became abscessed, and it resulted in loss (of the limb/life).
And I was called to him, and I prepared to unbind the bandage, and calmness was achieved, and thus a lessening of his pains.
But however, corruption was already confirmed in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated after some days, until its malignancy was magnified by its master (i.e., the disease worsened under his care).
The reason is that the hot cancer is pure melancholic humor, therefore it is not fitting that it be treated with iron at all, but rather it should be in a limb which suffers so that it may be entirely contained (or stopped).
And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation with the hand be divided into two parts: that is, into an operation which is associated with health, and into a work with which there is peril in the greatest dispositions (or circumstances).
And I have already explained this in every part of this book where operations occur which involve error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to observe this and leave that, so that fools find no way to speak and to dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your instruments with diligence and with God's protection, and treat your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best method, by the grace of God, leading to health and praiseworthy success, and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult healing, and keep your instruments from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation in your faith and in your name may not overcome you: for it is more enduring to your glory, and higher in the world and behind your holiness.
Galen already said in some of his admonitions: Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad physician".
And I have divided this book according to three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter deals with the head down to the feet, the forms of instruments and the iron cauteries, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of incisions and perforations, and of cupping glasses, and of wounds, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, of restoration and dislocation, and of the treatment of sprains and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and of the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary that I say the quality of the benefits of that cautery and its harms, and in what constitution cautery is prohibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and its harm is a long and prolix discourse, and subtle in science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they disagree about it, and a little of their discourses suffices for me, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all complexions universally, which are with matter or without matter, except two complexions, which are hot complexions without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is helpful for that, and others say the contrary, that cautery is not convenient in an illness which is by quality and by dryness, because the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a hot and dry illness should be healed with that which is hot and dry.
And I contradict those who say the contrary, that benefit is done by cautery in every hot and dry illness that comes to the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say, concerning the discourse of that, that experience has revealed this to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that this should come to someone who is already experienced and skilled in the chapter on cautery through prior practice, and who has known the diversity of the complexions of men and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and the causes of those, and their accidents, and the span of time of those.
But in other complexions, there is no fear for you, and especially in cold and humid illnesses, because all physicians are agreed on those, and are not disagreed on the benefit with cautery in those.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and of its goodness, is superior to cautery with burning medicine, because fire is simple, the action of which does not reach except the member which is cauterized and does not harm the other member next to it except with little harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches to those members which are distant from it, and quickly brings to the member an illness of difficult healing and quickly kills.
But fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, except to surpass it. And it is known to us through experiment and through long service of study with the art on the truth of the causes; and for that I am excused from the length of speech. And if it were not that it is not written in my book in this place, a secret hidden from you with fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies, and its expulsion by which it expels illnesses, with philosophical demonstrative speech, which would be acute in your thoughts.
And know, sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is convenient to perform cautery, and they place the best time in springtime.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, because the harm due to accidental time is submerged in the benefit of that which is obtained with cautery, and especially if the cautery is for pains, or necessary, strong and urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay, because it is feared that from those a malignancy will come, which is greater than the small harm entering through time.
And this does not enter your thoughts, O sons, this is only esteemed by the vulgar people and foolish doctors, that is, that to that illness which is healed by cautery, there is no remission at all times, and they posit that consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they think for that reason, for cautery is only in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
However, cautery surpasses medicine in the speed of its effectiveness and virtue of its operation and greatness of its power.
And it is possible that his illness will return at some time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his illness, and his strength, and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him, and that which has come to him in his acquisition of food and similar causes; unless the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a member with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth for pain and similar to that, it is possible that that pain will not return to him, but this happens in small things.
And a more common saying is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and it is a true saying, not in the way they understand it, for they believe that it is a cure that does not benefit with medicine or with any other thing besides cautery.
And the reason is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is only when we administer methods of cure in certain illnesses, and those medicines are not effective, and then at the end of the process, one administers cautery, and it is beneficial for that. And therefore, from this it is understood that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and most foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the cauterized area does not scar, although this is not entirely true, for I have already tested this and found that it does not do so except in some bodies and not others, and cautery with gold is good and better than with iron as they said; however, when you cauterize with fire with gold, it is not clearly shown to you, for it is consumed according to the amount you desire due to the gold's softness, and because it readily absorbs heat; and if you apply too much heat to it, the gold melts from the fire, and some laminas fall into the fire so that the artisan is distracted by this.
And therefore, cautery with iron is done more easily and more appropriately for the correct operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered them from the head to the feet, so that I might readily give the petitioner what he desires.
The first chapter.
This cauterization counteracts the humidity and coldness on the brain, the accidents of which are of two causes: that is, the cause of excessive and copious rheumy flux, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and excessive sleep, and toothache and throat pain, and universally of every illness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, sudden stroke and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The form of this cauterization is this: firstly, order the patient to be evacuated with purgative medicine, purifying the head, for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, his age, and his constitution.
And then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then have him sit between your hands on a low bench and place his hands on his feet.
And then place the root of your palm near the hollow above the root of the nose between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that place, mark that spot with a pen, and then ignite the olive-shaped cautery, of which this is the form:
And then place that [cautery] on the spot marked with the pen, in such a way that it descends, with which your hand should be gradually tightened, and you should rotate it.
And then lift your hand lightly and observe the area, and if you see some quantity of the bone's head uncovered, like the amount of a grain of barley, then raise your hand, and if not, return your hand with that iron, or with another one if this one is cooled, until that which I have told you is seen of the bone.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the area and leave it for three days.
And then place on it cotton soaked in vinegar and leave it there until the fire scar is destroyed. And then treat the area with tetrafarmacon ointment until it is healed.
And it is said that the longer the wound remains open, the better it throws off the arm, because it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the fistula should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the bone's surface is hardened/burned.
And then scrape away what is burned from the bone, and then it should be treated/cured.
And others say that with the cautery, one should reach the bottom, until it firmly penetrates the bone, until the bone bleeds, and this is the form of a small abscess. And they believe that vapors from the head exhale from that place.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then it should be healed until it is consolidated (healed completely).
But I have not seen these two types of cautery at all, except in some men as a way of fear; and leave that, it seems to me, better is health, when it is; because the head is weakened by the solution of its continuity, as we have testified in other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a cold nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better, in my opinion; and I use that and work with that for health.
Chapter Two.
Concerning the cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs in the entire head, and this is prolonged in the patient, and he uses leeches and cupping and purgatives and plasters and potions and poultices and ointments and similar things, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery which we have recounted and none of these things benefit him, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and if it is not cold and finds great cold, then cauterize that with another cautery a little below that one. And then cauterize that above the horn of his head with a cautery until the scab is parted. Incise the scab and let the bone be uncovered to the extent that we have recounted, and cauterize that with a cautery in the rear part of the head in the place which is called the vas – and this is the place where a cupping glass is placed. And lighten your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient thereby finds much greater pain, different from the pain of all other cauteries of the head.
And I say this cautery in its place, for it is necessary that the cautery with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Chapter Three.
On the cauterization of recent (or new) migraine.
When a sudden, sharp pain occurs in the head, or a spreading pain within the eye, let the head be evacuated with purifying medicines, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have described in the descriptions of diseases; and if nothing helps, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and peel it and cut off its extremities from both ends. Then incise the location of the pain in the temple with a lancet, until a place is made under the skin, until it is hidden.
Then bind it tightly with a compress for continuous constriction, and leave it for the space of three hours; and then untie it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then place on it cotton soaked in boiling water until the area becomes inflamed.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner:  ignite the cautery, of which this is the form:
and it is called a nail or peg, because its head is like the shape of a clove, in which there is a certain curvature, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
And then place it on the location of the pain, and hold your hand — so that the burning, which is below, is not intensified — and move the iron little by little with speed.
And if the amount of it that is burned by the sharpness of the cautery is only half of it, and lift your hand so that the artery beneath is not burned, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place that on the area, and leave it for three days; and then apply cotton moistened with butter, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of a knife as with a cautery, and beware of cutting the artery in this particular, not-ancient, migraine.
Chapter four.
On the cauterization of chronic migraine.
When you treat a migraine with what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and sometimes because of the disease it is not enough to use what we said about the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire, then it is necessary that you heat the knife cautery until it is white-hot, after you mark the location of the pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or whatever; and place your hand for a moment and press it until you incise the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful of the continuation of the jaw, which is moved during mastication, and that the muscle not be injured and the nerve which serves it, and that spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the care and caution of the flow of blood from the artery that is incised, because in its incision there is danger, and especially for him who is ignorant of what he does and is not studious and experienced; and leaves the operation to him at the beginning.
And I will come with a reminder of the treatment of accidental blood flow from the artery according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if sometimes this disease is not relieved by this cautery and the patient's body is tolerable, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on the constriction of an artery with a cautery having two blades, and this cauterization is better and more suitable.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5: On the cauterization of earaches.
When pain in the ear occurs due to cold and is treated with laxative remedies and with the other treatments which I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, and this is the one called "puncta," of which this is the form:
And then apply the puncture, then the cauterization, and let it be carried around the entire ear as a wheel is revolved, or in the circumference of each part if the pain is localized. Lengthen the cautery from the root of the ear little by little after you have marked the place with a probe.
And if the cautery makes ten punctures in the whole ear, or whichever ear it may be, then treat the areas until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
On the cauterization of a cough.
A cough which is cured with cauterization is only one of the types which arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type of cough that originates from dryness or from a spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of cough with leeches and purgatives and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side from the affected area, because softening [of the humors, or healing] only occurs on the side that appears healthy.
And the manner of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery at the very tip of the upper ear, a little above the temple, and at the temple another, the length of which should be according to the length of the finger, and hold your hand with the cautery until the amount of half the thickness of the fingernail is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife, the form of which is shown previously [in a diagram, illustration, or earlier in the text]. However, it is more subtle to do it a little like this; and it is necessary to cut away some superfluous thickness.
And then care for the area with what was previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication is ineffective, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize it with four cauteries:  on all the corners of his head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as described above.
And it is now cauterized above the mouth of the stomach; and it is better afterwards; and then let it be cured with what follows.
Chapter VIII.
Concerning the cauterization of forgetfulness (amnesia) done by flame.
So that large enemas and purifying pills are given to the patient at the beginning.
And then shave the entire head of the patient and apply to their neck a plaster of cetre [a type of plaster/ointment] described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply that several times, for that is a manner of cauterization. And do this according to the same order which I have already said.
And therefore if he is healed by those means, it is good; and if not, then make for him three cauterizations in the back part of his head, which descend from the highest part of the head down to the lowest part of the neck. And place between each cauterization the width of a finger, and then treat the cauterization with what has been prescribed.
But if you see more inflammation and the patient is able to tolerate it, then cauterize him in the middle area; and if you see even greater inflammation, then cauterize above the two temples.
Then treat that until it is healed; and let the cauterization be olive-shaped according to the form given before.
Chapter 9.
On the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
So that you proceed in the purification of the head with leeches and with what we have said; and then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on all the temples of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body to find that and the patients are suffering and the illness is severe, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery until it is burned from the tail bone, and lift your hand. And then care for it until it is healed, and this should be an olive cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
And therefore it is necessary that you purify his brain at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatment which we have described in the section when the patient is strong and tolerates the purging of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and masticatories that purify the brain, before that for many days, with improvement of the diet.
Then shave the head of the patient, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery on the occiput, and cauterize above each temple. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I have mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, as has been previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
On the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and a thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries which we have described in the treatment of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give him something to drink that cleanses his brain, according to what has been described previously in the division (of treatments).
Then shave the patient's head, and then make a properly-made poultice for him on a circle (of cloth), and then place that in the middle of the head.
And let the patient be seated upright, and be held on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and it is best to use old sheep's fat. And heat that over the fire to a moderate temperature, which the said sufferer can bear when it is applied to him. Then pour that into the middle of his head within the circle, and leave it there until it is cold.
And do this to the patient once a week, along with his other treatment, until he is healed; or, if you wish, cauterize it by making small punctures according to his need,  but hold your hand with a cautery thus prepared: this is a type of cautery which moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply a cotton ball soaked in butter or goose grease.
Chapter 12.
On the cauterization of water descending into the eye.
When the beginning of watery discharge in the eye is apparent to you, through the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to purify his head, and protect him from all humidities.
And make him sweat in a bath for several days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on the two temples if the onset of the watery discharge is in both eyes, or on one side if the onset of the water is in one eye.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are below the occiput; and let the cauteries be far apart in the width of the temples.
And beware of excessive bleeding when it is cauterized; and if you see excessive bleeding, stop it with any medicine that is available to you.
And I come with wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and caution against excessive bleeding.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below the two bones with two cauteries, separately applied.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old tears (likely referring to fistulas or chronic sores near the eyes).
When the tears from the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest location of the head and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that with the cautery which we have recounted in the initial chapter concerning water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two bones. And if it requires additional treatment, then cauterize it at the corner of the eye, above the end of the eyebrow, with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal odor (or a bad smell from the nose).
When you treat this with what we have said in the division and your treatment is ineffective, then prepare and give the patient potions to drink for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize it with a moderate-sized olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize it with a clove-shaped cautery, with two cauterizations above the two eyebrows, slightly below the hair.
And beware of burning too deeply so that you do not damage the underlying tissue.
And this is the shape of the clove-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the cauterization for the softening of the eyelids.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize, do so above the two eyebrows a little, with two cauteries on each side, and let them be elongated towards the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand and the cautery, but only to the extent that a third part of the eyelid is hardened/cauterized.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are turned inwards and prick the eye.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inwards so that they prick the eye, cauterization in those cases is done in two ways, for cauterization is either done with fire or with a burning medicine.
If you cauterize with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to shave their eyelashes like those who clean them, until they are lengthened and equalized; and if it pricks near their roots, then you should bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so that they are not injured until the hairs have grown back.
Then, when they have grown back and are equalized, place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on the eyelid of their eyes with a probe, with a mark which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
And then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or in mallow mucilage on the eye.
And then heat the cautery, of which this is the form.
And then cauterize over the mark that you have made, little by little, in several times, until the surface of the eyelid, which is like a myrtle leaf, is completely burned.
And a sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid already contracted and the hairs raised above the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with ointment on it until the scar is healed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if something returns through the hairs near their origin and the eyelid is softened, then apply the cautery again in the same way as you did initially.
But if the hairs are below the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
But cauterize with a burning medicine; that is, order the patient to pull the hairs until they are elongated and even, and then make a myrtle leaf-shaped dressing from a piece of cloth.
Then take known soap and quicklime, about an ounce, or whatever, and mix these ingredients well, and do this quickly so that it does not get cold; then spread this on the cloth that is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place this over one or both eyes; and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head should be in your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it lightly, but not too much, until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, because the bite is like fire.
And so, when you perceive that he feels the bite, then remove the medicine and wipe it with your finger; then, when the bite ceases, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then observe if you see that the eyelid is now raised; if it is not raised, cauterize it with fire or with an incision, because then it is well; and if not, return some of the medicine to the place where the medicine did not reach and it does not blacken until your work is even and the eyelid is contracted.
Then place cotton with a bandage over it until the scab from the cauterization is removed, and then treat it with healing ointment or other until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, during your operation, to watch with vigilant diligence that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid after some days is softened and some of the hair roots are in the eye, then repeat your medicine on that place which of the eyelid is softened, and properly as you did in the beginning, and then bandage it until it is healed.
And this is the method for myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified according to their size and smallness, and therefore according to that is your contraction made.
And the way of rectitude shall not be hidden from him who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula that is in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and your treatment does not succeed, then you must cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place his head on your lap, and let a minister hold his head between your hands in such a way that his head is not moved or agitated.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or gum arabic on his eye.
Then heat the cautery, whose shape is as follows:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's feather, at the end with which the cauterization is performed.
And if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other end. And if you want, let it be shaped like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
Then place the cautery, which should be well ignited, over it; and hold your hand a little below the cautery, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not burn or the patient is disturbed; and then place the cautery on the granulation of the eye and cauterize it.
And so, if at the beginning your cautery penetrates to the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then place a dressing over it with lint and surround it with drying ointment until it is healed.
But if eleven days have passed and it is not healed, then place a sharp corrosive medicine over it until the bone is uncovered and scraped as is appropriate in its chapter.
And another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some ancients described:  approach the location of the fistula and open it, and then place in that fissure a thin tube whose shape is like this:  And pour into it the quantity of one ounce of molten lead; and hold your hand with a cloth with a good grip, and do not hurt the patient so that the molten lead does not reach his eye; and you should place over the patient's eye a cloth soaked in egg white or water, because the lead will cauterize the location of the fistula and heal it by a marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said of the cautery and the treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal puncture and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose as it will come to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
On the cauterization of the fissure of the wells (or, possibly,  "On cauterizing the cleft of the [body part -  the exact meaning of 'potz' is unclear without more context]").
Many times fissures occur on the lips, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the sections and your treatment does not work, then ignite a small, knife-like cautery according to this form that is shown:
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then carefully place that [cautery] in those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat that with cerates until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops and then breaks, and then becomes chronic, and pus flows and a fistula is formed, and then you treat it and the treatment is not effective, then you should apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula.  Then place that heated cautery in the opening of the fistula, and hold it there until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and then do this once or twice. And then treat it with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
And so if the wound is incised and heals, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone according to what will be described in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the cauterization of teeth and the softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by humidity and the teeth are decayed, and you treat them with medicines and they are not effective, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be described later, in such a way that you place the small tool (likely a small instrument to hold the cautery near the tooth) over the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, and hold it for a short time until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as needed.
And then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the decayed tooth is sealed, the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt humidity is dried out.
Chapter 21.
On the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or a worm in it, and you do not achieve a cure with medicine, then cauterize it in one of two ways: either cauterize with a cow's horn or cauterize with fire.
Cauterization with a horn involves taking a cow's horn and boiling it in a cauldron of iron. Then take a cotton swab and wrap it around the end of a stick, then dip it in the boiling horn, and quickly apply it to the aching tooth until it cools.
And then repeat this several times until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool or cotton in the aforementioned horn, and place that on the aching tooth, and place ignited iron on top of it until the iron reaches the bottom of the tooth cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is that you use a small tube of bronze or iron, and there should be some thickness in its body, and the sharpness of the fire should not reach the patient's mouth.
Then ignite the cautery, the form of which will be apparent, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand there until the cautery cools; and do this several times because the pain will be reduced either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, by the application of that cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good wine and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cautery.
And cauterize with whichever extremity you wish, as is possible for you.
And this is the shape of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
On the cauterization of extrophuli (or possibly, external swellings/bumps).
When extrophuli are caused by phlegm and cold humors and are not responsive to medicinal digestion, and you wish to digest them lightly, then ignite the concave cautery, the shape of which is as follows [description presumably to follow], having two open ends so that the smoke escapes through one end of the cautery, and place this ignited instrument over the abscess once, or more times if needed, until it reaches the base of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and apply a cotton pad soaked in a poultice until what the fire has burned is healed.
And then treat it with ointment and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the cauterization of hoarseness and constriction of the throat.
When humidity affects the lung's canal, and especially when this is accompanied by cold constitution, then the patient should be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and then cauterize that area below the root of the throat in the depressed location.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor burn the uvula, only a little.
And cauterize that area with another cautery below the joint of the neck, at the last vertebra. And his cautery should be a small nail, following the previous method.
And then treat that with what has been previously prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold and damp humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the illness is chronic, then cauterize with two cauteries on the clavicle in the previously mentioned locations, on the left and right; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a small nail according to the previous method.
And if you wish, your cauterization may be punctate with the cautery that is called a punctate cautery, the form of which precedes in the punctation of earache.
And let there be points within those [cauterizations]; and then treat it with the same things as preceded until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs, for cauterization is done with this: with one application you can make three cauteries according to this method:
Chapter 25.
Of the cauterization of the testicle, which is the head of the penis.  *(Note:  The translation is interpretive.  "Ajutori" likely refers to the penis, but its exact meaning is uncertain and could also refer to something related to the urinary system.)*
When the head of the penis is dislocated because of lubricating humors and is not fixed in the moment of its return from its dislocation until it is accustomed to returning, and then by a small movement it is dislocated again as it has happened, as we have witnessed, then first you must reduce the dislocation; and then the patient should be turned on his back or on his healthy side; and then raise the scrotum which is in the inner part of the testicle towards the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated in the inner parts.
And then heat the cautery which has two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the scrotum until it penetrates from one side to the other; and the figure of the cauterization will then be of four cauterized heads.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place over the cautery cooked figs with salt, and then keep the patient calm, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a nail-shaped cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened and the humidity is removed, and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Concerning the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and many humors enter the stomach, exceeding its capacity and multiplying within it, and if you continue the treatments and do not cure it, then the patient should lie supine, extending their hands and legs.  Then cauterize it with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, to the extent of one finger, using a nail-shaped cautery; and two cauteries below on either side of the first cautery, so that a triangular figure of cautery is formed; and space them so that they are not touching, which would cause decay.
And if the depth of the cautery [is] the amount of two-thirds of the thickness of the finger.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery in the form of a circle according to this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized, paying attention to that which is feared from this cautery:  and it is that you mark on the stomach points according to the amount you wish with a probe, and then cauterize those points with a cautery; and then treat it with the treatment that is prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On the cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain occurs in the liver due to coldness, or humidity, or excessive flatulence, so that it is expelled from its normal composition by superfluous egress, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it does not help, then the patient should be supine on his back, and mark with a probe three cauteries according to this form and this same quantity on the liver under the hypochondria, where the decubitus of a man is perceived.
And let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight finger.
And do not press too much with the cautery.
And if the quantity of what is burned is the amount of half the thickness of a finger, and no more; and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him lie down, having already spread his legs, and raise his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these areas with a knife-like cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the thickness of a whole finger be burned so that the whole body is burned and reaches the intestines, because the finger is subtle here; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the perforation of an abscess of the liver with a cautery.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the liver and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient finds gravity and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the tunic of the liver, the pain is very sharp, and sometimes it even tires the doctors in its treatment.
Therefore, the patient should be turned onto their side; and then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then ignite the cautery, which is shaped like a rake, the form of which was shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until the whole abscess is consumed, until it reaches the bottom, until pus comes out.
And then treat it with the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that this type of cautery be used except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and in whose hands many diseases have been known; however, someone with some experience may dare to perform this operation, but nonetheless, leave it to us, it is better.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that a cautery made from the roots of birthwort is effective for cold pleurisy in this manner: that you take a long, dry root of birthwort, one finger in length, and of the thickness of a finger.
Then dip it in oil and hold it to the fire, and cauterize with a cautery in the place which is between the continuation of the clavicle and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the clavicle, slightly leaning towards the part below the beard, and with two cauteries in that which leans between the fifth rib and the sixth, leaning slightly towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and with another on the stomach; and with three cauteries on the back; and with one cautery in the place which is between the two shoulders; and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulders.
And you should not grasp the cautery with your hand, but let it be held by a suitable instrument.
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron similar to a ray and heat it, and apply it to the place which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess and it is thoroughly cauterized, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But this perforation with a cautery is not without danger, for one may easily cause a fistula there, which is not easily healed.
Chapter 30.
Concerning the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen with what we have said of the treatment in the division and your treatment is not effective, then cauterize it in three ways, all of which are appropriate. One is to make three or four cauterizations along the length of the spleen, according to the length of the spleen, following the shape of the liver cauterizations, the form of which has been previously described.
And let the distance between each cauterization be the width of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as that which we described for the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and the patient should be lying on their side.
And another way to cauterize is to ignite the cautery having two points, which we described in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the rib which is in the area of the spleen where the patient's left side lies.
And your elevation, with which you raise the rib, should be according to the length of the body, so that cauterizations are made according to the width of the body.
And then insert the two points, very hot, into that space so that with them you penetrate the rib from the other side.
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus four cauterizations are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three points.
And then you treat the cauterization once it has stopped discharging pus for many days, for this is more important than the other preceding things in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the cauterization of a dropsical person.
Cauterization is not applied in dropsy, but only in a swelling, properly speaking.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize them with four cauteries in a circle around the navel, and with one cautery over the stomach, and with another cautery over the liver, and with another cautery over the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and with another cautery over the stomach. And the depth of the cauterization should be proportional to the thickness of the skin.
And then leave the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the treatment from the patient near the cauterization with what is necessary, so that two intentions are added to it, and healing is hastened with help.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its shape is described above, and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, as its shape is described previously.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed in dropsy and filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, in the area between the little finger and ring finger.  Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand again and do not completely withdraw it, because the yellow water will flow out.
The cautery should be of this shape:  Then make two cauteries on both thighs, and on each thigh a cautery should be made with the knife-like end of the cautery. And let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other in the middle of the thigh; and two cauteries on each thigh.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some water may drain from it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
On the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is afflicted by cold and humidity to the point that it weakens the vital functions—that is, the digestive and retentive powers which are in the stomach and intestines—and this is treated with methods of care and fails to improve, and sometimes the patient suffers from cauterization exhibiting virtue, then cauterize that area with a large cautery on their stomach, as was previously described in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and with four small cauteries in a circle around the navel, using a slender, pointed cautery; and with a cautery on the flank above the hip, either a large one or two smaller cauteries.
And if sometimes the humors are excessive and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize that area over the pubic bone and over the intestines, and quickly apply two cauteries near the stomach and near the groins, for this is a perfect cure and a help from which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
On the cauterization of chronic hemorrhoids.
When there are in their nature chronic hemorrhoids, or ones caused by thick, cold humors or corrupted moistures, and they are treated with what we have said in the division and do not improve, then cauterize with three cauteries on the most prominent part of the coccyx, small and slightly triangular, and with a cautery above the navel, close to two fingers' breadth from it.
And if you suspect that the patient's stomach is chilled and their food is not digested, and their face is sometimes inflamed, then cauterize the stomach with a large cautery as previously described; and with one cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on their spleen with a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat them until they are healed.
Chapter 35.
On the cauterization of swellings near their excision.
When you excise a swelling, then ignite the cautery that resembles a ray (or, a spoke/rod). Then insert that ignited cautery into the excised swelling, and apply your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do this once or twice, for if the swellings are many, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and then treat those with ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on someone, it is more slow in healing.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. Of the cauterization of fistulas that are formed in the lower parts of the body.
When nature does not obey the treatment which we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by this, let it be healed with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the lower parts, and it is old, running with pus and corrupted humors, then that which is most worthy to be done is to probe it with a thin probe, and then know the quantity and depth of it with the aforementioned probe.
Then ignite the cautery which is similar to a ray [or, perhaps, a "rod"]. And then place that ignited cautery into the fistula, according to the extent to which the probe entered.
And iterate upon that the cautery until those corrupted bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, according to the amount of your necessity.
And beware of burning the nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder or the body of the intestine, then beware of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it is not penetrating [deeper structures].
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the place is sealed, and the materials are excised from it, and remain so for a long time, then know that it is already completely cured.
And if the materials are not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in the depth of it something is corrupted, or this comes from those causes of which mention will be made in their place [later in the text].
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of wounds.
When in wounds pain arises from cold or excessive inflammation, and because of this the patient's strength is diminished, then it is necessary that you cauterize that upon the wounds with a cautery, upon each wound with a nail-shaped cautery, the preparation of which was mentioned previously.
And quickly cauterize again a little lower, so that three linear cauterizations will result, and then they will be more effective in helping.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that in the lowest part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side, and with another on the left.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the patient's walnut; and cauterize that with a cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a nail, as is customary/appropriate.
Chapter 39.
Concerning the cauterization of the breast.
When cold and humidity come to the breast, and because of this pregnancy is prevented, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then it is necessary that the place be cauterized with three cauteries in the area around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
Concerning the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
When mucous humors are poured into the area of the hip, and are the cause of its displacement, and a sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when they are compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it bulges.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the part of their hip with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the circumference of the affected area as it is swollen, so that the affected area falls within the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the type previously described for the cauterization of the stomach.
And if that cautery is not at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be made according to the extent of the thickness of the entire swelling; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the hip area, and it is caused by cold and dampness, the patient is treated with what we have said and does not improve, and this is longstanding, then you must purge the patient of thick humors with foul-smelling pills or with artificial or similar pills; and then cauterize it.
And the manner of cauterization in that case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Indeed, according to two known methods, of which one is that you cauterize that area on the patient's hip with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make them of good depth. And let the space which is between each cautery be the amount of the thickness of a finger, whether the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes let the cautery be in the middle of the place, on the head of the hip, so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose form precedes in the cauterization of hip dislocation, that is, let it be a continuous circle and burn the thickness of the whole buttock.
And this is the method of cauterization in sciatica when pain is adherent to the hip and is not extended into the thigh.
But if it is extended into the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, on the place to which the patient points as the location of the pain; and with one cautery on the kneecap, about four fingers below the left side.
And if the cautery is knife-shaped, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the buttock.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is extended to the area near the toes, then cauterize there where indicated with a cautery in three or four points, or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is below the buttock towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife-shaped cautery.
And be careful in all cauterization that you do not go so deep with the cautery that you burn nerves or large arteries, and that because of this you do not cause harm, unconsciousness, or convulsions to the patient.
And I have seen one and another of those whom I cauterized on the ankle and went too deep in the cauterization, and the leg swelled until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted. And then a strong case of diarrhea occurred, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each according to this method.
And some wise men say, in the cauterization of the ankle, use a cautery of which this is the method: make a circle of iron similar to this, of which the circumference should be half a palm; and let the opening be according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less.
And within that circle let there be another, a third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of a hazel nut; and let those circles be open on two sides; and let the length of those irons be a hazelnut or two, and make in those irons a mark decently prepared in the circles; and this is its form:
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then let it be placed on the part of the ankle, the patient lying on their side. And thus cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave it there for three days; then plaster it with a bandage and leave the wound open for many days; and then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
Says Albucasis: O, son, of this type of cautery we have used little, because of the fear of its appearance, and because few have been found who dared to look upon it.
But of the good cauteries to him who suffers them, and finds with that its location.
But cauterize with adherent medicines, such that you make two circles having perforated handles in which you insert the bolt of an iron door; let the length of the walls in height be two nuts or whatever those are.  (This line is difficult due to the ambiguity of "nozes" and the unusual description of the cautery tool).
And if the space which is between each is the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and they are open below and above, and they contain themselves between them according to this form:
Then place the patient's afflicted hip on the side, lying on their side, and press your hand on the area of the hip; then take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and heat it gradually with little fire, and keep it at that temperature for about an hour, and let the patient suffer the biting and burning— for it causes a burning sensation like fire— until the burning stops.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the warm water from the whole hip with fresh water.
Then leave it for three days and apply a bandage until the blackness of the burn is softened, and leave it for a few days, and pus will drain from it; this is the final treatment.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the hip or leg, make for him a bath that contains water, done in the same manner as for the hip.
And this is the method for hot water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, equal parts of each, crush them and place them in a new pot, the bottom of which is perforated by a small hole, according to the amount that will enter the ray. (The "ray" likely refers to a specific instrument or body part; more context would be needed for precise translation.)
And place below the bottom of the pot another inverted pot, and pour over the alkali and quicklime live (unslaked) fresh water which covers them by a finger's width, and after you compress them with your hand with good pressure, let the sharp water descend from above into the inverted pot below.
And then collect all that water, and pour it over more fresh quicklime and alkali, for then it will be of very strong acidity, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterization of other members, because it acts like fire.
And some medicines with which one also cauterizes are:  thrice-boiled honey and quicklime with soap, mixed together.  (The "tezizic" is likely a corruption or a word not readily translatable without more context;  "thrice-boiled" is a speculative interpretation based on potential meaning in similar languages.)
And Gualia recounted the operation and cure of a man of old times, by which pain of the hip and sciatic vein was cured, and greatly praised the efficacy of it, and said that he needed no other cure, and that he was healed at once, just as he recounted, for he quickly entered a bath and was immediately free of it.
And it is that fresh rue should be taken, and if fresh rue is not found, a fresh fig should be taken; and it should be well crushed with a little fat and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and bound on.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels a lessening of the burning.
Then put him in a bath, and when his body is reddened, expose him to the sun, for the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
But Dioscorides said that when the varicose vein is cauterized with a goat's horn, it profits him much; and the cautery should be applied in this manner: wool should be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the toes and between the ankle bones.
Then take a dry goat's horn and heat it in the fire until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is extinguished. Then repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of the cauterization reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this manner of cautery is called cautery of the veins.
Chapter 42.
Of the cauterization of toothache.
Sometimes pain is in the teeth from various causes, such as a fall or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and from causes similar to those, by the infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cautery is only suitable for that single type which is caused by the effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuation of the patient with purgative pills and similar remedies,  make incisions on the tooth where the pain is, three lines according to its width; then mark with a tenaculum in each line five cauterizations or more, according to the amount tolerated by the patient and their strength.
And let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a nail-shaped cautery according to this method:
Chapter 43.
Concerning cauterization at the beginning of gibbosity (or humpback).
Many times this illness happens to small children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it occurs on their spine with elevation and movement.
And you find in the last vertebra of the back and neck that it already begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that with a cautery that is circular according to this form: so that the cautery takes in the whole part of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with the pointed cautery two or three lines. And let the points be close to each other.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered in swelling that is caused by a spasm of the nerves.
Chapter 44.
Concerning the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pains are caused by cold humors which are infused into each member of the body, then when pain comes in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call this gout properly.
And therefore, if gout caused by cold is cured with a method of cure and the pains are not lessened, then cautery lessens them.
And it is so that you cauterize that area for evacuation in the circumference of the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary that a puncture be made on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise into the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize that area on each knee with three or four cauteries on each side with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize that area and do not press your hand too hard with the cautery beforehand; let it only be around the thickness of a finger.
And if the pains rise into both knees, then apply the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands and it is called  rheumatism, then puncture in the circumference of the wrists as they turn, puncturing those two lines.
And if the pain remains in the fingers, then puncture in the circumference of the wrists on each night and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pains rise in some days to the hips or muscles, then cauterize them on all sides of the affected areas.
And do not neglect the patient's good regimen and reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of fractures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestines protrude before the scrotum, and this is beginning to happen, then it is necessary that you order the patient to cease eating on that day and that he use lenient remedies so that the rupture descends from his belly.
Then hold the patient between your hands over his back, and order him to hold his breath until the hernia or intestine is expelled or appears.
And then return that with your fingers and gently push the rupture over the pubic bone, noting that its extremity should resemble a half-circle in the upper parts of the body.
And then heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out.
And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion underneath; and another servant should be on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and hold it there until you reach with it the bone of the hip joint in the middle of the buttock; and repeat this another time if you did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And observe wisely the protrusion of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn that intestine, lest death or other great harm befall the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not complete/successful.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be subtle, according to their size and measure.
And then care for the cauterized area for three days with a bandage until the burn scar is healed.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the area and wound are sealed/healed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment according to the length of his treatment, which will cleanse his belly, and that the intestine does not come out due to the exertion of healing.
And then, when he wants to get up after about forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days.
And let him be lessened in work and the repletion of food and drink, and of vehement voices, for when he uses this entire regimen of healing he will be completely healed.
And I will say the treatment of ruptures in the other parts of the belly; and so, at the beginning, and if you want them not to spread, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let that which is excised from the hernia be like a third part of it; and then treat it with what we have said, and it is well-suited.
And some first said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form, since it is marked with a probe:
and a line is placed which is across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a nail cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of torsion (or twisting/strangulation).
When in some member, because of a fall or a blow, pain arises and that pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be for each member according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the torsion and its pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cauterization, good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization; for it is customary for these pains to be punctured from one member to the neighboring member, wherefore it is necessary that you treat those with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes treated with cautery with great benefit, and especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
Therefore, if you wish to cauterize a leper, consider whether the leprosy is spreading, and if you have treated it with what we have said in the division and it does not cease or remain, and you fear that the corruption may affect the entire body and complexion of the patient, then cauterize the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second below it, between the forehead and the hairline; and two on both temples; and one behind, on the nape of the neck.
And finally, with the cautery, press gently so that a small impression is made on the bone, and the scabs are removed, so that the exhalation of thick vapors is relieved; and cauterize over the spleen as needed.
And if the leprosy is already widespread on the patient and manifestly apparent, then you should cauterize with the cauteries we mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the vertebrae near the coccyx, and one on the coccyx, and with two on the hips, and one on each buttock, and with two on the knees, and one on each knee, and with two on the ankles, and with two on the calves, and one on each calf, and with two on the heels, and with two on the muscles, and with two on the knuckles of his feet; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers of the hands and feet, and on each heel of his feet, and on the knuckles of his hands.
And be careful of the nerves which are on the heel, that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pubic bone, and another on the stomach opening, and another on the liver.
And know that the more accurately you apply cauteries, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as they do from wounds, because his body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as is prescribed by the types of instruments.
Then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour mixed with honey and with other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On cauterization of numbness/stupor.
When a limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. And afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes some numbness which extends to the hands and feet, and to the vertebrae of the back, is cauterized near the exit of the nerves which move that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
But do not attempt this except one who is learned in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves moving the whole body.
Chapter 49.
On the cauterization of albaras, which is morphea.  (Note:  "Albaras" and its connection to "morphea" needs further research to give a completely accurate translation.  Morphea is a type of scleroderma.  Albaras may be a medieval term for a similar skin condition.)
When albaras is old and you do not apply any medicinal ointments to it, then cauterize it with a hot cautery iron a little, according to the size and nature of the affected area, until the whiteness and its color are relieved, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of barley and lentils, with rose oil, and with arnagrosa leaves, and with pigeon's blood or raven's blood, each in equal parts, all mixed together; then apply a linen cloth over the area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
On the cauterization of cancer. (Note:  "Cranc" here almost certainly refers to cancerous sores or tumors, not the crustacean.)
When a cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around its perimeter as it is swollen.
And the wise men say that it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery iron in the middle; but to me this is not advisable, for I fear that it will be ulcerated, and I have seen this happen on several occasions.
And it is more advisable that it be cauterized around its perimeter with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries. (The meaning of "motz cauteris" is likely "multiple cauterizations" or "many small cauterizations.")
Chapter 50.  (Assuming a Roman numeral system is being used.  The dot could indicate a break in the numbering system used in the manuscript.)
Concerning the cauterization of a boil (or abscess).  ("Adubilati" seems to refer to a type of swelling or inflammation, likely a boil or abscess.)
When a boil is delayed in maturation, and this is due to the superfluity causing it, or due to the patient's age, because they are old and decrepit, of little blood, or because of the time of year, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the boil; then cauterize around its perimeter with many small, pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten its maturation.
But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the boil until it penetrates the skin. ( "Codena" likely means skin or the outer layer)
And if the cautery is in that place which is lower down, so that the body of the arm may be relieved; and then care for it until it is healed. (This implies a boil is located on the arm).
Chapter 52.
Concerning the cauterization of a corrosive (or, a corrosive cauterization).
A corrosive is a corruption moving in the limb, which corrodes it like fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosive in a place which can tolerate cauterization with fire, then you should ignite very small, and large, cautery nails, according to what is appropriate for the place where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it completely until you eradicate all the corrosion and none of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply crushed sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until the scabs are completely removed and all the corruption is gone.
And then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh has grown where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on what remains in the corrupted areas.
And a corroding ulcer is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine, for that serves in place of cauterization. However, cauterization with fire is of more certain help.
And I have already described its treatment with sharp medicine in the section, and therefore take that when you have need of it.
Chapter 53.
On the cauterization of wounds and other similar things.
Many times a disease called a wound happens in the parts below the foot, and it is a large, deep wound that hurts the foot; and cauterization in these cases is done in two ways, that is, cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is to ignite a concave cautery, similar to a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size needed to encompass the entire wound, and it should be of fine edges.
Then place that ignited instrument over the wound, and move your hand with the cautery in a circle around the wound until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. And leave it there for three days until it begins to shed pus. Then plaster it with crushed wild mallow mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it is not healed, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should apply cautery with water to those areas.  Take a cannula of bronze or iron or a vulture's quill, and place it over the wound; then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand, and completely move it with the pressure of your hand; and let the edge of the cannula be pressed into the root of the wound, and the hot water will find its way to the root of the wound; and let the patient endure the bite of the hot water for a little while, about an hour, and then remove it, for the wound with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this to those [wounds] and then to the others, until you have treated all those that are in the body.
Then treat those sores, once the roots of the wounds are eradicated, with ointments that generate flesh.
Chapter 54.
On the cauterization of tremor.
When someone suffers from tremor due to cold in the nerves, or from a cold-caused fever, or from a similar cause, then you should cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra with one cautery; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, with an olive-shaped cautery.
And their tremor will cease, and hasten the healing of the cold illness.
Chapter 55.
On the cauterization of accidental ailments of the body.
When in the body there are boils and pustules which are formed from thick, corrupted matter; then, at the beginning of their appearance, it is necessary that they be cauterized at the head of the fistula with a fine cautery with myrtle wood, the tip of which is heated with fire; or with long roots of  *erestologia* (a plant whose name may not be accurately translated); or with a lenticular (lens-shaped) cautery.
And sometimes a cautery is also suitable at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner; and they are not believed (to be serious), and the superfluity is broken up by making these (cauterizations), and heals from them.
However, it is necessary that this (cauterization) be done near an evacuation with phlebotomy (bloodletting).
Chapter 56.
Chapter 56.  On the cauterization of accidental bleeding from a wound caused by an arrow.
Very often, bleeding occurs from an arrow wound that is incised below the wound, which comes from outside, or from the incision of abscesses or cauterization of a limb, and similarly, and it is difficult to stop that (bleeding).
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you press with your hand on the opening of the arrow wound, and place your thumb over it, pressing it many times until the bleeding stops under your thumb, and it does not come out.
Then put small and large olive cauteries in the fire, many in number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then take one of those, small or large depending on the location and wound where the artery is broken, on that vein quickly, after you have removed your thumb, and hold the cautery there until that blood is stopped and constrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your thumb and apply the cautery, then take another cautery carefully from those that are prepared in the fire, and then do not cease doing this one after another until the blood is constrained.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that another harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to restrain the blood in those cases, and especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction when it is not extracted, for when it is extracted the extremities are better burned and the blood is restrained, or that it be tied with thread or with a strong ligature, or that medicines whose virtue is to restrain blood be applied, and they are tightened with a cushion with decent compression.
But that which administers decent restriction with ligature and with stricture with cloths or by the application of cauterizing agents and similar things, does not confer [its effect] except slowly.
But if this happens to someone and the physician or medicine is not present, then gently place the index finger over the opening of that vein as we have said, and apply great compression until the blood is stopped from the superior part of the wound, and the finger should not be removed from the artery; and over the artery let cold water of great coldness be sprinkled until the blood is congealed and thickened; and then consider what need there is of cautery or medicine.
Of incisions and perforations and cupping and of phlebotomy and of wounds and their similars.
We have already discussed in the first chapter every illness in which cautery with fire and with burning medicine is suitable, and its occasions and causes, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the top of the head to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the one who seeks this will be relieved, then concerning that which he will have asked.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that in this chapter is that which is in the first chapter on cauterization, but in a less terrifying manner. (or ...but to a lesser degree of terror).
And because it is necessary that there be great caution in this, for in the operations which are in this chapter, many times there happens an evacuation which is with blood, with which life is bound, through the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or purification of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision of a stone, and things like that. And all those are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in the worst case, death.
And I warn you that this should not befall you, in which there is hesitation, for sometimes it happens to you through the handling of men with many kinds of illnesses. And of them, there is someone who is angry with his illness and death is light to him, and this is because of the vehemence of what he finds in his illness, and because of the length of his illness, and with the illness is a fear which signifies death.
And of those there is one who gives you his possessions and says, you are hoping for his health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore, it is not fitting that you consent to him who comes to you who is of this manner; and your caution should be greater than covetousness and your greed; and do not presume anything about this except from certain knowledge which verifies this to you, and to which follows praiseworthy success.
And use in the cure of all your patients prognostication and indication of him to whom health is restored, for in that there is for you help in the acquisition of fame and memory, of praise and of glory.
O, sons, may God inspire in you His understanding and not obstruct for you direction and protection, for this is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that this which you ask for and of which you have need may be alleviated for you.
Chapter one.
Of the treatment of the water which is contained in the heads of infants.
Know that this illness often happens to infants during birth and when the midwife squeezes the infant's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it happens for a hidden reason which is not known.
But I have only seen this illness in infants; and in all those whom I saw, death followed, and thus it is a fatal affliction in them, in my experience.
And I have seen that an infant whose head was full of water, and his head was always thus enlarged until he could not support himself because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture is either collected between the scalp and the bone, or collected under the bone on the brain.
Because if the operation is necessary and the moisture is between the scalp and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure in width, and the length of the fissure should be about two nuts so that the moisture flows out, and this is the shape of the spatula:
And so if the moisture is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone, the sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress it with your hand on the inside parts and this is not hidden from you. You should make an incision in the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:
And then extract all the moisture from the incision; and then bind the fissures with cloths and lint; and then dress it with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then untie the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore aim with the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do it as best you can.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood, and the patient dies from that blood loss with evacuation of moisture.
Chapter second (or Chapter two).
When someone develops cataracts or rheum in the eyes or the feet, and this is longstanding, and medical treatments are ineffective, then the last resort is incision of those two arteries (temporal arteries).
And therefore, when you wish to incise them (the arteries), have the patient raise their head, and rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and the patient's neck should be constricted with a cloth; and observe where the vein pulses; and the location of each, above the locations which are near the ears, are compressed, and thus are hidden except in some men.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and incise each with a sharp lancet on each side, with the incision reaching to the bone, and this should be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and sever it at the incisions above.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers' breadth, because when a vein is incised, the blood flows out with a pulsatile flow, which spurts out with frequent leaps.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth, and mark it with a probe, and cut to the bone.
And the amount of blood to be let is about six ounces, and quickly remove more or less from him, and all this is according to the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
And then examine the wound, and if any part of the splinter remains on the bone, then incise it so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And then bind the wound with lint and linen bandages, and treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic migraine or sharp headaches, due to acrid humors and a quality of laceration in the temples, or [the pain] is old, vehement, and similar to these, and is treated with medical methods of cure and this does not help, then we should attempt in these illnesses the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or their cauterization as we have shown.
And the method of operation and extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hairs which are in the temples; and he should attend to the artery apparent in the temple, for it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden except in few men by the vehemence of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the neck of the patient should be constricted with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or evaporate the area with hot water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you scrape the skin with that [spatula] easily until you reach the artery; and then insert a hook there and extract it to the superior parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics which are beneath it, from every part.
But if the artery is subtle, then wrap it with the end of the hook, and then incise it a little according to the quantity by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and there will be no flow of blood, for if they are not incised the blood will not rise at all.
And then evacuate from one to three ounces of blood.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double linen thread or with cords at length, and do not allow it putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound and consequent flow of blood.
And then incise the superfluity which is between the two ligatures; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are incised, and it will be instead of that same procedure.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or is of a hot complexion; for cautery is one of those things that helps to dry humidities, and therefore it is better in its application.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that you fill the place with old linen, and that powders are applied on it decently, and then it should be treated with dry medicines to produce new flesh and with bandages until it is healed.
And if, while you operate another time, a flow of blood from the artery occurs, then you must take care to restrain that blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the place with linen, and squeezing your hand until the blood is restrained. And if none of those things is at your disposal, then place your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and bathe the place with very cold water until the acuteness subsides, and it is tightened as necessary.
And what is easiest in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and place each, very hot, until they reach the bone and sever the vein in two places, so that what is between the extremities is elongated, because they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. However, if it has less sharpness than two knives it is better, because if it is as sharp as two knives it will approach each side too quickly and will not cut the flesh evenly.
Therefore, since in those [instruments] there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is held in them and the flesh is cut more easily.
And this method is better in every way and gentler.
And let the space which is between the two blades be the amount of the thickness of a finger.
Chapter four.
Concerning the treatment of sharp and acrid eye discharges.
When there are acrid tears, and the source is those veins which are on the scalp, and you find no cause for treatment in medicine, and you see the patient's face already reddened and feel on their forehead a crawling as if it were the crawling of ants, and their eyes are swollen, moist, so that the hairs around them are matted, and the eyelids are inflamed by the acridity of the tears, the ancients greatly valued this operation in the treatment of this, and they called this treatment *spassa*.
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hairs which are on their forehead, and then incise three fissures in the forehead, equally distant according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure is two digits: one fissure should be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little of the movement of the muscles which are in the lacrimal duct, and the third on the other side.
And guard yourself from the incision of the arteries which are on both sides, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both jawbones. And if the space of each incision is the quantity of three adjusted digits.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or dried cloths ready, with which to dry the blood.
And then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of its incision: which is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Excoriate with that [tool/spatula] the whole ridge which is between the two incisions, with the [surgical] knife which is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove that spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a scalpel, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that [scalpel] against the flesh attached to the ridge, and its blunt edge against the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision be continued to that appearance of the ridge, and then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, press the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a pledget of old linen, and place on them powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and see that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day, untie the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5: On the treatment of tears caused by cataracts and descending to the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone experiences sharp and persistent cataracts, and the patient's eyes appear small and sunken, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their skin sheds, and there is sharp, persistent pain in the forehead and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the matter and cataracts originate from many veins proceeding from the inner parts.
And the best cure in such cases is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then incise a fissure in the middle of the forehead, a small one in width (and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be between the bones; and extend your hand from the temples’ lacerations, which are injured by chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth and then fill the space between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton or linen cloths. And then tighten above with powders soaked in wine and oil so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And when you unbind this and see that the abscess has diminished, then it is necessary that you scrape the bone until new flesh begins to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen which causes the flesh to grow, thus: if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and from them an emplaster is made and applied to these wounds to encourage the birth of new flesh.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of what falls into the ears.
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four types, for it is either a mineral stone or something similar to stone, such as iron or glass, or it is of plant origin, such as a seed or bean, or it is a fluid substance such as water and sour wine and things like them, or some animal.
And so when a stone falls into the ear or another similar thing amongst those things which do not adhere to or grow in the ear, and the ear is exposed to the sun, and if you see the stone, then instill into it some violet oil or sesame oil, and then administer its extraction, and induce sneezing with a [sneezing] powder, and plug the nostrils before the onset of sneezing. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear upwards, for often it is expelled by these means.
And if it is not expelled, then administer its extraction with the instrument called a delicate ear-spoon, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the spoon, good; and if not, then administer its extraction with a thin hook of little curvature.
And so if it is not expelled by that, then make a cannula of bronze and insert the end of the cannula into the opening of the ear and seal around the cannula with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open except the cannula. And then extract it with your breath with strong suction, for many times it is done with what we have recounted.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a small amount of lit tinder or something prepared with which birds are caught, and place that at the tip of a ray, and then carefully wrap a decent bandage over that. And then insert that into the opening of the ear easily, and then dry the ear of its humidity.
And so if it is not expelled by all the means which we have recounted, then you should consider cutting it out before it becomes a hot abscess or spasm.
And the manner of cutting it out is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to the patient's strength, and then hold the ear between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear below its cartilage in the well-prepared area. And let the incision be of a lunar shape until the stone is reached, and, the stone found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then sew the incision immediately with speed, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause falling into the ear is one of the [ear] stones that grows and is inflamed, then administer its cure and extraction; but if it does not obey your treatment, then take finely ground pumice stone according to this manner: and administer with that the excision of that stone which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it on thick cloths, and then extract it with tweezers or with a delicate instrument, or with an incision as we have said, for its extraction is thus eased.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing at the beginning, and fill his ear with some old cotton, and lie down on the ear in which the water is, and if it is expelled by this, it is good; and if not, then take some smooth, heated stones, about the length of a finger, and warm them a little in the fire, and the patient inserts one of these into the opening of his ear and jumps on one foot on that side and strikes it with another stone against the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And if the water is not expelled in this way, take some paper or tow, and put one end of it in the ear and apply the other end to a fire until most of it is burned.
And then put in more tow and do this several times until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula as described above for the extraction stone.
But in the extraction of a creature entering that ear, if it is small, like a fly or something similar, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is of a large size which appears to the sense of sight, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks, and the cause of this is the easiest of all the other causes that fall into the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your treatment is ineffective, then you must expose the ear to the sun.
And then, if any cause of the worms appears, extract it with forceps or with fine hooks; but if no cause appears, then take a cannula which is narrow below and wide above, of which this is the form: And insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and then suck with it strongly, and do this many times, until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not obey you in this way, then you plug and close the opening of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already proven in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion, with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear, be with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and flat above.
And so let it be so that it pushes what is in the cavity of the cannula to the outside where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take a ray (possibly referring to a thin, flexible instrument) and wrap its end decently with cotton, and then pour oil into the cavity of the ear, or the juice of some herb, or whatever you want of these medicines into the cannula — and that is in the ear —, and then introduce the ray with cotton on it and press with your hand, with a moderate compression, until the oil is expelled into the cavity of the hearing and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what is poured into the ear should be warmed a little by fire. And take care that what you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
On the treatment of ear obstructions.
Sometimes children are born from their mothers' wombs without perforated ears, and this also happens in some adults, an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or by flesh growing there; and this obstruction sometimes occurs in the inner part of the ear canal which prevents hearing, and sometimes in the outer parts.
And that which occurs in the inner part, which prevents hearing, is in the most difficult situations to heal.
And in that which allows hearing, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and examine it. And then if you see an apparent obstruction, open it with a fine spatula, of which this is the form:
If its extremity, where the width is small, has one sharp end and the other not; and let the spatula be two finger-widths wide so that it does not injure the ear.
And then, if the obstruction is due to flesh grown in the ear or its meatus, then take it with fine hooks and incise it vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is in the  entrance of the ear, then take a thin, fine  rod and heat it slightly with fire, and then place it in the ear canal.
And then, if you have felt an obstruction with what the patient finds easy [to feel], due to difficulty hearing,  remove the obstruction easily; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a linen cloth, according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for some days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take some wool and dip it in warm water and sprinkle it with finely ground [powder], and use it; and if you see the ear already to be festering, then you must remove the wool and replace it with other wool which you will wrap in a plaster made with rose oil, until the abscess is completely healed; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the other treatment which restricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which occurs on the eyelids.
Styes which occur on the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with forceps or with a hook, and incise them with a spatula from their roots, and then place a dressing on the incised area.
But if pain with bleeding occurs, then cauterize them with a thin, lentil-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains from their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often there appears on the eyelids of the eyes a certain something which resembles swelling in its firmness and hardness, and because of this swelling it is called [a swelling/tumor].
And it is an accumulation of thick humidity in the eyelid below and above.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider then if the swelling proceeds from what appears on the eyelid and is spread throughout; and its cause is light.
Then make an incision on it lengthwise, and gently peel it away entirely until it is removed, and then lift it with forceps and cut it off.
And if the wound is large, then you close it with sutures; and care for it until it is healed.
And if it is small, you will suffer no harm from it because the ointment will restore and heal it.
And if the growth is leaning towards the inner parts of the eyelid below the inner surface, then lift the eyelid and lift the growth with forceps, even if you need to make an incision, and press it from all sides, and if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, this does no harm.
Then, after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with a healing agent until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a stye on the eyelid above the eye.
A stye is a swelling that is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and mostly affects children; it aggravates their eyes and causes them much discomfort; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because of it, for tears well up in them.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and their lower eyelids, below the eyebrows, are moist, showing swelling, and the imminence of a stye is apparent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the stye within.
And a certain method of operation is this: the patient places his head in your lap, and you place a cloth on him and make him a compress, and you make a circle around the stye, according to the size needed to encompass the whole stye, and place it over the stye and press with your fingers all around so that the stye is gathered in the middle of the circle, and then make an incision into the middle of that swelling with a lancet, with a slit, the slit not being larger than the slit that is made in bloodletting.
But in the operation, it is necessary that you cut through the skin completely until you reach the stye, because in most cases, the stye is expelled through the incision as a white, purulent matter.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped around your fingers on the outside, and roll it between your right and left hand until it is gone.
And be careful that you do not push too hard in the incision so that with the lancet you do not reach the eye and injure it.
But if the stye does not appear at the beginning of the incision, press gently into the incision until the stye comes forth; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in wine and vinegar and apply them to the area, and compress those with powders.
And some crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision to draw out any remaining moisture.
And then care for it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs at the site, then treat it with healing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the various methods of treating the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes, pustules form beneath the natural skin and are persistent, then these harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as continuous tears and softening of the eyelids and membranes, until this causes destruction of the eye, which is called tacting of the eye. It is treated in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with acute medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery; or it is treated by incision and suture; or by canulae, as I shall explain.
And therefore it is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap; then, turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned, it is good; and if not, insert a needle into that which is full of pus beneath the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the pus upwards, and this should be – near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow – near the hairs, and pull the pus to the upper parts with the eyelid, and turn it back with a ray. (The "ray" here likely refers to a surgical instrument or a tool used to manipulate the eyelid.)
And then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the pustules with a small, sharp instrument from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller; and then extract the pus and place under the eyelid small powders of cotton or cloth, and then sew up the eyelid with a thread, and let it be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be according to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, for this varies in people, for some it is necessary that a large amount of the eyelid be incised, according to the amount by which the eyelid is softened.
And then make [an incision] with the instrument along the two lines which you have sewn, and begin from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller lacrimal duct. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a king's [hair/beard]. (The meaning is unclear, and "rey" likely needs clarification.  It may refer to a specific measurement related to thickness of hair or a tool.)
And then place the hook in one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape it all, and then join the two lips with glue or fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and stick what is superfluous of the threads over the two eyebrows with some adhesive substances, if you wish to do so, and if not, do not worry.
And then leave the suture of the threads for three or four days, and then care for it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without suture, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised by the sealing of the wound and its healing; but suture is better. And therefore the ancients advised this.
However, let there be diligence regarding the patient, and it is a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And there is another way to treat [this], and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three separate and joined hooks according to this form:
But if this is not possible, to hold the hooks, and this is not equal, then take a needle on which there is thread and place that in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads between your fingers with equality, and then with them, with equal elevation, raise the whole eyelid upon which the mark is made as we have recounted.
And then close the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with a plaster and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are inverted; then it is necessary that you use on that what we have said of incision; but suture in every case is more skillful [or artificial].
To straighten with splints is according to this method: and it is that you turn back the eyelid and cut the [skin] that is inside, as I have recounted; and then skillfully make two splints or two thin sticks whose length is according to the length of the eyelid and whose width is less than the width of the space [between the eye and the eyelid]. And you have already incised at the ends of each part, where you have the threads [or sutures].
Then carefully add each [splint] with subtlety over what is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the splints to each part with a strong binding, and leave it for some days, for the hair by the binding will die and be dried up and rot until it falls out by itself.
But if it is delayed, then break it with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Then, when it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two splints which you will make according to this form: and let it have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of the elevation of prickly hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is stiff.
When unnatural, hard, rough, and prickly hairs are in the eyes, then the operation is that you take a fine needle and place on it a fine silken thread and lion [possibly referring to a type of fine linen or a specific preparation], and then you adjust its ends and tie each one in a very subtle manner. And let the length of the threads be the quantity of a palm [handspan].
And then you prepare two other fine threads underneath, and tie their ends if you wish.
And then have the patient place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is illuminated, because it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the offending hair, which requires skill, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract it from above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair upwards and insert it into the alixati (likely a solution or substance), and let there be one, two, or three hairs, and no more.
And then pull your hand with that until the hair is expelled with the alixolati (likely a solution or substance) from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if the alixalati is drawn out and the hair is not expelled, you will draw the alixalati towards the lower parts with the bile which you have mixed with it, until the alixalati is expelled from the upper wound.
And observe that with the vision of the eye, for then you will expel the alixalati and the bile, and clean each and close the eye, and let it be closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is elevated with that, or you leave it until it is lengthened to a suitable space, and then you elevate it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of the hordeolum which appears on the upper eyelid.
When a hordeolum appears in the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound or incision or cautery, and it is called lagophthalmos, and this hordeolum is either natural or accidental, and is caused by the healing of a wound or incision or cautery, or similar poorly healed conditions.
The method of operation is that you should incise that adhesion and separate its lips, and place between them a pledget of linen cloth, and bind them until they are healed.
And it is not fitting that you use treatments which dry or constrict; for if you do this, the hordeolum will return worse than it was before.
Use on it things that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply it with water in which mallow and linseed have been boiled, or diachylon ointment, which should be liquefied with some oil, and soak the pledget in it, and treat with that.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you ensure by every means that it is not consolidated according to the way it was in the beginning.
And this operation which we have described is nothing but a correction of the hordeolum so that it does not return to its former state.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the treatment of a stye that forms on the lower eyelid.
This stye which forms on the lower eyelid, which is truly called a stye; and it is of a natural or accidental type in it.
But an accidental stye is caused by a wound, or by a cut, or by cautery, or by other similar things.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and pass it from the left lachrymal gland to the right lachrymal gland, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and sew it with the needle, and incise it with a wide spatula. And then if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good; and if not, take a splint and place it in the slit, and with it, reshape the eyelid, and close the two fissures in the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two fissures be two angles of the incision, which you have made so that they meet, and let an angle be formed between them, so that when they come together, their shape is formed.
And this shape is the Greek letter: lambda.
Then remove that flesh to the extent that the width of the sharp lower eyelid is, so that it becomes the eyelid.
And then join the separated parts and sew them together with wool thread; and then treat them with what we have said of emollient medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if it is excised due to fissure, suture, or cautery, then it is necessary that you make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid according to what has been described before. And then separate it with a poultice between two lips as we have said.
In summary, concerning the treatment of an excision whether above or below, let the operation proceed according to the preparation of the excision, which exists in many diverse forms.
And the skilled artisan always prepares the instrument in every way possible to restore the form to its natural state, or close to it, and the patient according to what is suitable for him in terms of operation and instruments in the best condition.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many men such that the eyelid is solidified above the white of the eye and its natural movement and function is impeded, then you must insert the tip of a probe beneath the eyelid and lift it up, or spread it with a probe.
And then you incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharply pointed, but rather blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed by the operation, and move the spatula so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision gently separate that adhesion until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and the adhesion is completely healed.
Then you put salt water in the eye with which you wash it; or distil into it some honey dissolved in water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a small spatula, and place wool infused with egg white on the eye, and then on the third day use consolidating remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the fleshy eminence of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types, for it is either nervous, and resembles a hard, thin shell; or it is non-nervous, resembling a congealed white humidity, which, when the iron touches it, or is forced to take hold with tweezers, is severed and the tweezers do not penetrate it.
And both types begin only from the major tear duct until it grows little by little, covering the sight and hindering light and eye movement.
But the manner of operating in its incision is that the patient places his head in your lap, then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with small, double-pronged tweezers and extend it towards the upper parts. Then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or ox hair, or cow hair, or something similar, or strong thread, or double the point of the needle little by little and insert it into the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it towards the upper parts, and scrape with the hair the edge of the nail which obscures the pupil. And thus you draw it with the hair into the back of it.
Then you incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula or with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that, by the incision of it, continuous flow of tears does not occur.
And sometimes the nail, with only tweezers extended, or with thread, as we have said, and then it should be scraped with a lion spatula, of which this is the form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and that a rupture occurs in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then, into the incision, put a little crushed salt or a poultice made of swine fat, and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed.
And if the nail is not infected and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it embedded in the quick, then many times this type of nail is cured with medicines, and it is healed as I have described and recounted in the section.
And if you wish to incise it, then you open the wound of the patient and take a thin lion spatula of sharp steel, according to this form: with subtlety. / delicately. And if you see that it is rarefied and is confined and pressed into that root, then distill from your still into the wound a poultice made of swine fat or with goose grease or with crushed salt, and occlude the wound until the next day.
And then repeat the operation on it until all that is there is removed, unless on the contrary a hot abscess forms in the wound, for then you leave that, and treat first the abscess until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it with reason until it is healed.
And the eminence of the lacrimal flesh, if noticeable in the wound through great damage, should be suspended with hooks; and incise it in part, and do not extend the incision so that you do not cut the flow of tears.
And then distill into the lacrimal [area] goose grease and swine fat until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the incision of a whitlow and of that which is born of flesh attached in the wound.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh is grown, and it is super-imposed until it covers the pupil, or approaches or tightens on the eyelids, and quickly compresses the eyelids to the outer parts and is similar to a rose of a balustrade.
But the operation on him is that the patient places his head in your lap; and then open the eyes of that one and collect all that flesh with suitable scissors for that, and hold that with forceps or with tweezers; and then incise the flesh at the beginning until all is finished with the lancet, and guard yourself from the eye that you do not injure it during your operation.
And let your incision with which you incise those be with a spatula which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which hair is collected, according to what the form of it will allow near this chapter.
Then when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, then fill the wound with crushed salt, or distill into it red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place over the wound outside a compress with egg white until it is secure from a hot abscess.
And if some cause of inflammation remains and hot blood is released, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat that abscess with what will relieve that abscess, and then iterate on it with an operation until it is healed, and similarly do in the swollen flesh which occurs in the eye of this kind.
But however, you should know that you should avoid all treatment of the weak eye by natural or accidental means, operating with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that that member can tolerate that operation.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the collection of pus in the eye.
Pus is bloody veins which are stubborn in the eye and prohibit the sight from its function, and weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and in it there is no other disease than pus; then you collect that pus.
And it is that you command the patient to place his head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with an ounce or two, according to your judgment; and let that ounce be of subtle duplication according to this form:
Or two ounces gradually in a single piece according to this form:
And then let those veins be collected with fine forceps, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those veins be removed from the eye and be retracted.
And take care that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is in the midday before the sun, and you are very firm in your operation that you do not incise except those veins.
And when you have completed [the procedure], then you distil onto the eye verdigris or vitriol so that with its sharpness it corrodes what has been removed from the eyelid.
But if this is not possible for you, collect everything at that time, and then you plaster everything with something that soothes his pain, and leave it for a few days until his pain is calmed and the risk of a hot abscess is averted.
And then repeat on him according to the same manner until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
On the reduction of nasal dislocations.
When you treat a nasal dislocation with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as narrated previously, and it is not healed, then there is no pus in it, but rather fissures on the abscess before its maturation. You should extract all the humidity which is within it and the pus until the bone is uncovered.
And then, when the bone is uncovered and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is named a rasp, and it should be made of Indian iron, and its head should be round like a chisel, which should be pointed by filing or sharpened by subtle pointing (as it is in the following form).
And place that [rasp] upon the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that that corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Then, if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown there, and the body of the pus is excised and remains for forty days, and is not renewed and is not festering and no accident befalls it, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is nothing to do but to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and according to this manner:  it is that you uncover the underlying bone with an iron instrument or with a sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a trephine according to this form:
Let the end of the iron trephine be triangular, and its shaft be slender, tapering to the end like this.
And then place that [trephine] on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and move your hand a little away from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the trephine until it penetrates the whole bone, and the patient will feel this because they will feel air escaping when you hold their hand.
Then restore the place with styptic and drying medicines as has been shown to you.
Then, when the flesh grows and the place is hardened, the matter which flowed to the outer parts returns to the nose, therefore this is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the protrusion of the eye.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety and there is no accompanying wound, lesion, or diminution, then it is necessary to leave the patient at rest, and see that he is followed up, and apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification and suction for good evacuation; and apply to the eye an ointment which is made of [ingredients: the text seems to be listing ingredients, but precise translation requires knowing what "acatra" is,  and the others may also be medieval names], and tightly bind a plaster over the eye with much powder.
And the method of the powders is that you take many lion's cloths, and each cloth should be folded in four layers; and make many of them.
And then place those one on top of the other according to the amount the eye needs. And then bind tightly over them with a strong cloth with firm pressure; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is softened, then it must be bound very tightly.
And then remove the binding during the day and night, as we have said.
And if sometimes the eye is already reduced, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders and the binding and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the incision of the eminence of the uvea tunic.  (Note: "uvea tunic" refers to the uvea, the pigmented middle layer of the eye.)
When there is a rupture in the uvea tunic, and it is prominent and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a grape, and the shape of the eye is marred by it, and you wish to incise it, then the operation is as we have recounted, that you insert the needle into the root of the uvea from below upwards, and then place another needle with double thread from the lachrymal (tear duct) side, and make it penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; and then incise the place with the double thread and lift with it the portion of the uvea in the circumference of the needle, and tighten it strongly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white and let the thread adhere to the uvea.
And then treat the eye with whatever strengthens it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes gather from all sides with a circle of cloth within the eye the large prominent area, and then it is perforated with a thin spatula that reaches the pupil of the eye, and the albugineous (whitish) moisture flows, and the eye descends and enters immediately.
And then tighten it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of alconati (likely a type of eye disease or injury).
This illness, which is called alconati, is nothing but a swelling which is located in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not that.
But the way to work on it is to make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, and then take their head in your hands on both sides and gently press it until you see the swelling descend to the lower parts, and then it should be dried so that it does not descend, and light should be blocked, and the patient should see the causes like that as they saw.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the swelling is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and take a thin spatula and use it on the pannicle, gently scraping near the conjunction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the crown (towards the empty space), until the swelling is expelled.
Then, when it is expelled, you instill warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have previously boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then it should be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of the watery discharge from the eye.
We have already discussed the types of watery discharge in the division and which ones are appropriate to treat with cautery, then that which follows according to the health of the patient.
Then you should make the patient sit between your legs on a chair and bind their healthy eye shut, tying it tightly.
Then place your left hand near the eyelid of their eye, if the eye with the watery discharge is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is the left one; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then place the tip of the almond near the cornea, along the edge of the iris in the white of the eye, on the side of the tear duct, and then gently press the almond and roll your hand with it.
And then penetrate the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached the empty space (or cavity).
And it should be that the path of the almond to the preon (likely referring to a specific anatomical point near the pupil) is the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the edge of the blackness (iris), and that is the cornea of the eye; for you will see with that pupil through the clarity of the corneal tunic.
And then place the almond into the place where the water (presumably referring to aqueous humor) is, and then you draw it down one time then another, and then if the water descends immediately, then the patient will see that upon which he focuses his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
And then rest a little; then if the water has descended, you should remove the almond before it is expelled.
And then when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond easily, and gently roll it with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the water and wash the eye inside with it; and then place on the outside of the eye cotton or tow or wool infused in rose oil and egg white and bind the eye with this.
But we and those of our time place upon that a bruised comfrey (herb) with egg white.
And if the almond does not obey you upon entering the eye because of its hardness—for there are some men whose eyes are very hard—then it is necessary that you take the spatula which is called an alberid, of which this is the form:
And then perforate that joint with it, and do not thrust your hand into the hole, and it is only that you make a subtle pathway for the almond.
And then introduce the almond as we have said.
And for the completion of your work, let the patient be prepared a quiet, dark sleeping place where he may lie on his back, and let all movement be prohibited.
And place him in such a position that his body is aligned, and he does not turn his head to the right or left at all.
And let the dressing remain, according to its suitability, until the third day.
And then unbind it in that dark place and expose the ulcer to view, and show him certain things, and then reapply the dressing until the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that you do this at the hour of the treatments or immediately after the infusion. Beforehand, it is necessary that you remove this, because the water might lightly, through great and vehement examination, [escape/leak/be lost].
But if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you unbind the wound before the seventh day, and treat it with something that reduces the abscess.
Then you cleanse his sight and place over his face a poultice by which his sight may be governed beneath him for some days, him existing in the darkest place.
And then let him be removed from that dark place gradually and attend to his matters/affairs.
And know that in the case of a cataract, the pupil is not excused from vision at certain times, and then you should be bold about the operation.
And it has come to us from some of those who are in Artach, and some say that fire is made in Ayrac, a perforated vessel by which the water is sucked.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read this in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the kinds of vessels, so that he who is ignorant of them may know them:
And let them be made of bronze or iron properly, and let their ends be with this triangular subtlety, the sharp end thus, as that is the form.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of rotting flesh in the nose.
When in the nose there are born various fleshy growths, of which some are similar to a very small scorpion, or to a polyp fish; and this illness is called polyp because it resembles that fish in appearance. And from it is cancerous flesh,  scaly, of dark color; and from it is flesh like a lion, not of dark color.
Therefore, in that which is in these fleshy growths, not malignant nor cancerous, you should make the patient sit between your hands and place [him] in the sun, and open his nostrils, and lightly touch those growths with your finger. Then extract that to the outside parts, and then incise what you have grasped of those growths with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; that if any part remains from which excision is possible, then you scrape that with one of the subtle instruments easily until nothing remains of it. But if it bleeds profusely or a hot abscess forms, then you should apply what is necessary; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you should incise and cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the cavities are removed.
Then let there be poured into the nose near the incision, strong wine and water or wine. But if the nose is open and moisture flows from it into the palate, then know that it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that inside there is flesh or pus remaining in the upper bones of the nose to which excision has not reached.
Then it is necessary that you introduce a linen thread into it, to which some thickness is added, and tie knots in it, placing between each knot the quantity of a finger or less, and  guide the patient, and introduce one end of the thread into the nose with a rod or with any other means that is possible for you.
And after this is done, let it draw its odor until it reaches the canals of the nose, and it will come out over the throat, because often children do something similar at school, and it is an easy thing for someone who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end emerging from the nose and the other remaining inside the nose, and then administer sawdust or small pieces of meat with the knots that are on the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is now held by the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread, and place near the nose, near the extraction of blood, a warm compress, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then, at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
But if you need a more drastic cure, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument, a nasal purgative, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And make this of silver or bronze, which should resemble a small open lamp, like a small shell, and the opening similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the nasal purgative instrument should be flat and open;  it should have a handle at its rear, with which you hold it when you heat the oil or whatever you want of the juices and extractable substances in it.
Chapter 25.
Of the pimples [or boils] in the extremities of the nose.
Many times a pimple forms in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in a few days to the point that it is easily visible.
And for that reason it is necessary that you incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it. And then place on the area either a cautery or a burning medicine which will remain in place.
But if its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is hardened, firm, of a dark color, and with little feeling; then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess; because many times whoever incises this abscess suffers great harm from it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch and not of a dark color, and sometimes incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and treat the area with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Chapter 26. Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when their continuity is broken by a wound or similar injury.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, you should rarely undertake that operation except in certain cases.
Therefore, when such a thing happens to someone, consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then you should approximate the two lips of the wound with sutures, and afterwards treat it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each is healed, then you must scarify each part of its apparent edge until blood comes out. Then approximate the two lips with sutures and tighten them, and over them sprinkle dragon's blood and finely ground egg shells, and place over the powder a piece of diachylon plaster, or some other consolidating plaster, and leave it bound for two or three days, then unbind it and change the plaster and leave it until the stitches themselves are removed, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
But the manner of suturing is that you should close the solution of continuity either with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the abdomen, or close the solution of continuity with thread, as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things which come between the two lips in the inner parts.
Often there appear in the inner parts of the lips of many men certain hard abscesses resembling goose grease, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you should separate the lips and open each of those hardnesses on all sides, and then fill the place of the abscess with crushed sage until the bleeding is stopped, and then wash it with sharp wine and treat the place with something styptic until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the incision of the flesh grown in the gums.
Very often a fleshy growth appears on the gum, which the ancients called an albulus; then it is necessary that you lift that up with forceps or hold it with forceps and incise it down to its root, and let the serum or blood flow.
And then place crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders on the place.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it, for then the cautery will prevent it from returning.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both inner and outer parts, and between the gums, rough, sticky, and sometimes blackened crusts are found, and they become citrine or green, extending to the gum, then corruption occurs due to this, and the teeth become loose.
And therefore it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and rest their head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those crusts and similar substances appear, like sand, until none remains, removing the blackness, yellowness, and other substances until they are cleaned.
Therefore, if what was mentioned at the beginning of the treatment is achieved, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the treatment on those teeth on the following day, and the second, and the third, until you finally achieve what you want.
And know that teeth require many different kinds of instruments and various shapes, according to the preparation for your operation. And because the instrument with which the tooth is scraped from the inside is different from the instrument with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms, these forms of instruments must be prepared by you, which you will see immediately:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
That you treat the tooth's pain with all skill and delay its extraction, for there is no cause that compensates for its loss when it is extracted, for it is a sublime substance whose extraction is to be excused.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is affected, for many times the pain deceives the patient and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and aching tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operation of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which tooth is aching, and you know it well, then you should scarify around the tooth with a spatula containing some virtue, until it is loosened from the gum on all sides, and then remove it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, little by little at first, until it is completely loosened.
And then apply strong, large forceps for good traction or firm hold, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold him well and he does not move, and then pull the tooth straight in such a way that you do not break it, nor cause the patient greater pain.
And then, if it is not removed, take one of those instruments and place it under the tooth on all sides with ease, and force its removal in the same way as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you should fill that crack with cloth and tighten it with a fine thread so that it is not broken at the moment of your traction on it with forceps.
And you must carefully open with scarification around all parts of the gum and take great care that you do not break it and leave part of it behind, and it returns to the patient with even worse consequences than the initial pain.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and boldness in extraction, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to cure, and their roots remain behind, either all of them, or some of them, or they extract them along with some bones from the jaw, as we have witnessed many times.
And after its extraction, the mouth should be washed with hot wine or vinegar with salt.
And if bleeding ensues from this, as often happens, then crush some quantity of alum and sprinkle it on the wound, and if this alum does not work, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and the fine tongs with which the tooth is grasped at the beginning should be long in the gripping part, short and thick in the handles, so that they do not bend when you use them.
And let them be of such thickness in the handles that when you squeeze them, they are not bent; let the gripping parts be short.
And let them be made of Indian iron, carefully made with straight gripping parts, and at the ends of these let there be teeth, some interlocking with others, and clamping with strong constriction.  And sometimes the ends of these should be shaped like the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* (that is, a stork), and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
On the removal of teeth and the extraction of broken jawbones.
When you must remove a tooth which is fractured and some part remains, then you should place a poultice on the area for a day or two until the area is softened; and then insert forceps, whose ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* or stork, the shape of forceps:
Their ends should be made inside like a file or rasp.
And if it does not yield to you easily with these forceps or pincers, then you should excavate around the root and remove all the flesh and insert the instrument which is called an *atali*, that is, a small lever, whose shape is this:
And let it have a short, somewhat thick end, and let it not be curved so that it will not break.
Therefore, if by this the root is extracted, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is of a triangular end, which should have some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and of a more subtle/fine point.
And you are already aided with this instrument having two prongs, of which this is the form approximately/following: and with other instruments which precede in tooth extraction; for help is made with this instrument which resembles a large hook, and this is its form:
of a triangular, curved or short end, which should have some thickness, and should not be bent so that it is not broken.
And know also that the instruments for molars are similar to the other instruments.
But the wise and subtle artisan in the art finds for himself, according to what the operation and the various diseases signify to him; for there are diseases to which the ancients did not give or devise a proper instrument, because of the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth is broken, or if it can be, then let it be cured in its place with what is convenient for it from among the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help yourself with a splint, of which this is the form:
And let there be some thickness in it little by little, and let it be tightened or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely set; and then restore the place with medicines convenient to it.
But if in the bone there is a small rottenness, then scrape away that rottenness and its blackness, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth that are prominent above the others.
When the teeth are prominent, not according to their natural course, their form is flawed, and especially when it happens to women, and especially to venerable old women; therefore you must consider: if a tooth is close to another tooth, and closure or alignment is not possible, then extract it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you should incise it with this instrument, of which this is the form; and it is similar to a boar's tusk, and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision, with which you incise it, be done in several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other teeth are injured.
And if it is a prominent tooth suitable for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of which this is the form:
And let it be entirely of Indian iron and very sharp; and let it have very small points, like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over several days easily, so that no other tooth is injured or damaged. Then smooth it at the end, and scrape it with some scrapers.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and injures the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and it is filled so that the tongue is not injured nor the speech impaired.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and loosening from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats, and you have treated this with styptic medicines, and your treatment has not been effective, then, so that they do not fall out, contrive that they be fastened with gold wire and not silver, for silver turns green and soon powders after a few days, but gold is never changed.
And let the wire be of such fineness and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the manner of binding is that you take the wire and pass double the length between two healthy teeth, and then let it loop with two turns of wire between the damaged ones, whether one or several, until the wire reaches a healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving back to the point where you began, and tighten with your hand gently and skillfully until it is firm.
And let your tightening, with which you fasten the wire, be around the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose.
And then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and smooth those ends at each location, and fold them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightened, like a Roman [brace/bandage].
But if it is loosened or broken, tighten it or them with another wire in the same manner at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, thus as you see these bound:
And when it is done that one or two teeth return to the alignment of each in their places, and they are grown as we have recounted, and they remain firm.
And this is only done by good and skilled artisans.
And sometimes some material from cow bones is used, and it is fashioned into the shape of a tooth, and is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and is fixed as we have said, and remains and serves in that way for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the incision of the ligament which occurs in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which is found under the tongue, is sometimes natural, with which one is born, or accidental and occurs due to a wound which has already healed.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, their head being in your lap; and raise their tongue, and then incise that nervous ligament according to its width until the tongue is freed from its restriction.
But if in that area there is some hardness or knotting, and this is due to the healing of a wound, then you make an incision and divide it across its width until you have incised the ligament and the knotting is dissolved.
And be careful that no fissure is made in the base of the flesh and that you do not cut too deeply and cause a flow of blood.
Then let the site of the incision be washed with warm water or with sour wine or with cold water; and then place under the tongue linen; that is, a cloth which the patient should keep under their tongue each night so that it does not heal again.
But if bleeding occurs, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a lancet-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess resembling a small tumor occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and it is quickly enlarged until it fills the mouth.
And the operation on it is that you open the patient's mouth, sitting in front of the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black in color, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, and is moist, then you place your fingernail there, and incise it with a fine spatula, and incise it in all parts; and if blood flows during your operation, then you place crushed verdigris, that is, verdigris, upon it until the bleeding is stopped.
Then return to your work until you have completely removed it, until it is washed with sharp vinegar and salt; and treat it with the other appropriate treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. On the extraction of an abscess from the two ears and from that which is located in the throat and of other abscesses.
When a swelling occurs in the throat, these are glands which are gathered together like cotton, which protrude externally and are called tonsils; when you treat them with what we have said in the previous section and it is not healed, then you consider if the abscess is hard, of a dark color, with little sensation; then do not touch it with an iron instrument.
And if it is red and the root is thick, then do not touch it with an iron instrument because of the flow of blood; rather, let it mature, and then either you will extract it, or it will burst of its own accord.
And if it is white, soft, and its root is thin, then it is one that should be incised.
And the operation is that you consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already matured through complete rest or if it has diminished; and then have the patient sit facing the sun, with their head in your lap, and open their mouth, and the assistant, taking hold with their hands, presses down the patient's tongue with a very fine instrument of which this is the form:
And let it be made of silver or bronze, and let it be as thin as a knife.
Then, as you press the tongue with that and the abscess is shown to you, and you look at it carefully, then take tweezers and place them in the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can. Also, if you pull out something from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form:
Also, if you pull out something from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it resembles forceps, however its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a spatula of which this is its form: And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one side, incise the other in the same manner of incision, and immediately after the incision, let the patient rinse with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, rinse with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and similar styptic substances until the flow of blood is restrained, and immediately treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two ears, and incise those as I have said in the incision of two sides equally.
And I myself once treated a woman with an abscess which had formed in her throat, which abscess was of a dark color, with little feeling, which had already closed her throat, and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her food and drink of water, and she would have reached death if she had lasted one or two more days.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had made two openings through which it exited.
Therefore I treated it with a fistula, and inserted a probe into one of the openings, and pulled it, and a large portion was extracted from it. And immediately I incised the part which I understood to be related to the other opening, and immediately I opened its mouth, and compressed its tongue, and immediately I inserted the probe into that abscess.
And immediately I excised a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore the throat of that woman was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, and soon she took food. Therefore I did not cease to incise that abscess many times over a long time, and another abscess succeeded the first, which I incised until it was completely healed.
Therefore I cauterized his throat, thus I stopped the infection; and immediately I went for a walk and did not know what God would do about it immediately.
Chapter 37.
Concerning the incision of a wen when it is abscessed.
When catarrh descends to the uvula and it is abscessed and elongated, then it is called a perpendicular swelling; and if it is in the lower part, thick and round, then it is called a bubo.
But when it is treated with what we have said in the division, and your treatment is not effective, and you see that the cauterized abscess is removed from it and is subtle, then you should incise that which is round and aggregated; and if it is of such length, and is bloody, of dark color or black, and there is no feeling in it, then you should avoid incising it, for in this there is danger for the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner I have described, its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit and press down their tongue with an instrument of appropriate shape, and then insert the lancet into the uvula, and pull it downwards and incise it with one of the two instruments which are described in the incision of the tonsils.
And you should not incise it except for that which is within the natural limit without addition, for if you incise more, you will impair their speech.
And for the incision, use what we have recommended in the incision of the tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, you should use ingenuity in cauterizing it without causing fear, and the method of cauterizing it is only with sharp water, and it is that you place the patient's head in your lap, and then press their tongue with the instrument we have mentioned, and then take the water which we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with a live coal, and do not apply it thickly or thinly, and with this fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the shape:
Let its extremity be concave, in which the medicine is placed, like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and let the patient lie on their side so that saliva or mucus from their mouth flows away because of the inward medicine, so that nothing descends from it onto their throat and harms them.
And then take your hand with the medicine, and press it on the uvula for half an hour until you see it become blackened and dried by the bite of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and submerge the cotton in the medicine, and insert the spoon with the cotton into a tube above so that the cotton adheres to that tube, and do this as many times as needed until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it because it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
And if you judge that you should repeat the medicine, repeat it, and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in wine, and cleanse with it what remains around it from the medicine, and wash it with cold water, and treat externally with an embrocation, and internally with gargles until it is healed.
And this kind of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with a method more subtle than cautery or incision, because it is cured with fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, origanum, rue, dried arabic gum, chamomile,  and similar herbs, and combine all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them in sour wine, and boil; and the pot should be well sealed with a suitable lid, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hole, over which a concave instrument of brass should be placed in this manner; it may be made of silver or brass.
And insert the end [of the concave instrument] into the patient's mouth so that the vapor may reach the uvula through the funnel, until the uvula is sufficiently fumigated.
And then repeat this several times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the development of an abscess, because it would excessively irritate the abscess, and you should not do that, but rather you should treat the declared abscess with cautery.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a reed and attach a piece of eggshell to its end, so that the patient's mouth may be protected, because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and that which adheres in the throat and other causes.
Many times a fish bone or some other thing adheres in the throat.
Then it is necessary that you extract that which is apparent, upon which your sight falls, after you pull the tongue forward with an instrument in the sunlight, so that that which is in the throat may be revealed to you.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for very quickly the cause attached to the throat will be expelled by vomit; or that the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge, and bind it tightly with bile, and then have the patient swallow it, for when it arrives at the place where the thorns are, it will extract them and they will be expelled. And moreover, take an eel and bind it with bile, and let it be put inside and quickly extracted; or take a leek and quickly insert it and quickly remove it.
But if they are not expelled by those means which we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be thicker than a finger by a little, and at its end let there be a concavity which you introduce into his throat with ease.
And he should have his head raised up, and be careful not to touch his throat bone, so that it does not happen to him that with that you push the bone or the thorn, or that the physician does it with his hand.
But however, it is better that the patient himself introduce it, because of his knowledge of the location of the attached cause, and pushes it down, and pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the amount that is prepared for him until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
Concerning the extraction of a leech attached to the throat.
When a leech is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not work, then consider placing the patient's throat in the sun, after you have compressed his tongue with the instrument which we have recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with small forceps or with gentle, careful movements.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and detaches from the throat) and abstain from water all day.
And then take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth into it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not swallow anything from it and stir the water every now and then with your hand, because the leech immediately falls when it feels the water.
But if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with cyme (or possibly *cyminum*, cumin) or with asafoetida using the instrument that we recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall.
And another method of operation in the fumigation of it, is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals, and the pot is covered with a cover in the middle of which is a hole, and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then let the fumigation go out from above; and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will immediately fall.
And if it does not fall, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and eating salty things and garlic, and do not drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this regime it will be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is drawn from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps like these sometimes, except that there is some curvature in it: which is placed in the throat, and the end of it is similar to a stork's beak, which is hollow, in which there is a roughness from filing, so that, when it grasps something, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the sum of the discourse concerning the opening of abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are of many species, of many kinds, according to what their recollection shows, of each one in this book.
And they are diverse in their perforation and incision in two ways, of which one is by the species of abscesses themselves; and by what we understand of the humors.
And the second way is according to the locations in which they occur in the body, for an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in a joint; and each has its own judgment for operation.
And moreover, some abscesses should not be perforated except near the maturation of the pus within them or their completion.
There are other abscesses which should be opened when they are raw, and not yet matured according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near the joints, because when an abscess is near a joint, its being is prolonged until it consumes that which is in its circumference, and very quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, wherefore a cause of contraction of that limb is made; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay its perforation until it is matured, you will harm the principal member; or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it even if not matured; and you should not perforate it raw, of incomplete digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that its pus may not flow and be elongated to the inner parts of the anus, and a fistula be made, or that it be made in such a way that it is not healed. Moreover, you must know the time for the perforation of the abscess, and this is when it is matured.
And know that it is matured when there is a lessening of the pain and the cessation of the fever, and also the diminution of the redness and of the pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know how to make the perforation fall into the lowest part of the abscess and from where the cure proceeds from the prominence.
And the perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the place of the tendons, of the cords of the nerves, of the arteries; and, finally, in all smooth places where there is no reflection; because in those which are reflected, use a perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better that you leave the perforation of it until its digestion is completed, as we have said; for if you perforate it before that, the course of its pus and much filth is prolonged, and very quickly its lips are hardened and its depth increased.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body because of necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and in large abscesses a large and wide perforation, or many incisions, according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be incised and hollowed out, when it is made like bread and is ripe, as happens in cases of buboes and swellings.
And some of these are incised with a three-angled incision; and others are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the armpits.
And there are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered, and similar ones.
But that which is not like the aforementioned superficial abscesses, you must perforate only with a superficial or flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should perforate it and do not worry about extracting all the pus at once; having extracted a portion of it, then pack the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger portion, and do this many times gradually until it is completely evacuated.
Especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in decrepitude, because the animal spirit is often dissolved with the egress of pus, and the patient dies very quickly, and you open them.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and concerning your perforation in which you perforate these abscesses, you must clean the wounds and consider whether the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision; then you apply lint or old linen; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you must place a wick in each opening until they join together.
And if in the abscess a part of the skin is excised or you have hollowed it out in a circle, then you must fill it with old linen or thread made from linen cloth, as when you have drawn out splinters or roots, without moisture; and dress it on the third day; and then treat it and care for it with the ointments needed until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and sour wine in which you soak a linen cloth, and apply this to the bleeding site many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must administer the regimen and treatment and powders which I have described in many places in this our book and division.
But if it is winter, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you must mix powders in warm wine and oil, and apply those to the area.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders moistened with water and oil or with wine and oil, and all this should be cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should open the abscess and cleanse it and administer to its treatment what is appropriate for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally, but according to the way of distinction I have already spoken of every abscess, in what manner is the way of its treatment, by chapters individually.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the scalp.
In the scalp, small abscesses are found, and they are a type of node which contains tunics that are in their layers; and their types are many.
And some of them are purulent, and those contain a humidity similar to slime. And some of them contain a humidity similar to pus, and resembling it; and some of them are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, since the extraction of those does not cause contrary harm.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is appropriate for this, which is called a probe, until you know what it contains.
For if what it contains is humidity, then incise it lengthwise with a superficial incision according to this form:
And begin the incision from line B to line G.  Then, when the humidity is evacuated, you scrape that skin which contained the humidity, and do not leave any of it behind, for often the malady returns if any of it remains.
And then submerge cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it and leave it there until the next day, for with this you corrode everything that is remaining of that membrane.
And then repeat the application of cotton with Egyptian ointment a second and third time if necessary, until you are confident that no part of that membrane remains; then heal the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you incise it according to this form: with an incision in the shape of a cross, and insert forceps between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from every part, and exert your strength in the extraction of the tunic which contains it.
But if your attempt meets with resistance, then do what I recounted to you at first.
And similarly proceed with a stony abscess in incision and treatment as we have told you; and incision on a stony abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes some of these abscesses, which are in the head in some men, have no moisture at all; the reason for this is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a dull, rough, white stone, which could not be cut, and if anyone were struck with it, it would hurt them.
But in other accidental abscesses in the head other than this, this chapter does not apply, such as abscesses that occur on the heads of children and behind the roots of the ears, but the incision of these should all be superficial incisions.
And make the perforation of those in the lowest part of them so that the body is relieved of the pus in the lower parts.
And then treat those with what is appropriate for that treatment.
Chapter 42.
Chapter 42. On the incision of scrofulas which occur in the neck.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and in the armpits, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, and many that are generated among them, and every scrofula of those is within its own tunic, and just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for some of them are stony, and some of them contain humidity, and some of them are malignant which do not obey cure.
Therefore, in that which you see to be of good disposition on touching, of which the color that is manifestly apparent is close to the color of the flesh, and is softened in every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not deep, it is fitting that you incise that with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line of G. within the line of B., and scrape that from every part, and extend the lips of the incision with forceps, or with many forceps if you have need of them, just as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract that little by little.
And it is most important that the vein or nerve not be incised.
And let the scalpel not be too sharp, lest it slip in your hand during the incision, or that it disturb the patient, and that you incise what is not necessary to incise; for if you incise a vein or artery and prohibit yourself from your operation, then place on the wound crushed vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides and the wound is softened and begins to become purulent. When the blood is cut off.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire with your finger if there is any cause of the other small scrofulas, then incise those and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, then you must not incise that scrofula at its root. Beforehand, it is necessary that you bind that with strong doubled thread and that you leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen that you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then care for it.
And if you incise the entire scrofula, then you must adjust the two lips of the wound and stitch it as soon as there is no remaining superfluity.
But if you see that there remains superfluity because of the size of the scrofula, you must understand how to incise its root, and extract it and administer suture and what has been said.
And as for those scrofulas that contain humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation where the place of its maturation appears to you, and position the perforation so that it is the lowest part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer a perforation, perhaps with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound to be already cleansed, then you cure it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the head of the abscess accidentally within the throat.
The ancients described this incision in the abscess, but no one in our land has been seen to have performed it.
And this is the description/writing of the discourse of those (people/ancients).
But in men having a throat abscess, the extraction of the head (of the abscess) must be avoided, because it would not be beneficial, for all the veins and major ones of the patient are there.
But in those who have abscesses located in the mouth or throat or in both ears, when the illness is not in the throat (itself/specifically), it is necessary to use the incision of the head (of the abscess) to avoid the damage that is done by perforation (or, a more literal translation, "that which is made by piercing").
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the head (of the abscess) below the three circles of the circles of the head (of the abscess), or four with a small incision in the width, which is between two circles in quantity, so that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for incision, because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are far away.
And if the physician is timid/fearful, then it is necessary that he extend the throat's lining with a hook, and then split the lining until he reaches the canal, but he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
And then incise the membrane as we have recounted; and the incision of the canal is indicated by the inflammation which comes from it with what is broken from it and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Then, as the time is reached in which perforation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound's lining, and sew that alone, without the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the discourse which we have recounted, the explanation is only that you see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the throat of the patient, and the patient has come close to death, and his breath is cut off, and some proceed to incise the epiglottis so that the patient may breathe above the location of the wound for some respiration, and be saved from death.
And for that reason I order the wound to be left open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed; and its malignancy lasts for three days; and then I order the wound to be sewn, and cure it until it is healed.
And this which I have seen with my own eyes, is that a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and incised with it a part of the windpipe, and I was called to her cure, and I found the mucus as it is found in those who are dying, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood which had come out from the small wound.
Then I was confessed that she had not incised a vein or artery, and the wind issued from the wound, and I cured it until it was healed.
And there occurred to the servant nothing but hoarseness in the voice, and after some days she returned to improvement in her condition.
And now I say that in the incision of the throat there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Concerning incision upon an abscess which occurs in the throat externally, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess named throat hernia is a large abscess according to the constitution of the body, and is very common in women.
And it is according to two manners, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural [case], there is no way to cure it.
And the accidental is according to two manners, of which one resembles fatty nodes, and the other manner resembles an abscess which is caused by a knotting of an artery, and in that case there is fear [of danger]. And it is not fitting that one should use iron [surgery] on him except in that which is small. And you probe that and investigate it with the finger; and if you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you incise it like the nodes, and extract it with that which contains it from the skin and blister; and if not, then its entire being is examined, and then cure the place with that which is needed for healing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the incision of the types of nodes.
There are many types of nodes, and I have already described all their types in the division [of chapters].
And it is necessary that I recount thus the difference between a node and an abscess, lest there be doubt.
Therefore I say that with an abscess there is heat and fever and vehement pain until the boiling of the superfluity is settled; and putrefaction is complete, then the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that lymphatic fluid which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a swelling and is made like a vesicle, either larger or smaller, and there are two kinds, for they are either fatty and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division [of chapters].
Therefore it is necessary, when you arrive at the cure of a node, that you explore it and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument which is called a probe, according to the form which will appear in the chapter which is next to this one.
And the manner of investigating abscesses and all nodes is that you take this instrument and introduce it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you will move your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the pus.
And then place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the probe and consider what has come out in its wake.
And if the flowing humidity, of whatever color it may be, is expelled, then you should incise it with a superficial incision as I have said in the case of other abscesses.
And if no humidity comes from the wake of the probe, then know that it is fatty (or thick/dense).
And dry it out with an incision in the form of a cross, according to this shape: as I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and easily peel the skin from all sides, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract that pus with the node (or knot, referring to a surgical instrument).
But if it is broken during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the pus, and this often happens, and then you extract it in pieces until nothing remains.
Because if anything remains, little or much, the node (or abscess) will return again.
And if you see that some small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and bind the wound tightly, and place a hot poultice over it, and treat it with other cures until it is healed.
And if it is a large node (abscess), then you sew the two lips of it together and treat it so that it heals by granulation (fleshing over).
But if a pulsating vein is found in the opposite direction or a non-pulsating one, then you cauterize and fill the area with crushed vitriol and leave it tight for two or three days until the wound dries and the boiling of the blood ceases; and then return to incise what remains of the node.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of the instruments necessary in incision and perforation.
Of these are the forms of the instruments, and there are three kinds: some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They should be made of iron, of alum, with appropriately rounded ends, so that they may easily enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called *albereds*, and one of them is called a *berid*.
And they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
The form of the large instrument, its form is:
The form of the medium instrument, its form is:
The form of the small instrument, its form is:
It is fitting that they be used for those abscesses and discharges and fistulas and buboes, because among those are those from the bones and from other causes.
And they are made round, large, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of citrine brass, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver. And the best are those made of citrine brass.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are suitable for opening fistulas in the concavity of which reflections are present, so that they may be reflected with their lightness onto those reflections.
And they are of three types, for some of them are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its stricture.
Form of the large lead instrument:
Form of the medium lead instrument:
Form of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many types, for some of them are simple, which have only one curve, and are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them there are hooked ones, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types.
And of them there are [hooks] having three curves, and they are of three types.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Form of a small simple hook, its form:
Form of a large hook having two curves. Form of a medium hook having two curves. Form of a small hook having two curves.
Form of a large hook having three curves.
Form of a medium hook having three curves.
And these are the forms of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped, and they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Form of a large scalpel:
Form of a medium scalpel:
Form of a small scalpel:
The ends of those with which the incision is made are sharp and the other ends are not sharp, and they are not placed in such a way except that the scraping of the nodes may be done easily, fearing the incision of a vein or nerve, and through them the patient may be healed and find a little tranquility through the cauterization which he finds during the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the forms of the scalpels, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They should be made of bronze and similar to a ray, with which an alcofol (a type of surgical instrument, possibly a speculum or similar) is made.
And it is at the pointed end, hidden with a sheath, and in that way it reaches the inner and outer parts, when you wish, as you see.
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers for the perforation of abscesses and the patient does not perceive them, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those (instruments):
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is interrupted, and there are three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They should be made of bronze, round with some length, and they should be thin.
And it is necessary that there be these types of cupping glasses: large, medium, and small, so that with them you interrupt the flow of blood quickly when necessary, and then when other medicine is not initially effective.
However, do not use these to draw blood from every part of the body, but only in fleshy places, such as the fleshy parts of the legs and thighs, and in the fleshy parts of the arms, and of the breasts and abdomen and shoulders, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes other small instruments are made, similar to small bladders, according to this shape; through which blood is drawn when it is done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein, or by scarification.
And sometimes they are made round according to this shape:
Chapter 47.
On the treatment of the breasts of men which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are inflamed due to excessive sleep, and then the breasts become inflamed and resemble those of women, and remain as purulent, leprous sores.
And for someone who has this, it is necessary to incise them with a lunate incision, according to this form, from line B to line G, and then excise all the thickness, and then fill the wound with incarnative medicine, and then approximate the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the nipple declines towards the lower parts and is softened by its size, as it happens in women, then it should be split in its two superior sides, with two incisions similar to a lunar figure, each contained within the other, until the major line contains the minor, according to this form, from line B to line G. And then excise the skin that is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about the suture and the powders, which is necessary in the healing until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision that should be made because of the patient's unease and bleeding, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the perforation of abscesses that appear under the nipple.
These abscesses that appear under the nipple are a type of scrofula, hard, and containing a sac-like skin.
And some of these contain humidity; and those that contain humidity should be incised with a lunar incision according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then you fill it with old cotton and leave it there until the next day.
Then the cotton should be removed and the area treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes and scrofula, then you incise it as we have said in the section on scrofula.
But if the wound is extensive, so that decay sets in, then administer cautery as we have previously described.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur from archery or a vein.
When an artery is broken and the flesh that is over it is consolidated, then often an abscess occurs. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are from an artery or vein: because when an abscess is from an artery, it is long and deep within the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a sort of whistling sound within it.
And that which is from a vein is round and superficial on the body.
And incision of this abscess is dangerous, especially in that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large, therefore its treatment with iron should be avoided.  And that which is in the extremities, or on the head, should also be avoided [or,  the incision should be avoided].
But concerning that which is caused by inflammation of the opening of the artery, make a long incision in the flesh; and then widen the incision with forceps and approach the artery, and free it from the tissues until it is exposed.
And then place a needle on it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with double thread in two places—the method of which I have shown you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
And then puncture the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood which is there comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment in which powder is generated until the ligaments fall away; and then treat it with ointments suitable for this until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess caused by a severed vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can with the flesh, and then insert the needle below the place which you have held under your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be double thread on it so that you extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with good thread, as I have told you in the tying of the uvula4 in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread will pull out, then insert the thread with that needle under all the abscess below the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until, when what is in it has come out, then you incise the superfluity of the flesh, and leave what is tied in it.
Then place on it a powder which you have submerged in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is done with poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess which happens because of a twisted nerve.
Just as an abscess happens in an artery and in a vein, similarly an abscess happens in the nerves when it happens in their percussion or happens due to excessive work, and similarly.
And it is made worst in the places of the joints or of the heel, or in any place where the joints are weakened.
And the abscess is serious, and is similar in color to the other body parts, and is in the worst dispositions of them and when it is squeezed with force, the patient feels a kind of numbness.
And the abscess is not aggravated in the front of the body, and therefore it is below the ribs, and it is weakened in every part and does not go to the front or back parts.
Therefore, that which is in the joints should not be invaded with iron, for contraction will very quickly result.
But that which is in the head or on the forehead, treat with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps and cut it away from the root.
And if it is large, then you should lift it with a hook, and flay it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which happens in the area which happens in the abdomen.
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, those things which are called funguses by similarity to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and sometimes the lips of these are inverted, and sometimes they are small, and sometimes they are very large.
And I have already seen one, and in his belly were two such things which were more similar to fungi, and there was no difference between them, white, with a thin root.
And sometimes the lips of these were inverted and split open, and humidity flowed from them constantly.
Therefore I incised them and found in one about eighteen ounces, and in the other about six ounces.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you consider then if the patient is humid, and the color of the swelling is white, humid, with a subtle root; then you incise it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries in the fire at your hand, because many times after the incision of it much blood is expelled; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take freshly made lead plaster, and bind the swelling with it, in the manner which we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to tighten the lead greatly on the swelling, until it is cut off and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the swelling is of thick root, then in the incision of it there is some cause for fear and dread, and especially that which is in the belly.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And then care for it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to incise a swelling which is of dark color, little feeling, and of slow growth, for that is likely cancerous.
And I come with the reminder of cancer concerning this.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the treatment of umbilical hernia.
Umbilical hernia is caused by many things; either by fissures of the diaphragm which is above the belly, and through it the intestine or bowel protrudes as it does in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or by constricted wind within it.
But if it is due to a fissure of the diaphragm and protrusion of the intestine, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the bowel, then its location is as we have recounted, of greater and more varied intensity, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and readily returns; and it is easily felt there, and is greatly increased by the entry of a bath and strenuous exertion.
But if due to humidity, then it is soft and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it grow.
And if it is due to blood, then the swelling appears with these signs, tending towards blackness.
But if it is due to raw flesh, then the swelling is heavy, large and hard, and is fixed in one place.
But if it is due to wind/gas, then the touch of it is soft.
And the operation on it is that you consider then if the swelling of the umbilicus is from arterial blood, or venous blood, or from wind/gas; then it is fitting that you are forbidden from the treatment of it, because in that there is fear and dread, just as I have taught you in the chapter in which I discussed swellings from artery and from vein.
And if the swelling of the umbilicus is from the intestine or from the membrane, then it is fitting that you command the patient to hold his breath, and be lying down extended; and then mark with a probe around the whole umbilicus, and then command him to lie between your hands upon his back, and then surround with a broad spatula around the umbilicus over the area which you have marked with the probe; and then extend half of the swelling towards the upper parts with a large inch; and then bind around with strong thread or with a bandage, and in a proper manner of binding.
And then open the middle of the extended swelling over the bandage and introduce your finger into that opening and search for the intestine; and if you have found it and held it by the bandage, then you carefully extract and push the intestine back into the interior parts of the belly.
And if you have found the membrane, then take that with forceps; and incise its superfluities.
But if it is contrary to your [expectation of finding only] artery or vein, then surround that area, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and put in those two strong threads and insert two needles in the circle which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate; and then tighten the swelling in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the extended flesh dries and falls off by itself; or incise that when it is thinned and has dried, and then cure that with whatever ointments are necessary until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the navel is of raw flesh there or from humidity, then it is necessary that you concavate the swelling as we have said and extract the blood or the humidity, which you find there, and then cure that with what is necessary and that consolidates the area.
Chapter 53.
Concerning the treatment of cancer.
We have already said, in the division, of the type of cancer and in what manner there is a way to its cure with medicines, and that it is to be avoided in it the cure with iron so that it is not ulcerated; and we have said of cancer generated in the mother and caution in its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, as is the cancer which is in the breasts or in the thigh and in similar parts of the body, to extract all of that, and especially when it is small and beginning.
But when it is old and large, it is not advisable to apply oneself to it, for I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen another, nor that it has been achieved.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you proceed and let the patient bleed and purge of black bile sometimes, and then bleed him, if a manifest repletion is found.
And then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is positioned for the operation, and then apply to the wound ointments which are suitable for it; and then hollow out on all sides with the curved knife, carefully, until no part of its roots remains. And let the blood flow, and do not staunch it lightly, and press the areas, and wipe away the thick blood all with your hand or with an instrument with which it is possible for you among the instruments.
But if you find an excessive flow of thick blood from an incision of a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood is stopped, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 44.  (Assuming a standard chapter numbering system)
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy from water, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites, and iron is not applied to the species of tympanites or to the species of anasarca, for that is mortal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanitic dropsy with medicines and your treatment is not effective, then consider, for if the patient has already developed debility, or has another illness in addition to this dropsy, such as a cough or abdominal pain and similar conditions, then be careful not to treat with iron, for there is danger in that.
But if you see the patient with exuberant strength, and with no other illness but dropsy alone, and neither a child nor an old person, then the manner of operating on him is that you raise the patient between your hands, and the assistant gently presses his abdomen with his hand, driving the water towards the area below the pubic bone, and then take a lancet in this way:
Let it be of two sharp edges, long, with a sharp point like a lancet; but however, let there be some shortness in it, little by little, so that in operating with it you do not penetrate the intestine, and injure it.
And then consider if the generation of the dropsy is from the intestines, for then it is necessary that you, with the incision, distance yourself from the navel by the amount of three fingers towards the lower parts, to the right of it, above the pubic bone.
But if the generation of the dropsy is due to illness of the liver, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then your incision should be on the right.
And it is not fitting that your incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, lest the superfluities flow to that weak place.
And then perforate the entire abdomen with the instrument, and then insert it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the abdomen and the peritoneum, and you will scrape that; and if [it is] the quantity of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then perforate the peritoneum until the spatula reaches the empty place, which is the location of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or bronze or tinned lead, which at its lowest part has a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its incised extremity is shaped like a feather, thus:
And at its uppermost extremity is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately settles on the instrument, therefore evacuating the water in a half-hour quantity, because if you evacuate more than is necessary at the time, the patient very quickly dies from the dissolution of their animal spirit, or a syncope occurs which is close to death.
But evacuate according to the quantity of its virtue and according to what the patient's disposition signifies to you, the virtue of their pulse, and their well-being.
And then extract the instrument, and retain the water, the reason being that it is immediately retained by the chain which closes the hole that is on the cup, of which I have recounted to you that you should pierce it in that manner.
And then repeat the procedure with the instrument on another day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for several days cautiously, and guard against error so that little water remains.
But if you fear for the patient, and leave a large quantity of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and induce sweating in a bath, and expose him to the sun for a long time; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, the spleen, and the liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.
Chapter 55.
Concerning the treatment of children born with imperforate urinary tracts.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urethra is not perforated (or is narrow or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with perforation as soon as it is born, using a very fine instrument, according to this method:
And then place a thin lead probe into the opening and leave it there for three or four days.
And when it wants to urinate, it should be stimulated, and it will urinate; and then return the probe.
And if you do not place the lead [probe], it is possible that the urine which goes to that place will not allow it to close.
But that which has a narrow opening should be treated with a lead probe, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, it is said, the cause is that in those who are born with the opening below the tip of the penis, so that they cannot urinate into the appropriate vessels until they lift the penis with their hand to a higher position; and it is not conducive to generation, because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line, and it is a very long-lasting illness.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient should be placed on his back, and then extend the tip of his penis with your left hand with forceful traction, and incise the tip of the penis at the location of the prepuce with a sharp scalpel, like a feather incision, or you should not cut any part, so that the middle of it comes to resemble the head of the penis and that the opening falls into the middle place as it should.
And be careful in your operation about the flow of blood, for this often happens; and stop the bleeding with something appropriate, and take care of the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Concerning balanitis, which occurs in the prepuce at the head of the penis, and of corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis.
This balanitis often occurs on the penis and is a fleshy swelling.
And of that, one is malignant and the other is non-malignant.
For the non-malignant type, you should suspend it with a fine thread and excise it until you have removed it all; then place on it a pledget soaked in Egyptian ointment; and after that, treat it with diachylon ointment until it is healed.
And if the balanitis is malignant, with a dark color, then you should apply cautery near its incision and its root.
But if the balanitis is in the prepuce of the glans penis of an uncircumcised man, and one part of the balanitis is inside the prepuce and the other part is outside, then you should remove the balanitis that is inside first, until it is consolidated; and then you treat the outside part, because if you treat both together, the prepuce might be damaged.
And if you find in the genitals and prepuce blackness and corruption, then you should remove everything that is already blackened and that is beginning to corrupt or is already corrupt; and then apply to that area honey, which has been mixed with crushed and sifted pomegranate rind flour and finely sifted crumbs.
And then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply lunar cautery according to this method:
because cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, that is to say, for bleeding and for the wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you should insert a lead cannula into the meatus of the prepuce so that the patient urinates through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis (and this adhesion does not happen except in one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision has not been performed on him; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess) it is necessary that you scrape with a blunt spatula until the adhesion is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate these carefully, then you should scrape with a spatula some part of the head of the penis and of the prepuce, and this is because the prepuce, when it is thin, is very easily perforated by its slight thinness.
Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a very thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then let it be treated with astringent wine until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Of the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to those circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is of our operation and our will, and it is especially performed on infants, it is necessary that we assign to it the best operation and the easiest path leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not discuss circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience, which is why I have found most of the artisans and barbers use circumcision and cleansing with a lancet and with tow; and they use ligature with thread and incision with the fingernail.
And I have tried all these methods and I find no better cleansing with scissors, with ligature with thread than cleansing with the fingernail, because many times the skin peels off from above, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is easily forced to another incision and certain pain. And with cleansing which is done by scraping, and is digital, which shoemakers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not safe, because it easily enters its hole.
But in the operation with a fingernail, it easily becomes rusty and corrupts your operation. And the foreskin of a child is short by nature, and many times it is born in such a way that it has no need of cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with scissors and ligatures with thread, the goodness, experience reveals to me, because scissors are for proportional incision, because the sharpness that is above is the same as the sharpness that is below; and therefore as you place your hand, two sharpnesses are proportional, and you incise according to a comparison at one time; and compression is made by the thread in a manner that contains the foreskin of the penis in every part, with which no error at all is made.
And the method of the first operation is that you make the child lie down, especially if he is among those who understand a little, that you do nothing but tie the thread on his penis only, and that you leave it until the next day.
And then make him happy in every way possible that he can understand. And then make him lie still between your hands, prepared and not at all moving; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them or any other of the instruments.
And then place your hand on his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it until the glans penis is exposed, and then clean it of any dirt that is attached to it.
The shape of the scissors for circumcision, this is the shape:
Let one end be blunt and the other sharp, so that the nail does not come out, and let the length of the two points be the same as the length of two fingers joined together.
But the error in circumcision is that you too quickly remove the entire foreskin, or part of it, below the incision.
Therefore it is necessary that you extend that [foreskin] with your fingernail before the suppuration of the area and that you incise it evenly.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with forceps and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and what is swollen remains under the infected penis, then you leave it until the hot abscess subsides, and carefully scrape it, and incise it as you see fit.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for this will harm him.
And then treat it with that which consolidates the wound, from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised excessively from the scrotum and affects the parts above, this will not harm him.
And moreover, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
On the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from a stone, or by congealed blood, or by pus, or by a tumor, and similar to those [causes] of which we have spoken of the methods of treatment in the division [of this text].
And if it is not dissolved by what we have said, and the condition is severe in the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver and be subtly hollowed like a bird's quill, with the subtlety of a long ray, similar to a palm and a half in length, to which a fine tube is attached to its head.
And the manner of drawing out the urine by this means is that you take a doubled linen cloth and tie wool or cotton to its end with a good knot; and insert the ends of the cloth into the part below the syringe, and cut with scissors if any excess wool is present, but insert it into the cannula with force. Then lubricate the syringe with butter and egg white.
And make the patient sit on a stool, and rub their bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and rose water.
Then gently insert the syringe until it reaches the root of the penis; and then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; and then push the syringe inside that; and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient know that it has reached the empty space, and this is not done according to this order, but the meatus where it goes is tortuous.
Then slowly extend the cloth with the wool, because the urine will soak the wool.
Then extract that and use it for urine treatment, and use a syringe; do not cease doing this and using the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Of the quality of bladder irrigation with a catheter and with similar instruments which are suitable for this.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or blood clots in it, or putrefaction is constricted there, and you wish to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument which is called a catheter, and this is its form:
except that its extremity is blunt, that is, closed. And in it are three holes: two on one side, thus arranged.
At the beginning is a concave space, in which is what is pushed in, and let it be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, except that when some matter is drawn from the humors with it, it is drawn out, and when it is expelled, it is drawn out with it, and when it is expelled long, as the catheter does with which naphtha is inserted in sea battles.
Therefore, when you wish to draw out humors from the bladder, insert the tip of the catheter into the humor, and draw with it that which is pushed up to the upper parts, because the humor is drawn into the concavity of the catheter.
And then insert the tip of the catheter into the urethra as we have recounted in the syringe; and then push the humor with what you push, because that humor arrives at the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
The shape of the fine catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is its shape:
And let it be made of silver or brass, of which the upper end should be similar to a small feather, and below it a straight tube.
And then take a goat's bladder, and place in it the humor that you wish to catheterize into the bladder, and then tie it between two with a strong double ligature, and heat that humor over the fire.
And then insert the tip of the catheter into the penis (or urethra).
And then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid with gentle pressure until the patient says that the liquid has already reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and perforate it all around its circumference; and then insert strong thread into those holes, so that it is tightly bound; and then prepare the circle as it is prepared for the *alsofatur* (presumably a type of instrument or vessel), after you have placed in it what you wish of the humors, oils, and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with that as you have done with the bladder, and express it with your hand until the humidity reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and their signs.
And we have discussed the stone in which one operates by hand and incision.
And the stone generated in the bladder properly is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that stones generated in the bladder mostly affect children; and among its signs is that the urine that is expelled from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient feels a burning sensation in his urethra, and often has pain, and is frequently urged to urinate; and with this, he expels a lot of this sand.
And the healing of children from this is easy until they reach fourteen years of age; and the cure is difficult in the elderly. But in young people it is moderate because it is between those extremes.
And of that in which the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.
Therefore, to arrive at the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning that we purify the patient with a clyster which removes all the impurities that are in his bowels; for this impurity sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone through its examination.
And then let the patient be taken with his feet up and be massaged and manipulated downwards so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it may sometimes leap from its place.
And then make that [patient's body] lean between your hands, prepared in such a way that his hands are below his thighs, so that the entire bladder is made to incline downwards.
And then search for it and remove all of it from there.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space [bladder], then you must immediately take care of it with an incision.
And if it does not entirely descend with your touch, then it is necessary that you anoint your index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is a fully grown youth, and insert it into his anus. And search for the stone until it is below your finger. And bring it back little by little into the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards towards the place where you will make the incision.
And instruct the assistant to press on the bladder with her hand; and instruct another assistant to extend the genitals upwards with her right hand, and with her other hand to hold back the perineum which is below the genitals, at the location where the incision is to be made.
And then introduce a well-sharpened spatula, of which this is the form: and cut what is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be above that stone, and your finger in the anus, and let a transverse incision be made, so that the external incision is wide and the internal narrow, according to the size that the extraction of the stone allows, and no larger, for you will quickly compress with your finger, which is in the anus, the stone against the incision, and it will be expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones are angular and rough, which makes their removal difficult because of this.
And those that are like an acorn, and are round, are easily removed.
Therefore, if it is one that is angular and rough, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not expelled in this way, then you must press on it, or squeeze it with a suitably shaped instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you press on the stone, and it does not escape; or introduce a slender instrument with a curved end underneath it.
But if you cannot reach it, then widen the opening slightly, and if you see a flow of blood, staunch it with crushed vitriol.
But if there is more than one stone, then initially you should place your hand at the opening of the bladder, and then incise it; and then push a little more; and similarly do if there are several more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is unwise to incise it with a large incision, for two things may happen to the patient: either death, or a continuous dripping of urine, because the area is not completely healed.
But administer its expulsion until it is removed, or work on breaking it with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Then, when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with aloe shavings and dragon's blood, and bind it. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be calmed.
Then lay the patient on their back, and do not unbind the bandage until the third day.
And when you have unbound it, bathe the area with water and plenty of oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if a hot, burnt, and corrosive abscess occurs in the wound, and it resembles blood frozen in the bladder, and urine is thereby prevented (and this is known by the passage of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it provokes corruption of the bladder and putrefaction thereof.
Then wash the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and apply, according to the type, whatever is suitable for its healing until it is cured.
And it is necessary during the entire treatment that you bind both thighs and apply the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the meatus of the penis, and is lodged there, and the flow of urine is obstructed, then treat it with what I have recommended before you resort to incision, for many times through this treatment incision is avoided; and I have proven this, and that is that you take a sharp iron perforator, of which this is the form:
of triangular, sharp, outward-extending end, fixed in a shaft.
Then take bile, and bind the penis with it below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the iron into the penis, perforating easily until the perforator reaches the stone. And rotate the perforator with your hand against that stone little by little, and you will widen the perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side; for the urine will immediately be released.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outside of the penis, because that is fragmented, and it is expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not suitable for you due to any reason that prohibits it, then bind one bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. Then make an incision on the stone in that penis between the two bandages. And then extract it. Then untie the bandages and clean the congealed blood which is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to bandage below the stone except so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other bandage above, because when the bandage is untied near the extraction of the stone, the stone returns to its place and closes the wound.
And for that reason it is necessary for you, when you bandage above, that you raise the stone to the upper parts, or that it return through your efforts, and the wound closes as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of stones from women.
Stones are rarely generated in women.
But if a stone appears in any of them, then its cure is difficult, and is prohibited in many ways.
One reason is that a woman is very easily a virgin (meaning, easily made a virgin again, i.e., her hymen could easily re-form or the reference is to the chastity of women generally).
And the second is that you will not find a woman, whether chaste or married, who willingly reveals herself to a physician.
The third is that you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision for a stone in women is far from the location of the stone itself, requiring a deep incision, and there is danger in that.
But if necessity compels you to this, then you must take a female physician who is skilled, and few such are found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a cautious and subtle male physician, or present a matron well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who has some knowledge in this art.
Therefore, have that person present, and command them to do everything you order, beginning with the examination for the stone; the reason for this is that if you need to check if the woman is a virgin, then it is necessary to insert one's finger into her rectum and seek out the stone.
Then, if you find it, grasp it under your finger, and then order that an incision be made upon it.
But if she is not a virgin, then order the matron to insert her finger into the vagina of the patient and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and compressing it with good pressure.
Then, if she finds it, it is necessary to gently draw it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts using the force of her hand until it reaches the root of the thing.
And then incise it near the place where half of the vagina meets the root of the thing, wherever it is lodged, and center the stone in that part, and your finger should not be removed from the stone while grasping it from below.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert the probe into that incision, and if you feel the stone, then adjust the incision according to the size that you know the stone to be, so that it may be extracted.
And know that there are many kinds of stones: for some are small and large, and smooth and rough, and long and round, and having branches (or protrusions).
Therefore, you should know how many types there are of them, so that you can signify what you desire.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the place and hold it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
And ensure that you prepare with you the instruments which are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you are aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which is incised, then you should put powder on the place and bind it tightly with powders and a descending bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will quickly die. And then treat the wound.
Then, when the sharpness of the bleeding has subsided after a few days, and the place has healed, then you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62.
Concerning the incision of a strangulated hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of humidity in the white tunic which is below the skin of the genitals, containing the testicle, and is called the tunic.
And sometimes it is in the proper tunic which nature prepared for it in the part of the testicle, so that it seems that there is another testicle; and it is the skin of the genital between the white tunic which we have mentioned, and this is nothing but a swelling.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the genitals, so that this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it happens due to a blow inflicted on the genitals.
And this humidity has many colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or bloody, or reddish, or black and foul-smelling, or watery white, and this is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white tunic which we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, inclining slightly to length like the shape of an egg, and it surrounds the testicle, for the humidity contains it on all sides.
And if the humidity is in the proper tunic, then the abscess is round in the part of the testicle and therefore one believes it to be another testicle.
And if the humidity is between the sheath of the genitals and the white tunic, then it falls below the feeling/sensation.
And if you want to know the color of the humidity, then you probe the color of the humidity in the abscess with a probe, whose shape precedes; and according to that which has come out on the probe, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we come to its cure with iron, then it is necessary that we order the patient to be bled if that is possible for you, and fill his body.
And then let him lie supine on his back on something slightly raised, and place many cloths underneath him.
And then sit on his left side, and command the assistant to be on his right, who should extend his finger to one of the two sides to the sheath of the genitals and the part of the navel of the belly.
And then take a broad spatula and split the sheath of the genitals in the middle lengthwise almost to the pubic bone.
And let the incision be made straight, equally distant from the line that divides the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the included white fatty tissue.
And scrape that [fatty tissue], and observe, and be careful not to cut that; and your scraping with which you scrape it, let it be done gently, and  carefully examine with the scraping as much as is possible for you.
And then pierce the water-filled cyst with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the cyst upwards; and do not touch the sheath of the genitals, and incise the cyst in the way that is possible for you. And incise it in its entirety or in pieces, and especially its thin layer, for if you do not carefully examine its incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the egg [testicle] protrudes from its sheath during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the cyst, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the sheath of the genitals with suture, and then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another disease, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are on the spermatic cord, and remove the testicle, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the fluid is collected in two separate parts, then know that there are two hernias; therefore, incise that part in the same way as you did the other; and if it seems to you that it is a single operation, then you perform it.
And then you wipe away the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place on top more wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread this over the genitals and the pubic area; and place over it folded cloths and powders, and bind them over with a bandage which is according to this form:
And then two cloths should be taken and filled with carded wool in this manner; and the ends should be made with which it is pressed with cotton or damp wool, and they should be attached with a structure in the waistband of the breeches, and one of the ends should reach from the buttocks to the groin, and the second should reach to the part of the scrotum, and two ends on the two thighs and two other ends on the two knees, and the whole structure should be fastened in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with an iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery and that you incise with it the skin of the genitals, and it is ignited as we have described until the white pus containing the water is exposed, and then you take a cautery of this form: and it resembles the Greek letter.
And then perforate the abscess with it, and ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then extend the abscess with tweezers, and scrape with tweezers, and scrape with a thin, ignited cautery; and incise it as much as you can until you eradicate all of it; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg (presumably referring to the testicle).
And know that this operation is safer and less prone to bleeding, and better than an operation with incision.
But if an abscess causes you difficulty during incision or cauterization, or bleeding, then you must treat whatever difficulty it causes you, with the treatment that is appropriate to it, as described.
But if the patient is fearful and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I have recommended; and this is when you are certain, because of what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is watery.
Then you should have the patient sit on some raised seat, then perforate the abscess at its lowest part with a broad spatula, and position the perforation according to the length of the body (presumably the length of the abscess).
And let the opening be wide enough so that all the water drains out.
Then place a cotton dressing over the area and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water drains out. And then care for it until the wound is healed.
But if there is an obstruction to the drainage of the water, then you should perforate it. This is done only because the white panniculus (fatty layer) at the opening of the wound obstructs and prevents the exit of the water. Then you should put into the wound a probe or instrument with which the water is extracted from dropsies, the shape of which is described earlier; or apply a small incision to the opening of the wound.
And know that the water will return, and it will be added again in about six months or thereabouts; and when it is accumulated, then it should be perforated in the same manner, for thus the patient will spend his days.
Chapter 63.
Concerning the incision of a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is a danger leading to death in most cases; therefore, in my opinion, its removal and being saved by this method is preferable.
And I am recalling the operation in this case and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the genitals, which are composed thus, and this is caused by many things: either by an acute, acrid superfluity, which is poured into the genitals, or by percussion.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And very quickly is a stone-like abscess formed, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by a knotting of the arteries, and by the inflammation of these, as is perceived by the recollection of it, or by inflammation of the veins.
But that which is from inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when we compress it with our fingers; and it is not necessary that one touch it.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any means from compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision be made on this type of [abscess/swelling] and on the other flesh; and it is that you incise the skin of the genitals, and then stretch the testicle upwards, and extract it from the white sheath, and free the suspensory ligament, and tie it, and incise the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from all parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already consolidated with those inflamed tissues, then it is necessary that you extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between some part of the sheath, or between that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh at the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you incise all that which is there, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of a hernia which is of the scrotum (or groin).
A scrotal hernia is an abscess enveloped by a certain covering similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles, and it makes exercise and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, fear is involved,  because of what precedes its recollection (or because of what is remembered preceding it;  the meaning is somewhat ambiguous and depends on the exact intended meaning of "rememoracio").
However, it is necessary that we describe the operation on it according to how the first (doctors/surgeons) did it.
And I say that it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised chair; and then pull up the suspensory of the testicles towards the lower parts; and then hold the scrotum with your fingers along with the vessels that are felt on the penis; and let another assistant hold those, and extend them with strong extension.
And then incise with a wide, sharp scalpel with a transverse incision to the right of the vessels until the vessels are uncovered.
And then scrape the entire area, just as we have told you in the extraction of arrowheads which are in the temples.
And then place in those a double-threaded needle, and tie it at the first of the places where you have seen blood, and tie it again at the back of them. And then incise those in the middle with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is accumulated of fetid and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which you want healing to be generated so that the vessels which nourish one of the two genitals fall, for it is not harmful because of that.
But if blood flows from all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be cut off with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they be removed, or that they are cut off so that there is no nourishment to them.
Chapter 65.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture that happens in the peritoneum extended over the abdomen on the side of the groin, so that the intestines protrude from that rupture to some of the intestines.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or an extension of it, and these two types occur for many reasons:  a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting something heavy, or similar.
And the sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and does not occur suddenly, and is a swelling gradually increasing towards the groin because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum, is that at the beginning it causes a sudden, vehement pain; and there is an apparent swelling below the groin, close to the apparent area, and this is because of the protrusion of the intestine, and its body is outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum is expelled along with the intestine, and this hernia is called an intestinal zirbal hernia.  (Note: "zirbal" appears to be a term specific to this text and its meaning requires further context within the treatise.)
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and it is retained there, and this causes great harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of this type of illness, iron is feared, therefore, cauterization should be avoided in this case.
And the method of operating on this is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with their hand to the inside of its cavity if it obeys its return, and then lean over their abdomen between your hands, and raise their legs.
Then hold the scrotum which is the covering of the testicles upwards, and incise the scrotum completely lengthwise; and then insert two hooks into the lips of the incision as needed to keep the incision open with them.
And if, according to the amount that is possible for you, the egg (testicle) can be expelled from that incision.
And then scrape away that layer of skin which is under the scrotum, until the hard white tunic is exposed on each side (of the testicle).
Then you insert your finger into what is the testicle, into what is between the white tunic which is under the covering of the testicle and the second tunic, and break up with it the adhesions that are in the back part of the testicle.
And then gently pull the scrotum outwards with your hand, and with that spread the white tunic upwards with your left hand, and elevate the testicle with the tunic to the edge of the incision; and instruct the assistant to hold the testicle upwards while you dissolve the adhesions that are behind it with a complete solution (of the problem/adhesions).
And search with your fingers that there is no intestine enveloped in the hard white tunic. But if you find any such thing (intestine), then you carefully push it back down into the abdomen.
And then make an incision in the part under the covering of the testicles, through which incision blood and pus will flow, just as we have described above.
And then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature which we have described (and sometimes the white tunic is cauterized, which we mentioned near its incision to stem the flow of blood, because this often happens) and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be bathed with warm water, and keep it there until it falls off as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Concerning a Windy Hernia (or,  Venous Hernia/Hernia with Swelling).
In this type of hernia, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron (cautery).
And the first [doctors] said that it is done as we have recounted in the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision on that [hernia] with ease; and then dry the middle of the place around the abscess with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away/collapse.
And cure the wound according to what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture that is made in the inguinal region (groin).
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and it swells the area.
And do not allow the genitals any cause of the intestines in the genitals; and if they do, it is little; and it returns at all hours. (This likely refers to a hernia and the need to keep the intestines from entering the scrotum.  The phrasing is awkward and perhaps incomplete in the original.)
But if the time with this is prolonged, a fissure is formed in the inguinal canal until the intestine descends into the inguinal canal; and this happens because of the extension of the inguinal canal which is in the groin as we have said, the cause of which is that the canal is stretched, and then it is softened and the place is inflamed and swollen.
And its cure is with cautery, as its description has preceded.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this manner:  the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry the location of the rupture of the swollen abscesses with incision across the width according to the quantity of three fingers.
And then tighten the white inguinal canal that is under the groin until it is uncovered.
And then take the ray (presumably a surgical instrument) and place it on the prominent part of the inguinal canal, and press it towards the abdomen.
And then sew the two prominent locations on the end of the inguinal canal's ray (instrument), and join one to the other with a suture.
And then remove the end of the ray (instrument), and do not incise the inguinal canal completely, nor extend the wound, nor anything else like that as I will let you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat that with the treatment for wounds, and as you incise the fibers, cleanse it and repair the wound until it is consolidated; because the inguinal canal is constricted and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted.
And cautery is better in this location, because it is closer to health (i.e., more likely to promote healing).
Chapter 68.
Concerning the softening of the scrotum.
Many times the scrotum in some men is softened because the flesh that is between them is softened, and this hinders its appearance (i.e., makes it difficult to see properly).
Then it is necessary for the one who is charged with his cure to make the patient lie on his back, and to sew all the softened scrotum onto the natural scrotum; and then to adjust two lips with the suture (i.e., to close the opening with sutures).
And if you wish, sew together at the beginning the excess of the softened scrotum with three or four stitches and with a firm suture.
And then incise between the sutures; and then treat it as you would other wounds until it is healed and the stitches can be removed.
Chapter 69.
Concerning castration.
Know that castration is forbidden by our law, but because of this I am obliged to remember it in this book; and its remembrance is necessary only in two ways: one is so that the physician may know it when questioned about it, so that he knows how to treat what has happened; and the other way is that we often have need of the castration of other animals for our benefit from them, such as mules, goats, pigs, and similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by incision.
But in that which is done by crushing, the method of operation is that we should immerse the animal in warm water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. Then grasp them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear beneath the touch.
But in castration done by incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the scrotum of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament, and incise upon each testicle with a single cut until both testicles are severed.
Then incise them after you have flayed each one. And do not place any substance on those of the cyphus (presumably referring to a surgical instrument or anatomical part), except for the fine cyphus which is over the vessels.
And this manner of castration is better which is done by crushing, because crushing quickly leaves no part of the testicles remaining, so that the animal desires no more copulation.
Then care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Concerning the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is of two kinds: one is where there appears in the space of the scrotum, that which is between the two testicles, a form like a woman's vulva in which there is hair.
And sometimes urine flows from that which is in the scrotum.
But in women there is one type: and it is that the vulva of the woman above the mons pubis is like two testicles of a man, somewhat smaller, externally resembling the foreskin of a man and two testicles.
And the cure is of three types: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you incise those tightened flesh until the swelling escapes, and then that you cure them with the treatment for other wounds.
And in the second type of men, from which urine flows that is in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation for him.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the swelling and prominent flesh caused by women's ailments.
A slight swelling is often caused by natural reasons until it is squeezed and made light by observation; and sometimes it is magnified in some women to such an extent that it is spread as in men and extends to the genitals.
Then it is necessary that you hold back the excess of swelling with your hand or with a bandage and incisions.
And do not overdo the incisions, especially in the root area, so that bleeding does not occur.
And then treat it with wound care until it is healed.
But a fleshy growth is flesh that grows in the mother's womb until it fills it, and it soon comes out through the external parts resembling a tail (and for this reason some first called this "tailed disease"); therefore, we must incise it as we incise a swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Concerning the treatment of gout.
Gout is when the vagina of the woman is not perforated, or the opening is small. And this is either natural or accidental.
Accidental [gout] is due to a preceding illness, and that is caused either by poorly formed flesh or by a thin or thick membrane.
And it is formed either in the front of the mother, or on the sides of it, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it, and prohibits coitus and conception and childbirth, and strongly inhibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by examining the womb; if the obstruction is apparent, [it is diagnosed]; but if it is not apparent, then you must search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin membrane, and it is close to the two labia, then you should incise and break it.
And you should place powders on the two labia, and then place your index fingers of both hands together [on the labia].
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then spread the two labia forcefully until that thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the area, and keep it moist all day so that the incised area does not close up.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you should incise it with a broad spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to flesh, then suspend it with an ointment, and incise it.
And use with them medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and incense, mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not close too quickly.
And keep it there for a few days and administer some dry lint.
And then it should be treated with another healing method until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the mother's birth of other flesh, and then it is necessary to incise according to this method. (This likely refers to a complication during childbirth). But if this is due to a cancerous abscess, the cancerous abscess which is in the mother should not be treated with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids and boils and red swellings that occur in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are an enlargement of the orifices of many veins, from which much blood continuously flows; and when hemorrhoids are old, boils are formed.
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will say thus which receive treatment and which do not receive treatment.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and boils, when they are in the womb and do not appear externally, then in those cases no treatment should be done with iron (i.e., cautery or surgery).
But those which are at the orifice of the womb, upon which one feels [them], are those which are cured.
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cold place and then extend the boil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them at the roots.
And then sprinkle on them, to stop the flow of blood, one of the incisive powders without biting [properties], such as acacia and similar things.
And then bathe her feet for an hour, and then place them in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of summac and pomegranate bark and oak bark and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with this and apply it to her back.
And if the blood is stopped, it is good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, to the breasts without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or in comfrey juice or in  ivy juice with diluted wine and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of the rectum by accident in the mother.
Many kinds of abscesses happen in the mother, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcerative, and inflamed, and erysipelas, and hemorrhoidal fistulas, and fissures, and boils, and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these illnesses, and their types, and their symptoms, and their treatments in the division [or section].
And it is necessary that I speak in this treatise of a hot abscess which occurs in the mother, when it is one of the abscesses which gathers pus; and if you want to know in what manner the operation is performed on it with iron.
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is acute, with throbbing, and phlegm, and fever, and sometimes redness, and if the feeling is intense; then do not attempt perforation, and treat it with that which aids maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
And then you must make the woman sit on a stool that has two legs; and lean on her side, and adjust her feet to the lowest part of her belly, and her thighs should be spread, and place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage.
And then the midwife follows from the right side and administers the instrument with which the orifice of the womb is opened, the form of which will be described in those things which are done next.
And it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, that you place with the ray the neck of the woman's womb, and that which of the instrument is inserted into the womb should not be more than the neck of the womb and it hurts the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the neck of the womb, then it is necessary that you place powders on the texture of the neck of the womb so that the entry of any instrument into the neck of the womb is prevented.
And it is necessary that you place the vertige (likely referring to a rotating mechanism or a handle) that runs in the instrument on the upper side, and that the person administering it holds the instrument and turns the vertige until the orifice of the womb is opened.
And when the incision appears, and it is touched with the hand and is soft and moist, then it is necessary that you dry that area with a linen cloth around the head.
And when the blood has been evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a wick submerged in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the caul (possibly referring to a membrane or protective covering) on the incision in the neck of the womb.
And place outside the womb and on the vulva clean wool submerged in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And afterwards it should be treated for about two days with an ointment which is suitable for this, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed in such a way that it is rinsed with water and honey, and afterwards with water in which the root of lily or of birthwort has been boiled, and afterwards it returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep inside the womb, then you must be forbidden from treating it with iron, taking care with that in accordance with what we have said in the division (presumably a previous section of the treatise).
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives in what manner live embryos should be treated when they are expelled in an unnatural way (or form).
It is necessary that the midwife know at the beginning the characteristics of a natural childbirth, and it is that when you see the woman strain in her lower parts and desire to smell the air, and on top of that is lightened by that which is upon her of the birth, and hastens the exit of the embryo, then you should know that this birth is according to the natural form, and it is the exit of the child head-first, and the afterbirth with it, either suspended or hanging from the umbilicus.
Therefore, when you see those signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends easily, for when it descends head-first, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with good cleansing.
But that which is other than this birth is unnatural and unfavorable, for when the embryo is expelled feet-first and its body is expelled before its head and feet, and one of its hands, or its foot, or its head and hand, or its belly, and very quickly it is turned on its neck, and similar to those unfavorable positions.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skillful in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of those [births], and what skill is required in them so that it may be understood and acted upon.
When the fetus is expelled head-first by natural effort, and this is strenuous for the woman and the birth is difficult, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then have her sit, or have the women support her, and evaporate her vulva with cooked fenugreek and warm oils.
Then the midwife inserts a small, flat spatula between her labia and with it cuts the secundina (afterbirth), or scrapes it with her fingernail until it is free of moisture. And press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman should be given an enema of mallow and fenugreek poultices with a syringe.
Then instruct her, during the enema, to be compressed and make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
And if both hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you must gently reduce them little by little. But if it does not obey the introduction, then place the woman on a stool and raise her legs, and then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the shaking.
And if the hands are not returned inside and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remains of the fetus, or tie the body to its hand with a cloth and extract it evenly, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus comes out feet first, then you must push it upwards, and gently turn the fetus, and then grasp it, and then take one foot and extend it little by little.
But when it has come out between the thighs, then you command her to strain, and make her sneeze with a decoction, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it in its natural position, for then it will be expelled with ease.
And if it is obstructed despite all that we have recommended, then take mallow and dissolved gum mucilage, and pound everything well in a mortar, and then anoint the woman's vulva and the lower part of her belly with this. And then make her bathe in lukewarm water, up to the hypochondria (region below the ribs).
And when you see that the lower parts are softened, then give her a fumigation of myrtle and apply it to her. And when she has had the fumigation for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and then make her sneeze and hold her mouth shut, and remove this [fumigation], and press the lower part of her belly with gentle compression, for the fetus will then be expelled immediately.
Thus [you deliver] the fetus lying sideways, supporting it with one of your hands. Be skillful in reducing [the dislocation] with your hand; but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her hips with vigorous shaking, and then administer bandages which I have recommended made of mucilage.
And if labor has begun, then make her sit on a stool, and then work on reducing [the dislocation] of the hand, and grasp the fetus according to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and command her to strain until it is expelled.
Thus [deliver] the fetus over the cervix, spreading your hands, and its face is towards its mother. Let the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and then rotate it little by little, and thus [the delivery will be] facilitated.
And when it is grasped, then place on the cervix that which we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then instruct her to strain little by little, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a stool and instruct her to lean on her right side, and then instruct her to bear down; and make her sneeze with a concoction [or medicine]. The prepared fetus exits on its side.
When the mother's horror subsides according to this manner, consider, and then you incise the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of its moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended by its face and neck, then you incise it at the umbilicus, so that it may not be retained and die.
And then push the fetus towards the inner parts until you place it as needed, and tell the woman to push herself a few times, and it will be expelled easily in this way, if God wills it.
The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four, but this is rare and happens late; but there are causes of this in nature, and they do not live.
And although they are multiplied, they share one placenta, and are separated by a membrane, distinguishing them within the umbilical ligament of each one. And sometimes they are expelled as one fetus by easy natural delivery, and sometimes they are expelled by difficult delivery as we have recounted.
And if some of their births are difficult and reach the point of those unnatural presentations we have mentioned, then you should treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and skill, and with patience, and is ingenious according to every presentation, as she is prepared by her skill leading to health.
Concerning that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even ten or more are formed in the mother.  And it has been verified by me that one woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten, all formed. This is established by the measurement of the glorious wise men.
And all this must be within the knowledge of the midwife, because it easily appears similar to her, and therefore she must oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat a dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medication, and it has not yet been expelled, and you are forced to use a manual operation, then you must consider whether the woman is of sound constitution and is not afflicted by any of the conditions that endanger her life.
Then the woman should be positioned on the bed on her back, with her head inclined downwards and her thighs raised.
And the assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you moisten the mother's vulva with warm oils and a mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then let the midwife anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the location where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus.
And convenient places for this: then you consider if the fetus is positioned so that it descends head first, and then you grasp the umbilical cord at its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or at its clavicle, or in the appropriate places on the shoulders, or under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is feet first, then at the groin, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary to hold the umbilical cord with the right hand, and place its curve in the space between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and place the cord in one of those places which we have mentioned, until the evacuation is complete.
And then place and add another umbilical cord, or a third if necessary, so that there is equal traction, and it is not extended only in a straight line.
Rather, it should be moved in all directions, so that its exit is facilitated, as is done in the extraction of a tooth.
And it is necessary that what is between them be mollified; and if any part of it is retained, then the midwife should lubricate some of her fingers with oil and expertly insert them and loosen what is retained.
Therefore, if part of the fetus is expelled, then the umbilical cords should be moved to a higher position; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
But if one hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then extract it until it is entirely expelled, and incise it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus you should proceed with the other hand and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or there is constriction during its exit, or there is accumulated water on its head, then it is necessary to insert a spatulate and pointed instrument between the fingers and split the head and extract the water, or to break it with an instrument called an "alundat," the form of which will be shown with the forms of other instruments in the chapter which follows this one.
And similarly proceed if the fetus has a naturally large head: and then it is necessary to incise it with a scalpel, or to grasp it with the alundat as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is out but constricted by the clavicle (furcula), then it should be split until the fluid which is in the feet is discharged.
But if it is not complicated, nor does it obey the attempt at extraction, then you should incise the head immediately as much as is possible for you.
And if the abdomen of the fetus is abscessed or dropsical, then it is necessary that you perforate it until the fluid within it runs out.
But if the fetus is feet-first, then its extraction is easier, and its direction to the mother's birth canal is easy.
But if it is constricted around the belly and feet, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you will have wrapped around your hand, and that you incise the belly and feet until that which is within them flows out.
But if the other limbs are obstructed and the head is turned back, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's birth canal is open, then she inserts her hand into the womb, and searches with it for the head, and draws it with her fingers to the mother's birth canal, and then inserts one or two fingers into it, and pulls it with them.
And if the mother's birth canal is constricted by a hot abscess which harms her, then it should not be disturbed; instead, it is necessary to administer a perfusion of moist, oily substances. And apply plasters; and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then, if possible, it should be rotated; and what we have said should be administered in the case of a live fetus.
And if that is not possible, then let it be cut into pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that no part of the afterbirth be left inside.
And when you have completed all your work, then administer what we have said concerning the treatment of the hot abscesses which may occur in the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then bathe in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb was a dead fetus, and soon after that fire [i.e., pregnancy] again she became pregnant, and soon after that fire [pregnancy], the fetus died again. It happened to him that for a long time there was an abscess in his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and it began to discharge pus.
And I was called to his care, and I treated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied to him plasters of strong attraction for some causes, and I extracted a bone from him, and after a few days, I extracted another bone; and I was very amazed, since there should not be bones in the belly.
And then I considered that they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I cleansed the wound, and extracted many bones from him, the woman being in good condition, and he lived in this way for a long time, discharging a little pus.
And I did not consider this strange, but because in this there is science and help in that the skilled physician administers healing with the hand.
Of the forms of instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of incision by which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a constrictor in which the bandages are tied, to which tying there are two incisions at the two extremities of two poles/rods. However, this incision should be more subtle than a constrictor, and be made of ivory or boxwood.
And let the width of each rod be about two fingers, and the thickness of each about one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle space between the two rods are two fittings of the same wood which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that it is opened with them when you rotate the two prescribed incisions.
Another similar form to that one, but more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of ivory or boxwood, similar in appearance to forceps. However, at its extremity are two additions, just as you see, and the length of these additions is about a palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with them, then you make the woman lie on the bed with her legs hanging down, having opened what is between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, just as you do with scissors, evenly, according to the amount you want to dilate the opening of the mother's womb until the midwife does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
Form of the impellent by which the fetus is expelled:
Form of the hindrance by which the large head is held back.  (The "2" likely indicates a superscript or annotation in the original text, perhaps clarifying the word "amisidat" or referring to a specific type of hindrance.)
And it resembles forceps which have teeth at the end, like a saw, and sometimes it is made long like forceps, according to this form, like a saw, which has teeth like saw teeth with which it is incised and held back. Form of slight hindrance:
Form of a hook having a spine/spike:
Form of a hook having two spines/spikes:
Form of a spatula having two ends/extremities with which the head is severed/cut.
Form of two broad spatulas.
All those instruments are exercised, and when the types of these are multiplied and prepared by the artisans, it is easier in its operation and more valuable to men because of its quantity/number.
And do not neglect those instruments, whatever they may be, that you have prepared, for the necessity of those is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a concoction, and press your hand over her mouth and nostrils, and if by this it is expelled, it is good.
And if not, then you take a pot and pierce a hole in its lid and place herbs in it, opening the mother's mouth, such as  mallow, rue, anise, chamomile, Arabic gum, cassia lignea, and centaury. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the pot, and place that over the fire.
Then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's womb.
Then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and it is not expelled, then you instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or mallow poultice, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it; and when it is found, then take it and remove it little by little. But if it is attached to the womb's walls, then insert her hand as we have instructed, and when she has found the afterbirth, extract it little by little as instructed, so that the mother does not collapse from a violent pull. Furthermore, it should be turned easily to the right and left sides.
And if the mother's mouth (cervix) is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and herbal oil medication.
But if it is not expelled by all the means we have recommended, then be careful not to tire yourself with repeated attempts at extraction. However, what has come out from her into the mother's mouth (cervix) should be left attached to the woman’s vulva, and then cauterize it with ointment and tetrafarmacum; for that will cause it to rot over a few days and it will be dissolved and expelled.
But when it rots, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then appropriate fumigations should be administered.
But some of the Ancients already tested fumigation with hellebore and dried figs.
Method for the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of menstrual blood and afterbirth:
Let it be made of glass or bronze.
And let the thin end be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigating substance placed on the embers of the fire.
And let her hold that inside until that fumigating substance is consumed and then another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus in a child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which are very narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that narrow passage with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
And then place on it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And if anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then it should be treated with what we have said about the treatment and the lead [presumably referring to lead-based ointments].
Concerning the treatment of fistulas that develop below [presumably referring to fistulas in the anal or perineal region].
The fistulas that develop in the lowest part below are knots and thickenings which develop near the anus externally or in the space between the buttocks.
And it is one fistula or several.
And as that knot is old and discharges a watery white humidity or subtle pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known because of what comes out of them through discharge and by flatulence; and sometimes the patient suffers from discharge, and worms easily come out of them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the space between the buttocks, into the bladder, and into the urethra; and some penetrate into the hip joint and into the buttock.
And the way to distinguish between a fistula that penetrates into the anus and one that does not, is to insert your finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe of brass or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair against your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all, nor does anything come from the opening—neither discharge, nor worms, nor flatulence, as we have said—then know that it is non-penetrating, and then attend to its cure.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the urethra, then its indication is thus:  suppression of urine from it, and prohibition of this so that the place may be consolidated with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the hip or into the bone and causes pain in the surrounding area, then its sign is that the probe penetrates there if there is no tortuosity in the bone, and pain in the surrounding area; and that there is always pus from it; and that medication is ineffective, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the cure of these is the labor and vanity of foolish physicians on which they are fixed.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for, according to what I shall recount to you, and this which I have already proven.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back and raises his legs upwards, his thighs being inclined towards his belly, and then introduce a lead or bronze probe if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe penetrates.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, then you should insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe itself penetrating by itself, besides what you feel between your finger and that fistula or flesh, then you know certainly that this is penetrating; and then do not work on it, for there is no cure in that, as we have said.
However, some say that it is healed slowly in some men.
And of the medication by which help is expected for him, it is that you ignite a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as is described before, and introduce that ignited cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat that two or three times until you know that all those fleshy parts adhering to the fistula, which resemble a bird's quill, are cauterized.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen until all those cauterized parts fall off, and then treat it with medicines that generate and consolidate flesh, and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate beyond your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or fistula, and you see the fistula in that way, that it is the surface of the rectum, then dry the rectum from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it dry with the probe, and it should be in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the end of the probe arrives, and by the probe it is freed and removed.
And then cleanse those fistulous fleshy parts which resemble a bird's quill, and let no part of them remain.
But if you see a flow of blood come between you and your operation when you are cauterizing those tissues, then the best and lightest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire achieves two good things: that is, the cauterization of those adherent tissues, and the stanching of blood and drying of the humors.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen or crushed flaxseed until the area forms a scab, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate hard flesh.
And these are medicines in which there is stypticity and desiccation; when it is restored, it is healed and we do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula penetrates to the rectum and is elongated from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and explore with it.
And so if you feel the fistula and between you and it there is a covering of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation there except by way of trust and hope.
Which requires one of three methods: either cauterize it as we have said; or dry it until you reach its cavity so that you can insert the poultices and the cure is close; and do not proceed much with incision lest you cut the muscle containing the rectum, and cause harm to the patient and thus without his will; and then treat it with what we have said, for it will heal quickly; or lengthen that covering and clean out the pus after drying it near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp point, and then clean those fistulous parts which are in the incision where you can with cauterization; and then strive to make the restoration of the whole wound with incision, and if the upper orifice is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the part of the anus, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the tail and in the margin of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like a needle for preparing hides in this shape:
and insert it into that fistula wrapped in five threads or around them; and then insert a probe with thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it penetrates into the margin of the anus further inside, then you pull the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the anus; and pull out the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it for a day or two, and when you further cut the thread into the flesh, tighten it well until those parts of flesh are cut which are between the two ends of the thread and so that they fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very much in the perineum, because it is not for you to do that lest you cut the muscle; and then treat it until it is healed.
The form of the pointed probe with which the fistula is probed: its curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as sometimes happens.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows during their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, for either they are between the buttocks similar to charcoal, or they are like bunches of grapes. And of these there are small and large ones, and the blood flows from them constantly and it is one, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the months of little humidity, from which flows citrine water or a little blood with continuous discharge, and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you command the patient to strain and express himself until the anus emerges and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you should grasp and lift them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, and then incise them at their roots.
But if the hooks cannot hold them because of their humidity and softness, then grasp them with rough cloth or cotton or a wool pledget, and extract them with your fingers, and then incise them and sprinkle on them some hot powders near the incision, so that they act on them in place of cautery; or cauterize them as is described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey egress, then stimulate the patient with a small, mildly irritating enema, and let it be washed with that water which is in the anus and which easily allows egress when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and it is that you grasp them with your fingernail, or that you grasp them with a hook, and incise them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And whoever wishes to incise them, must administer sutures to them in this manner: take wrapped thread and insert it into a needle and then pull the hemorrhoids upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle into the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and do so laterally; and tightly constrict the hemorrhoid with a strong suture, and then knot the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all of them, and leave one of them untied, so that the superfluous blood may flow from it.
And then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate over the anus; and place that over the anus and command the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat it with ointments or with another cure until it is healed.
And since they are old and that medicine is not effective, then you must scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are moist and the crust above is removed, which prevents their consolidation; and then treat them until they are consolidated (healed).
Then remove them with more force than the first time until they bleed a lot and are excoriated (abraded); and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that an alamermar (or almesamir, likely referring to a boil or abscess), that is a boil, is nothing but a red, round swelling, according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a clove, and it is found throughout the body, and especially in the parts below the feet and in the fingers, and because of it, pain occurs below the swelling.
And then it is necessary that what is in the circumference of the boil be incised, and it should be held with forceps or a hook, and eradicated from its root; and then treat that (the wound).
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been previously explained in its chapter.
Moreover, a wart is a small, rough, fistulated (possibly meaning  "pus-filled" or "with an opening"), round eminence on the surface of the body, and many times it appears on the hands of children.
And its cure is that you stretch and incise it, or that you bind it tightly with a thread or with a hair so that it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize that, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine (caustic substance).
Moreover, a mole is a small, hairy or fistulated (pus-filled/with an opening), large eminence on the surface of the body, often growing in the face; and when cold touches it, it is felt as if a kind of ant bite, and it is found all around the body.
And its cure is that you take a cannula (small tube) of goose quill or vulture quill, and let it be strong, and place that over the mole until the circle of the cannula contains the parts of it; and then, rotate your hand with the cannula until you incise what is in the circumference of the mole, and you place that in the depth of the flesh, and you eradicate the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a brass or iron cannula, according to this method:
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn out to a thinness, blunt (that is, non-perforated), wrapped so that on the said [mole] the application of it may be smoothed and its rotation [easier].
And if you wish, cauterize the mole as was previously mentioned in the cauterization of athel in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the instruments that are used to give a clyster (enema).
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of tin, or of molten or hammered brass; and sometimes it is made of these instruments, small and large, according to those to whom they are administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose rectums are fragile or painful, the clysters for them should be small.
The form of a large and a small clyster:
The head of its cannula, above which the bag is tied, should be wide according to this manner; and let there be a distinction where the bag is tied, as you see.
And the lower extremity, which is inserted into the rectum, should be blunt (that is, not open) and very smooth, tapering to a point; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays and a little larger.
And let the bag, in which the medicines are placed, be made of animal bladder or sheepskin, and let its length be one palm.
And let it be perforated with many holes, so that it is woven; and let the space which is between the holes be the thickness of a finger.
And then insert into those holes strong, raw flax thread, about ten threads, or thereabouts; and attach the bag with that; and when the bag is placed in position, tighten it at the head of the clyster with two distinct, strong constrictions, and then cauterize each hole with that: But the manner of cauterizing with that is that you fill the bag with the medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then let the patient lie supine on their back, and raise their legs up and place under them a cushion on which there is already linen or a sheet; and then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or something similar; and then insert it into the rectum easily, and then let the attendant take the bag and squeeze it with two hands and vigorously until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the bowel; and then remove the clyster and the patient lowers their legs.
And if the medicine forces him to evacuate, retain it as long as possible; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
But if you administer this clyster in cases of diarrhea and the evacuation harms him, then you repeat the clyster until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the rectum, then let the clyster be very thin and soft, of the kind with which infants are clystered.
On the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds what was appropriate for the book, and I say thus the treatment of them with hand and with medicines according to the situation.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what caused the wounds and according to the location on which the wounds fall.
And the causes by which wounds are often made are thus:  a stone throw, or an incision by a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or with a stick, or with an arrow, or similar things from many causes.
But the wounds that are in the locations of the body are thus: a wound which falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the thigh, and similar members.
And I am recounting the treatment of some wounds so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, for the discussion of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from a stone throw or the like, and it has only grazed the scalp and is a large wound, and you fear the occurrence of a hot abscess in that patient, then you should immediately consider and phlebotomize the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and extract blood from him according to the quantity and his strength, unless some cause prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has come from the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side from the wounded part; and guard the patient from repletion and from wine and coarse foods.
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then let his diet be reduced and he should not approach meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs in him, a linen cloth soaked in plain rose oil or in wine in which a styptic has been dissolved.
But if it is certain that a hot abscess will form, then place on the wound, if it is recent, its own blood and the un-altered powder that I will shortly recommend.
And if the air has already altered it, then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or is caused by a sword cut or similar, and its edges are not joined together, then join them with sutures according to the method of suturing I shall recommend.
But if the wound has exposed the bone and hangs, and there is no retention of it but a slight suspension, then incise it and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in place of the bone, and order the patient to be fed foods which are thick: heads and  fowl and things similar, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that which is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood can occur, and it is not stopped by medication, then you search for the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you incise it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity compels you that what we have said is not sufficient, then you cauterize until the bleeding is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is light; thus you dust these with this powder, for it consolidates them before the air alters them.
And the method of the powder is this: take oil of roses one part, dragon's blood two parts, unquenched lime three parts; let all be well crushed and sifted, and with it let the wound be filled, and let it be bound with a good bandage until it adheres well to it, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it above with powders and leave it, and do not unbind it while it is thus, that it is not festered, for the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes it does this alone with heat, when you do not have roses and dragon's blood at hand.
And do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary that it be placed on them and they are tight, and they are recent wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is in summer time, then this powder is not suitable, but rather treat them with what we have said, so that you place on them some digestive ointments, or that you place on them powder of barley flour with water and honey until they discharge pus; and then treat them with the other cure until they are healed.
But if a fracture in the bone happens with the wound, and it is small, then you extract it with tweezers.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what is poisonous.
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound happens in the neck, then there is no difference in medication between it and a wound of the head when it is simple.
But if the nerves of the neck or an artery are cut, then if it is a nerve, there is nothing to do but to avoid treating it with something that causes strong astringency, such as vinegar and vitriol and things similar to them, because they are harmful to the nerves and contract them. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is cured with light medicines, such as being washed with sweet water, sometimes infused with rose oil or plain oil, and then, when it is washed with sweet water and other minor remedies according to this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or draw the lips of it together, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or there is pus at its lowest part, then perforate it at the most depressed point.
But if an artery is incised in the wound and a flow of blood results, then separate or cut it, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessity requires it.
But if the vertebrae of the neck have been incised, or any part, and the veins of the neck have been saved, then you should adjust the edges of the wound with sutures on the neck's bone and do not touch that; first even it out and return it to its natural shape, and then tighten it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days; and then treat it with ointments which have styptic and healing properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has caused damage to the bone, then  cleanse it, and if there are bone fragments in it, extract all those that you can; and what you cannot reach, leave it until the wound suppurates, and is separated and the damage is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle on it the powder which has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with that of which the remedy will be found in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider further if there is a puffing out from the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is fresh with its own blood, then you should apply powder to it in the first hour, and do not bind it tightly so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but apply an attractive ointment, and unbind it twice a day.
And if you do not have ointment at hand, then place old linen on the opening of the wound so that it draws out the moisture; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what is collected there drains away.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and the patient has not suffered spasms, tremor, heart problems, or stricture of the throat, and you see his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with cauterization and other treatments until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore treat that according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it as previously described for sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if damage has been done to the bone, and pieces have been cut from it, then you should clean the wound and try to extract those pieces if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound suppurates, so that their extraction is easier.
And for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the treatment is similar to what we have said.
Of wounds of the abdomen.
The indisposition which happens in the abdomen is either great, small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is made difficult in another way, and it happens that their reduction is more difficult if you do not take care of their replacement to their place immediately, because it opens and is swollen, wherefore their entry is made difficult.
And therefore the moderate rupture is best, because in that one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in the two species previously mentioned.
And know that the suture of the abdomen is according to four methods, but two sutures are common which are suitable for sutures of other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures proper to the abdomen are also used for other wounds, but however they are more proper in the suture of the belly.
And I recount to you each one with explanation and declaration.
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has emerged through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed by the coldness of the air.
And therefore when this is so, then it is necessary that you warm it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone, or that you boil in water squinant, cyperus, and spikenard, and bathe the intestine with this until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes this is done with a substance that has astringent properties, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And then, when you see the inflammation resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and marshmallow have been boiled, for by this the return of the intestine is aided with little difficulty.
But if the return of the intestine is hindered despite this treatment, then incise the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is appropriate that there is no incision, and there is no need to dry due to necessity and debility.
Regarding the instrument, this is its form:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and the end is thin, and it should not be as thin as a spatula, but rather somewhat blunt.
And so, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine protrudes, then its reduction should follow its natural form, to its proper place, if possible in this way, for it is better.
But when the rupture is large, and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should make the patient lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you should raise his head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, then always direct your attention and consideration to ensuring that the side where the wound is located is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, apply what you have prepared, and then have an assistant, whose hands are clean, hold the entire rupture with his hand and adjust its lips, and then, from there to there, let him sew up any other necessary cause.  (The final phrase is slightly ambiguous, possibly implying sewing up any other openings or adjusting the edges further.)
And this is the common method of suturing: first, take a needle, or several needles according to the size of the wound; then, starting from the edge of the rupture, about a finger's breadth from the end, pass the needle through, making sure not to include any sinew in the two ends of the suture, using two ends of the thread which is under the suture, from the inside parts, until you have passed it through that area;  and when you have joined the two ends of the suture material and two ends of the thread, four ends are created. (The phrasing here is challenging;  "ciphac" seems to refer to an additional thread or support, perhaps used to reinforce the suture).
Then tighten with a double thread the loop of the needle, and sometimes from two sides simultaneously, and then bring together the two edges of the wound with a neat approximation; and then leave a finger's breadth, and insert another needle there, and then tie this one with thread as you did with the first needle; and continue doing this with the needles as needed until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And let the needles be of moderate thickness, neither too thick nor too thin, for thin needles cut the flesh too easily; and thick ones are difficult to pass through the suture, therefore they should be of moderate thickness.
And the needle should not be inserted too deeply into the two ends of the suture, so that the flesh is not unnecessarily cut and the wound does not open before it heals.
And the sutures should not be too long, lest the wound be hindered from healing.
Then blunt the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient during sleep; and place over the suture powdered substances on all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave those in place until you know that the wound is healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most suitable for small wounds, because for their suturing one or two needles, or thereabouts, are sufficient.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you suture the four extremities of the wound and two ends of the lip, at once, with a needle around which thread is wrapped, appropriate in both thinness and thickness.
And then, when with the needle you have penetrated these four extremities, return the needle to the same place from which you began, so that the retracted thread falls from the highest part into the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth suture with which cloths are tightened.
And place between each suture the width of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And with such a suture I sewed up the wound which had befallen a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than a palm, and two palms of intestine had come out from the middle of the wound, and the disruption was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he is healed; and afterwards he lived for many years, and is preserved in his faculties.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and it was by a miracle that he was, for I did not cure him with ointment, for it was in a place where ointment was not found nor any medicine, but I placed old linen on the wound twice a day and washed it continually with honey water until it was healed.
But I shall describe two kinds of sutures proper according to the account of Galen (or a similar authoritative source, as "Paraula" is likely a variant spelling or corruption of a name like Galen).
And it is that you begin with the suture of the intestine (or possibly "cord"), and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And so, as the needle penetrates the intestine (or cord) and into that same laceration, following its width and length across the whole body, leave the end of the thread into which you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate at the other end, from the inside to the outside, at the other extremity of the wound.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again at that same extremity of the wound, from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is in this part, and make the needle penetrate at the other extremity, from the inside to the outside.
And make your penetration with that [needle] with which you made that penetration into the thread at the extremity of the wound which is on the patient's side until all of it penetrates.
And then begin from that same side and sew that [wound] with the end of the thread on the other side, and extract the needle from the intestine (or cord) which it penetrated; and then return it to that intestine (or cord) and sew the end of the thread that is on the other side with that extremity of the wound; and extract it from the intestine (or cord) which is on the patient's side.
And do this once and again, and do this one time then another time, until you sew everything that is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suturing is that you sew with a running stitch, with which you sew skins, in such a way that you sew the thread once from the side of the extremity of the intestine (or cord), and that you leave it another time until you have completed it.
But the second proper type of suture, which I call *Gualia*, and this is according to what I have recommended to you, is that you sew it according to a similarity with which some physicians sew it, such that you approximate each part to its corresponding part in the appropriate manner, and apply the end of one part to the end of the wound, and the end of the wound to the other end of the part, and this is done as I have recommended to you.
So that you place the needle in the extremity of the wound closest to the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside part in that same place, and leave the two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside through the two ends of the thread.
And then turn them each, and make each penetrate from the inside part to the outside part through two other extremities of the wound which are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suturing is better than the common, light suture, and it is the suture of which I previously made mention.
This is the method of Gualia.
And more, some say, the suturing of the belly is rectified with two needles, that is, that you insert into each of them a thread, and begin with the introduction of the needle from the side that is nearest to you, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew leather similarly.
And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suture is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen.
But the judgment of the treatment of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
The reason is that when you treat the fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestine and sew it and prepare it decently, then place on it incarnative powder.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then place on it some ointments that are present to you until they form a hard skin and the threads fall out, and they are consolidated with cyprus and myrrh; and then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines present, then place on it immediately, as soon as it begins to discharge pus, old linen, and change it twice a day, as has been taught to you, until it is healed, for you will not need other medication in many cases when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will spread to the principal members, then it is necessary that you soak wool in good quality olive oil, or in rose oil, and place it in the area around the places that are between the armpits and under the armpits.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in the intestines, for many times this happens, then cauterize it with black, warm, styptic wine, and especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and has made a penetrating exit into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is of easier healing than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is of difficult healing because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not receive healing from a wound that falls upon it at all; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of the magnitude of those veins, and because of the subtlety of the body of that intestine, and because of its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is the web [likely referring to a membrane or tissue], and you obtain that recently, reduce it according to your skill with which you reduce the intestines similarly.
But if it has passed into the space and has already become green or black, then you should bind it with gall over the place that is blackened, so that a flow of blood comes, for in the web are veins and arteries.
And then incise that which is beyond that ligament, and place the two ends of the gall hanging from the part below the wound outside it, so that the attraction of it towards the falling of the web and the emission of the arm of the wound may be relieved for you.
A reminder of wounds when they happen in the intestine.
When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some men, for this reason because I saw one who had been wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and had become a fistula, and from it issued a discharge and flatulence.
Then I pursued his cure, although I was not confident in his healing, but I continued to subtly treat it until it was healed and the place was consolidated.
And I, after I saw the place already consolidated, feared for the patient that an accident of illness might befall him in his belly; and no such ill accident befell him, and he remained in his usual disposition, eating and drinking, and then entered a bath and exercised in his ways.
And some experienced ones have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied according to this manner:  that you take ants with large heads; and then bring together the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants, which has its mouth open, upon the two lips of the wound; then when it bites upon those and clenches its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere and not be dissolved.
And then place another ant near the first, and do not cease doing this with ants, one near another, according to the extent of the whole wound.
And then reduce [the intestines] and sew the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and let no harm befall the patient.
And it is also possible that the intestine be tied with fine thread which is made from the intestine of an animal, since it is better for a needle; and it is that you take the end of these intestinal threads, and it should be very clean, and then tie its end with the thread, wrapped, and then insert that thread into needles and sew with it the intestine, and then reduce it into the disruption [the rupture].
And this method of suturing with ants is only a matter of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, because then it is only a reduction [in size], and not a complete healing of it.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas and fistulae.
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated and discharges pus constantly and is not excised, then, in whatever member it may be, is universally called a fistula, and we call that a zukem.  (Note: "Zukem" appears to be a variant spelling or a word from a related dialect meaning fistula).
And a fistula, truthfully, is a hardened, white, knotted formation, which is painless and has a concavity like the concavity of a bird's claw; and therefore it is called a knotted ulcer, that is, claw.
And in some men it is moist, which discharges pus; and very quickly the moisture is excised [or removed] in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes it is thin, and sometimes it is coarse, and sometimes it is subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, and their signs, and their cure with medicines, in the division [of the text/treatise].
And it is necessary that I make known to you the cure of fistula, which is done by means of an operation with the hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas which reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the diaphragm, or the intestine, or the bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the joints composed by composition, such as those of the hand and foot; and those which damage the proximity of a principal member and similar.
Therefore, that one of these fistulas which is according to this manner is among the illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive a cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach those places that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of iron or brass, and if the fistula goes straight, and search for it with it.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a slender lead probe, for lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily bent around the tortuous path.
And if the fistula has many horrific windings, it is not possible for you to ascertain its course with a probe.
Then, inject a cleansing fluid through the opening, for the moisture by which you irrigate it will go through the other openings and clean them.
And then inquire carefully, in whatever way is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves there, and if the depth of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a fistula which has many openings, and attend to all this with the sum of your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain through your compression with the hand over the area, and the signs and accidental causes of the abscess.
And when you have considered all those things with true judgment, then proceed to the treatment with confidence:  and it is that you consider then if the fistula is nearby and apparent, or in a safe place, far from a joint, or from a nerve, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from one of the places which I have told you about.
Then you dry the fistula as was said before in its description, and remove what is in that filtration and of corrupted flesh, and what has grown in the opening of the flesh, or of skin and such things, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it in the front as far as is possible for you, and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh; and then apply cauteries wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce them into the depth of the fistula, which you have grasped with an instrument (or iron).
And do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then you should investigate it and dry it as we have recounted, if you do not prohibit any cause from a vein or nerve or principal member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that will cause it to grow flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the total eradication of the corruption; and then uncover it again and meticulously perform the scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, good; but if not, then know that that corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which you have not reached, and then for you in that case there is nothing to do but leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to pull it out, then you should pull it out with fine forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then meticulously perform the extraction of all of them, and of these leave nothing behind with your strength.
But if any of the humidities cause you difficulty, and in their incision there is no fear or mistake, then incise those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not ready to remove the bones at this time, then apply something to the wound that will cause it to suppurate, and leave it until that reaches the area around those bones of flesh and ligaments, and keep the wound from closing, and keep the incision that you made in your operation constricted.
Then, if you fear, place on it a cloth soaked in crushed rue with oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments, because when those ligaments suppurate, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction is facilitated.
But if it is a large bone, such as a leg bone or thigh bone or similar to those, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape that with a rasp only superficially until that blackness and corruption is removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and completely incise to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat that until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use that as an example and help in your operation.
There was a man young in age, around 30 years old, who experienced pain in his thigh, and from the inner parts, pus spread through the matter within the body until the matter reached the thigh, and it was matter of an abscess with a large abscess, and there was no external cause for it.
And then time passed with that due to the error of the physicians until the abscess was opened, and much matter flowed from it, and its treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulated, and many orifices were made in it, all of which discharged pus and the humors of the body.
And then many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wisdom in those men in the art, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those orifices in great quantity; and already the body of that man was entirely weakened and his color was jaundiced (citrine).
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and the probe reached the bone.
And then I quickly examined all the orifices and found that they reached from all parts of the leg.
And then I considered and incised one of those orifices until I uncovered a part of the bone, and I found it corrupt, and it was already rotten, corrupt, and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted where it had penetrated to the marrow.
And then I sawed away what was uncovered and prepared of the exposed bone to me.
And I believed that in the bone there was nothing but that corruption which I cut away and sawed, and I had already eradicated it.
And then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicine for a long time, and it is not consolidated (healed).
And then I again iterated and uncovered the bone a second time upon the first uncovering, and I found continued corruption in the bone.
And I sawed away what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was thwarted in making its cure and restoration, and it is not restored.
And then I uncovered it another time and did not cease to incise the bone little by little, piece by piece, and forcefully attempted its restoration, and it was not restored until I had incised about a palm's breadth of it, and that I extracted with its marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it is slightly consolidated and healed.
And further iteration in the operation and sectioning of it is not necessary except for the disposition of its fragility and for the scantiness of its tolerance and fear of death, for it happened to him at all hours through the superfluity of evacuation, a bad syncope.
And therefore it is healed by a complete healing, and nothing is in place of the hard bone flesh; and its disposition in its body is made good and its strength returned; and it is converted to its dispositions and caused him no impediment in walking nor harm in any matter.
But if it is a prominent bone in a place already excised, then you must excise that according to this manner: and it is that you take a ligature and bind that to the extremity of that prominent bone, and command someone to extend it upwards; and place another ligature of thicker wool over the first ligature; and then tie that over the flesh that is below the bone, and extend the extremity of it so that you pull the flesh to the parts below, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or a board decently under the bone, for when you do this, the saw is not prohibited from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place little by little, for if there is corruption in the concavity of the bone and it does not appear in its outward appearance to the senses, then force the sawing of it another time.
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent,  but one part is continuous with another, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part of it, then you uncover the flesh from all parts completely; and then place wood underneath, and then saw it from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous with the other part.
And let the sawing be according to the place of the corruption, little by little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no reason but ingenuity [or skill/cleverness] in it.
And if the corruption is in the chest [presumably meaning the palm] of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, it is necessary that you investigate the corruption in whatever way appears to you, and that you open it, and clean it according to each disposition which is possible for you, and with every tool [or ingenuity/skill] be rectified to you, when it does not oppose you vein or nerve.
And know that the incisors and saws to incise these bones are many according to the location of the bones, and the preparation of them, and the thickness of them, and the subtlety and the size and the smallness of them, and the hardness and their rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument convenient to that operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the kind of instrument of which you have need; because with you is great study and long and knowledge of the ways of this art, and testimony of ways of illnesses, because then you already have for yourself what is convenient in the matter of instruments for every illness.
And I am forming for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will place as simple ones, with which you will proceed to your prohibition which you will experience upon the others. (The meaning of "prohibicio" here is unclear and may require further context.  It could relate to a surgical procedure or a treatment to be avoided.) Form of saw:
Form of another saw:
Form of another large saw:
Form of a ray (or spoke, depending on context.  Could also refer to a type of fish, but given the context of saws, it's more likely a tool part). Let the head of this ray be according to the form of a star-shaped nail head, and its points be according to the form of the points of a [possibly awl or similar pointed tool -  "alstefegi" seems to be a made-up or archaic word needing further context for precise translation].
And it is only suitable that with that [tool/ray described above] the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the mouth [presumably a wound or opening] is wide open.
Form of a smaller razor:
Form of a broad/wide razor:
Form of another saw decently made: let it be made of the most excellent wood arched, and its sharpness of iron, and its handle of well-made boxwood. Its form/shape:
Form of a razor which has a concavity:
Form of another, subtle razor:
Form of another razor with a curved end:
Form of a small razor resembling a probe:
Form of another, smaller incisor:
Form of another incisor; this one resembles a ray, and its end is like a saw, and it is used in many places in the treatment of bones:
Form of a ray which is suitable for the treatment of that which is perforated in the bones:
And its end is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly it is necessary that all the things we have said about razors, and incisors, and saws [apply to this instrument as well].
Of the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Extremities may be affected either by an intrinsic or extrinsic cause; or if you have treated that corruption with those medicines and the treatment is not effective, or you see the corruption spreading through the limb without any apparent cause, then you must incise that limb to the point where the corruption has reached, so that the patient escapes death or the worse affliction of limb loss.
And the sign of this happening is that the limb turns black as if it were burned by fire, or the blackness spreads until the putrefaction reaches the limb and threatens to spread throughout the body; and therefore, treat it with an incision.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some venomous creature, such as a sea scorpion, a viper, or a spider, and similar things.
And if the corruption or sting is in the extremity of a finger, then you incise the finger and do not give space to the corruption so that it spreads to the hand.
And similarly, if it happens in the hand, then you incise it from the root of the palm, and do not give space to the corruption to spread to the forearm.
And if it affects the arm, then incise the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then in that case the patient's death is certain; and to administer anything other than this in treatment is a waste of effort.
And similarly, if corruption affects a toe, then you incise it up to one of the ankle bones.
And if it takes hold in the heel, then you incise the whole foot. But if it ascends into the knee, then you incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy for him but dismissal, and to leave the patient to die.
And the manner of incising the limb or sawing it is that you tighten a ligature on the lower part which you wish to incise, and tighten another ligature above the location; and let the assistant extend a ligature to the lower parts, and let the assistant extend another ligature above; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures with a spatula until all the flesh is uncovered; and then let it be incised or sawn.
And it is necessary that linen cloth be placed on all parts so that it does not touch the healthy place, and that the patient's injury and hot abscess be properly dressed.
But if you encounter a flow of blood when you operate, then you carefully cauterize the affected area, or place on it some powders that staunch the blood; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have recounted to you, which is that a blackness occurred in his foot with a burn that resembled a fire burn.
And that corruption occurred first in his toe before it spread to the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself, because he saw the cure proceeding to the limb with such vehemence that he suffered from pain and burning, and he incised that foot up to the joint, and thus it healed.
A long time later, the same corruption occurred in the finger of his index hand.
And then he came to me, and I tried to repel that superfluity with what I applied to his hand in the way of medicine, to cleanse his body; and the superfluity was not repelled and began to spread to another finger until it began in the hand.
And he asked me to incise his hand, but I did not want to do so, hoping for the repulsion of that superfluity, and moreover fearing lest the incision of his hand prove fatal, because the patient's strength was failing.
And after he departed from me, he returned to his land, and it was reported to me that that man prepared and incised his entire hand, and he was healed.
And this narrative is added only to help in the case of this disease, and to indicate a method by which it may be understood and according to which it may be treated.
Concerning the treatment of sinuses and the nature of clyster administration with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in fleshy limbs and the space of the abscess is extended until it forms a collection of pus, and then it is broken and perforated, and the pus has flowed out, leaving the place empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is over it is like thin cloth, and it has not reached further corruption, and it does not involve the bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and not a fistula.
But however, if the space is extended to the point that the corruption affects some member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And its treatment is to incise that skin entirely as it is involved, especially when it is thinned and is like cloth, and to ensure that it does not adhere to the location due to its corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin adheres and that the corruption has not spread further, and there is swelling of the skin, then you treat that with a clyster.
And consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the arm that is affected has a foul odor, then clysterize it with an Egyptian medicine which is made of oil, sour wine, and resin, taking equal parts, and let them be mixed in a vessel, and let them be cooked over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then take what is necessary from it and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize the sinus with this, and constrict its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
And then extract that with a sponge; and do this for as many days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with lye water, when this medicine is not present to you; and you take the ashes of vines, and put water over it; and then filter that and clysterize with it until you are confident that the sinus is then clean.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the lye water, then clysterize with water and honey in which crushed resin is mixed, and clysterize with mixed wine and honey, for it is a property of honey to cleanse and wash, and wine makes it adhere to the sinus, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are confident that the sinus is now clean, then clysterize it with something that causes flesh to grow there.
And you should take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or clysterize with some other medicines and ointments that possess the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, so that the clyster cannula cannot be inserted, then widen it little by little with a small iron instrument, and place a small, rolled-up cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment inside until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then approximate its lips with a suture and leave enough space for the clyster to enter without difficulty.
And if the opening from which the pus flows is situated higher up, then dry the lowest point of the area so that the pus will flow downwards, for when the pus is confined within the depth of the sinus, flesh will not grow there.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus to the lowest point of the bone as desired, then make sure to prepare the limb with a preparation which allows the pus to flow easily as you see fit, and that nothing obstructs the drainage of the pus.
But the cloth that is over the opening of the sinus, you should change that frequently so that whatever pus collects there drains away. And so that you may know if the pus that flows from the wound is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And by this you will ascertain the state of the sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and whether there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment continues in this manner, and you see that the material that was placed over the opening of the sinus is now adhering, or is about to adhere, then on the second or third day loosen it, and when you loosen the dressing, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if near the sinus there is a subtle poison, then do not be discouraged by its adhesion, for its healing is imminent. For there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and there are those in whom the opposite is true.
And if undigested pus has flowed from the sinus for many days, then know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust the drying quality of the medicines. And if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry, such as diafinicon ointment, when excess is added to it as a  treatment.
And the best remedy with which it is cured is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and add old, good wine to its substance, and mix that with it, and use that.
And it acts similarly in that case, when there is no pus: diafinicon ointment, honey cooked until thickened, and use that; or take myrrh, aloes, and incense, grind it all and pulverize it over honey while it is on the fire, then spread this on a cloth and bind it over the sinus; and spread that cooked honey (until thickened) and pulverize it on a cloth and bind it.
And sometimes aristolochia longa and lily of the valley roots (and it is lily of the valley) and chickpea flour and centaury are administered with it; and use those simples or compounded, grind them and sift them and powder them over the honey that has been mentioned; and use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the bone of it, and it already makes inquiry into the bones or other hard parts or ligaments; then you cure it with a fistular cure, as is said above.
Of the cure of paronychia and worn nails and added finger incision and section.
Paronychia is an abscess which arises under the nail of the finger or toe of the hand or foot, and quickly spreads to other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its cure is less valued, or it is abscessed by a hot abscess, or it is corrupt, and throws out pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and quickly corrupts the whole nail, and quickly its corruption reaches the bone until there is a foul odor to it, and the extremity of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.
And therefore when you have that with what we have said in the division and you do not succeed with your treatment, then it is necessary that you incise with iron all the superfluity that remains of the nail and then cauterize the wound near that, because a hot cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the additions of the nail, now empty, compress the flesh at the underlying parts, and begin to prick and injure it, then it is necessary that you place a thin blade under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it up and incise that flesh easily, and place on what remains of the flesh corrosive, cauterizing medicines until it is all removed; and then cure that with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone and extract it, for a bone that is corrupt will never heal.
And if you see the corrosion and corruption spreading in the finger, then you should incise it at one of the joints, according to the advice previously given, and then cure it until it is healed.
But if the nail suffers a blow or friction, and experiences severe pain, then you should first bleed the patient, and then dry the nail with a sharp spatula with a transverse cut from above downwards, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause the patient severe pain, and it will be the cause of the generation of superfluous flesh in the area; and then treat that area with something that relieves pain.
But a finger that is born in the hands of some men is entirely fleshy, or has very little bone, or very little nail.
And some of them are born at the root of a joint, or their growth is in some of the joints of the fingers. But that which is born in some joint of the finger does not hurt, and that which is born in the joints is easily injured.
And for those that are fleshy, the incision is easy, and you should incise that below its root with a broad spatula.
But for that which is born at the root of a joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of its excision.
But for that which is born on a finger between the joints, you should first incise its flesh with a round incision down to the bone, and then saw it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then treat it until it is healed.
But consolidation which happens to the fingers between their knuckles, either by the birth of a man thus formed, or by the consolidation of a wound, or by burning with fire, or the like; then it is necessary that you separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they are not lightly consolidated, and separate them, or place between them a thin sheet of lead until it is consolidated as needed.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you should separate that consolidation according to how it is situated and suitable to the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of vices, they are various.
Vices are various, and they are twisted, thick veins full of melancholic superfluities which appear in many parts of the body, and their greatest occurrence is in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and porters.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
But the cure of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they be incised and that black blood be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be raised and entirely extracted.
The incision is done in this manner: first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick, foul blood is resolved from the leg. Then bind the patient's leg from the highest part of the thigh to below the knee with a bandage, and then cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision. Then raise the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards and from above downwards, until the quantity of blood you wish and deem sufficient has been extracted, which will remove the patient's ailment.
Then bind it up, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
But their elevation is according to this method: you who raise the patient's leg, if there is much hair on it, then put it in a bath and bathe the leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins are prominent; or, if a bath is not available, let it be exercised strenuously until the limb is heated.
Then incise the vein on the straight part of the vein by a longitudinal incision behind the knee, or at the lowest part behind the ankle.
Then open the vein with an incision and scarify the vein on all sides until it appears sensitive, and it is from this appearance that you see that redness turning to blackness.
And then, when you have opened the vein, you will see that white thing which is like a cord.
Then you place a thread under it so that it is elevated and is drawn away from the vein, and suspend it with a golden or lead weight.
Then make another incision near that incision for three fingers' breadth, and then scarify the vein from the part above the vein until it appears.
Then elevate it and incise it in the second incision towards the heel, and then extract it and elevate it until it is pulled out through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until it is all removed; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey you in being extracted and elevated, then introduce a needle with strong double thread and tie it and extract it, or introduce a thread under it and rotate your hand in every direction until it is ejected. And be careful that it is not incised; for if it is broken, it becomes difficult for you to elevate it much and it becomes a danger for the patient because of that injury.
And when it is all removed, then place on the wound site wool soaked in rose wine and olive oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having tortuosity to which there is a twisting in parts, and it is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary that you make incisions upon it in every part of its tortuosity and in the places of its twisting, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it entirely.
And be careful in your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not injure it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your prudence in this.
The form of the incision with which the vein is cut:
It is not made pointed like hooks, nor is it of a sharp extremity so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of thick flexibility, like lion, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein by its thinness; it has superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, as in Al-Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the hot and arid lands of India, of little humidity, and in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And very easily it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And its gestation is from putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents, worms, and scabies, and worms engendering between the skin and the flesh, come from within the body.
And a sign of the susceptibility to the coming of it is that in the leg a vehement inflammation occurs; and nearby the place is blistered; and nearby the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blister, which resembles the root of a plant.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one drachm to two drachms, and tie it and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as you see something of it coming to the outside parts, wrap that in lead and tie it. And if the growth is prolonged, then you incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise its root until it has come out, for if you incise it, it is retracted and enters the flesh and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place and a bad ulceration.
Therefore it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is expelled from the body and no part of it remains in the body.
And from this vein it has issued in some men to a length of five palms and fingers, and it has already come to my attention that one of twenty palms has issued.
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, then introduce a probe into its opening and perforate it with a long passage through the body, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the place for some days with medicines; and then cure it according to the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many orifices come to it, and a branch issues from each orifice.
And therefore cure it in the way we have said in the division and with what has been said above.
Concerning the incision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
This illness is called in some lands near us bovine illness because it often happens to cattle and is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and goes throughout the body rising and falling, and is shown by the feeling of its movement from limb to limb until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is by the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and earthworms and ascarids happen in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, for when it goes into the body and is elevated to the head, and has reached the eye, then it quickly enters it and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure this and extract it, then it is done only by observing its movement and appearance to the touch, and then it is necessary that you tightly bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong ligature and constriction, and then cauterize it and extract it.
And if it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you do not find it, then you apply a hot cautery to the place until it dies, and the greatest cause that is feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the place as we have said.
But if you see it has reached the head near the eye, then bind above the eyebrow with a strong ligature, and then cauterize it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body with medicines evacuating bad putrid humors, and guard himself from foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the illness nafir.
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain which comes in some limbs, and then is moved from limb to limb.
And I have already seen that, as I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small inflammation in the basilic vein of the arm, and after it had remained for an hour, I saw that inflammation moving like a worm climbing upwards, but more lightly than a snake, as if it were quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and fixed itself in the muscle, and remained there for about an hour.
And then it ran to the other side until it reached the other arm.
And then I remembered that it was moving throughout her body, as I saw; and I was very surprised by its movement and the speed from one limb to another. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in that manner, however I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my eyes as clearly as in the woman.
And I considered that this was so because the woman was old, with a dry body and exposed veins, and in this way, that windy affliction was made apparent.
And it is necessary that it does not appear according to this retro-cure in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And if you want his cure, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press lightly on it and dry it until that trapped wind is expelled, and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you treat it with rubbing of the body and with that which expels winds, and drive them away with foul-smelling pills and with pills of serapium and the like.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in the body where they fall, for their diversity is that some have large points, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones, that is solid ones; and some that have three angles, and some that have barbs; and some that have feathers.
And of the signs of the brain, it is when an arrow falls into it and pierces the bone, and emerges from the skull which is over the brain, for there happens a sudden violent headache, and dimness of vision (scotoma), and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile, and speech is quickly cut off and the voice is destroyed, and there issues from the place of the wound a white moisture resembling pus, and a discharge resembling watery flesh.
And therefore if these signs appear to you, then abstain from the cure and the extraction of the arrow, unless it is already outside.
But the signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart, are that it is near the left nipple, and feels as if it were stuck in something hard, and not in something empty; and very quickly the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope; and therefore know that death approaches without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are thus:  frothy blood issues from the wound, and the vessels near the neck are inflamed, and the color of the patient is changed, and he breathes with great difficulty, and desires the intake of cool air.
And if the arrow falls into the diaphragm which is in the chest, the pain is then near the ribs, and the breath is drawn with violent pain and with sighing, and not all the muscles of the limbs are paralyzed.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then very quickly some undigested food comes from the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the abdomen, and is fixed there, there will be some discharge of pus from the wound, or the intestine, or bowel which is ruptured, and there is no hope of cure without extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine flows out, and some matter proceeds from it to the external parts, and very quickly pain comes upon the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other members, such as the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the armpits, and the vertebrae of the back, and the clavicle, and the hip, and the leg and similar members, are saved according to the best dispositions when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I recount this to you that I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may thereby signify your own cure.
Which is the reason why, in a man, an arrow fell into the lacrimal duct of his eye at the root of his nose, and I extracted it from him on the other side, below his ear, and he was healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which fell into him in the corner of his eye, below the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden and I found nothing of it but a small point with which it adhered to its shaft, and it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with an iron head in which there were no barbs.
And the Jew was healed, and no ill accident befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had fallen into his throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, and this is one which has barbs; and then I incised upon it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I worked subtly with it, and then I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and therefore, since thirty days had passed and no change had come upon him in his condition, I incised over the arrow and extracted it, and he was healed, and no ill accident befell him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow fell into his back, and the wound had healed over him, and since it was almost seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound is healed within her, and she is not changed in any of her conditions, and the woman finds no impediment in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow fell in his face, and the wound is healed and the arrow broken, finding no great pain, and many similar to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king's man that had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already declined a little to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to his cure about three days after the arrow's impact.
And then I found the wound from the arrow very narrow; and then I explored it with a slender probe, and did not feel it; but he felt a pricking under his right ear, and then I suspected that that pricking was from the end of the arrow.
And I plastered the place with a plaster which has attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the place would suppurate so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut it out.
And no significant accident occurred in the place that the arrow had reached; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no accident occurred; and the wound consolidated meanwhile, and the patient rested from its extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with a probe I tested it, and found the subtle point of the arrow, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I adjusted the application of the sharp medicine to the wound until the point of the arrow appeared visibly to me, and I spent time with this for a period of up to four months.
And then, since the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and remove it, and I did not succeed in this way, then I did not cease to refine and devise ways and means to do this, until I managed one day, using ingenious instruments, to grasp it with carefully-made forceps, as the form of these will appear at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored that wound.
And some physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, and I restored it, and the wound is consolidated, and the patient is healed with complete health, and he suffered no harm from it in any way.
And I recount to you the manner of extraction of certain arrows so that you may establish a rule and understanding of that which I have not mentioned, for the parts of this art and its definitions are not comprehended in a narrative, nor do the books contain them.
And skillful artisans compare the little with the much; and what is present with what is absent; and they find new operations and new instruments because of the difficulty of removing foreign bodies from the art when it happens.
Therefore I say that arrows are not removed from the limbs in which they are fixed except in two ways: either by traction from the place where they enter; or by counter-traction from the opposite side.
And that which is removed from the place where it entered, is an arrow embedded in fleshy tissue, and is pulled and removed.
And if it does not yield to extraction at the time of injury, then you must leave it for a few days until the flesh around it softens, and the extraction and its removal are eased.
And similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not yield to extraction, then leave it for a few days and repeat the extraction and movement each day, and it will eventually be removed.
And if it still does not yield after a few days, then you must perforate the bone around the arrow on all sides with a thin drill until the area around the arrow is widened, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body and is beyond feeling, then you should probe for it with a probe, and if you feel it, then draw it out with instruments suitable for its extraction.
And if you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the projectile, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then you should incise the wound to widen it so that it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if it is held fast by barbs, then you must free the flesh in which it is embedded from all sides with all the skill you can muster; and work on it, if you cannot manage its removal, by fracturing the barbs and twisting them until they yield.
And when you undertake the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use twisting with your hand and forceps on all sides until it yields; and proceed with great subtlety so that the arrow is not broken and that its extraction is not made difficult for you.
And if you cannot manage it at that time, then leave it for a few days until the parts surrounding it soften, and then try again, for then it will be easier. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then apply the remedies we have described in the appropriate chapter.
And be careful to avoid cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use all possible skill in removing the arrow; and do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I have recommended to you.
And therefore, position the patient so that the arrow is aligned with the wound, for this is more helpful. But if that is not possible, then apply what you can, according to the circumstances.
But if the arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part of it protrudes from the wound, or if the arrowhead is bent by pressure from the part above the deep wound and sometimes protrudes, then cut it there; and let the incision be the same size as the forceps grasp; and then pull it out, for it will come out easily in this way.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then twist the blade against the arrow until it is embedded in the bone, and widen the opening, and then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is still in the wound, then push it in further.
But if the shaft has fallen out and you want to apply pressure, then insert, if it is blunt, a concave instrument so that the concavity fits over the arrow's tail and then push it in.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then push it in with a strong instrument entering into it, for the arrow will be loosened by this.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cut away all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow penetrates the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut it out, then cut it out and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then sew the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
The form of forceps with which arrows are extracted:
Let the ends of them be like a bird's beak, which are made like a saw when they grip the arrow so that they do not let go of it.
And of these, many types are made, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the size of the wound, and the tightness of it.
like a ray, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which the customary number is thirty, of which sixteen are in the head; that is, two pulsating veins which are near the ears, called  *alhasisain* [likely a mis-spelling or corruption of a term needing further research]; two veins that are in the two apparent temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called *aspicientz* [likely a misspelling or corruption]; and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and the vein which is at the end of the nose; and two *guidegi* [unclear, needs further investigation] which are at the neck; and two veins which are in the upper lip; and two veins which are in the lower lip; and — these are the veins which are called *algelic* [likely a misspelling or corruption] —; and there are two veins which are under the tongue. But the veins which are phlebotomized in the arms are five; for of those there is one cephalic, and it is beside the wild vein; and the people call it “the vein of the head”, and it is a thick vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilic, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people name that one “vein of the whole body”, and the basilic is the vein which is located in the inner arm, and is named “citillar”, and the common people name that one “vein of the belly”; and the *funis* of the arm, and it is located above the *focil* [likely referring to a specific anatomical location, needs further investigation], and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the pulse by manifest appearance; and *salvatella*, and it is the vein which is between the index finger and the little finger, and there are two branches in it.
And in the foot and the leg there are three veins; one of those is that which is below the curvature of the knee on the outer side of the leg; and the second is the saphena, and its location is below the leg on the inner side of the leg; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the outer side of the leg; and in the leg there are other veins similar to those.
The opening of the veins which are near the ears is for chronic cataracts and migraine and *sahafati* [unclear, needs further investigation] and old, chronic ulcers of the head.
And the manner of bleeding those is as I have recounted to you: it is that the head of the patient should be shaved, and the head of the patient should be rubbed at the occiput in the location of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then the patient should tighten his neck with a bandage until the two veins and their locations appear near the ears in two depressed areas of the head; and seek those with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those with your finger, then bleed with a lancet.
Then you take the lancet knife, and it is that which is incisive, and then you introduce that under the vein in the elbow until the blood comes out. Then raise your hand with the vein and the elbow to the upper parts and incise the vein with an incisive incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers joined, or thereabouts; and let blood come out as much as you wish.
Then bind it with powders and leave it until it is healed.
And already and previously in the beginning of the book, the incision of these and their cauterization.  (A more natural English phrasing might be: "The incision and cauterization of these were already described at the beginning of this book.")
But from the two arteries that are at the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for chronic migraine and sudden severe pain, and persistent ophthalmia, and a flow of acute superfluities effused into the eyes.
And the manner of phlebotomizing these is as I have recounted to you: constrict the patient's neck very tightly until the two veins appear to the touch by manifest appearance and their pulse is demonstrated beneath your finger; and then you incise with a lancet.
Then you raise the skin above the vein in the upper parts with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy incision underneath, and raise the vein upwards; and incise it just as you have done in the other two veins; and let blood flow according to your necessity.
And then loosen the constriction of the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then place cotton and powder on it and bind it above with strong compression, and leave it until it is healed.
And now the remembrance of them, and their incision, and the drawing [of blood] has been preceded in the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in ancient diseases of the face and for migraine, rigidity, and foul ulcers.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is as I recount to you; that is, that the patient constrict his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is named a lancet, of which this is the form:
Place the pointed end, which is at the head of the lancet, upon that vein and strike it with a hammer or other similar thing in its manner, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you wish; and then loosen the constriction of the patient and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however it is not fitting that the phlebotomy be of an acute extremity like the other phlebotomies, rather it should be of a broad extremity, and phlebotomize it according to the transverse, because the bone is near and would easily break the phlebotomy when it is subtle [thin].
But the benefit of the two veins that are at the lacrimal ducts of the two eyes is for scabies of the eyes, for redness and swelling in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the manner of the phlebotomy is that the patient constricts his neck with a bandage, and then phlebotomize those veins, and you should be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made transversely, a little lengthwise with a small phlebotomy instrument, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the phlebotomy instrument is thin, its point is easily broken.
And then make the blood flow as much as is necessary for you, and place cotton on those [wounds], and bind them for a night, and then unbind them.
But phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and violent headache, and for diseases of the face and migraine and redness that occurs in the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient constricts his neck and then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin phlebotomy instrument and insert it into the middle of the nasal bridge in a straight line, because the vein is not palpable there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
So that you slowly withdraw your hand with the phlebotomy instrument little by little and make the blood flow according to your need; and then bind it for a night, because it is lightly restored [healed].
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the two jugular veins [is for] the constriction of the throat and the beginning of leprosy and many illnesses and impetigo and bad corrosive ulcers as well as herpes.
And the manner of phlebotomy of those [veins] is that the patient should constrict both sides of his neck with a ligature; and the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be seated on a stool.
And then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide phlebotomy instrument little by little; and then extract blood according to a measured quantity or according to what the need requires; and then do likewise to the other vein.
And then untie the ligature and constrict the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning because the wound is healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the alveolar veins helps with small abscesses and pustules of the mouth and corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of phlebotomy of those [veins] is that you make the patient sit before you, and constrict his neck with a bandage, and then roll back his lips and look for two veins, of which one is on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the indication of each is by the blackness of each of both, and this is more so because in the area of those there are small black veins; and then incise each with an incisive incision.
But if doubt remains, and you don't know which is which, then you should incise the larger of those, and the most evident of those.
And do likewise for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of the two veins that are below the tongue, the benefit is for the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for inflammations that are in the throat, for disease of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing these is that you hold the patient between your hands facing the sun, and lift their tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side is a vein and on the other side a vein, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to overextend your hand in phlebotomizing these, because beneath these are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the neck are those which run customarily in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either they are opened with a myrtle or olive-shaped phlebotomy instrument of thinning design; or they are cut with a lancet-shaped phlebotomy instrument, and it is called an alnessil, and this is its form:
Let its width be thus as you see, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy instrument is of lesser width and of a more subtle extremity, and is suitable for phlebotomy of thin veins that contain thin, clear blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: because it draws out the blood of illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and of that which affects the feet and abdomen.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, that he carefully guards against and is extremely cautious in this, because beneath it is an artery, and if he errs and is inaccurate in the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood, so it is necessary that he does not phlebotomize this with a sharp phlebotomy instrument, before it is cut with an instrument. (The last part is a bit ambiguous and might mean "before the vein is cut open with a lancet.")
And if the basilic vein does not appear in manifest view, then it is necessary that you leave that one and that you move to another, or that you seek one of its branches; or that you phlebotomize in the place of the end of the arm, for that is manifest; and cut that with a lancet-like phlebotomy instrument, as we have said.
But if you wish phlebotomy in the same place, then before the constriction of the arm, touch the area until you know the location of the pulse, and then mark it with ink; and then tie the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision with a lancet-like phlebotomy instrument as we have said; and be careful that the incision does not fall in any space near the artery.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, inflation in the place you have marked with ink, then that inflation is inflation of the artery, and therefore avoid that place.
And if you see the blood flowing from the phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery; and then you should quickly place your finger over it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood flow is stopped, for many times it is stopped, then you loosen the arm and leave it.
And watch over the patient's movement, and let there be supervision of him and do not anger him for some days until he is healed.
But if the blood is not stopped, and you see that you do not have a present remedy for this, then you should incise the artery, if it appears to you; because its extremity is constricted, and the blood is stopped; or that you take the bark of a fig tree, and pulverize it, and take half and apply it to the place of the vein with a descending constriction using a ligature and powders until the next day.
And then if the blood is stopped, it is good; and if not, then treat it with that which has been previously mentioned in the recollection of the place of the powders that stop the flow of blood.
And the stopping of his blood is difficult in many dispositions because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.
But in the case of the dark vein, phlebotomy is helpful, which draws blood from the superior part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it behooves the phlebotomist to be very careful in his phlebotomy, because below it is a nerve; and if he errs in the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, stupor will befall him, and his healing is difficult, and perhaps he will never be completely healed. And this nerve often appears to the senses; and if it is hidden from some men and is subtle and is not shown, then it behooves you to perform the phlebotomy with which you perform phlebotomy with a slight incision, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should open the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps in diseases of the eyes.
And it is fitting in this case, if you wish the phlebotomist to puncture with an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped phlebotomy instrument; because it is the safest of all veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, a small abscess forms quickly in some men when it is not phlebotomized at the first percussion, but this abscess does no harm.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and for its hope and caution against the onset of illnesses, and that phlebotomy should be performed in one of the veins that are in the elbow, that is: cephalic, median cubital, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtime, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the third day or on the first, after three hours have passed since daybreak.
But phlebotomy, which is administered when it provokes suitability and necessity for it, may be done at night or day, at any hour and at any time.
And it is necessary that a child should not be phlebotomized until he is fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be phlebotomized except from the fourth month until the seventh, and old women who have passed sixty years should not be phlebotomized.
And if someone wishes to be phlebotomized in any way, it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a cleansing enema, if he has much retained waste in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities from the bowels into the phlebotomy, which are putrid, and that they may not harm the principal members.
And let not patients with nausea and diarrhea be phlebotomized, nor those recovering from illness or fever until this is resolved, nor those with dropsy; and moreover, phlebotomy should be avoided near a colic attack, near vomiting, and near intestinal problems, and near excessive intercourse and labor and exercise, fasting, or vigils, and every cause that dissolves strength, be it bodily or vital.
And consider beforehand the thinning of humors if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if it is possible for him.
And then enter a bath if no cause prohibits it, or be exercised by some activity so that the blood may be thinned.
And perform his phlebotomy in the middle of the day, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all harmful accidents, both physical, such as anguish, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, such as excessive labor and exertion, sexual intercourse, and things similar.
And let there be present at his bedside things whose use is customary among men, with aromatics and perfumes, and with balms and similar things, according to what is possible.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion higher than the cushion of the one who is to be phlebotomized.
Then he should extend his arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it with his hand two or three times; then he should tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is uneven, or if the constriction is excessive, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it prevents the free flow of blood.
And before the constriction, it is necessary that the one who is to be phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly visible.
Then the phlebotomist should anoint his fleam with a little old oil; and then he should place the index finger of his left hand on the vein, below the spot where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein moves slightly, and the percussion should cease because those veins which are found thus like a fleeing string should be avoided for phlebotomy, and those that are full of air, when you place the fleam on them, contract from the fleam, and the phlebotomist is deceived; and the fleam does not open the vein, and if it opens, it is tightly closed.
Therefore, the phlebotomist must be skilled and attentive to all these things.
Then apply the fleam, but if the vein is opened at once, it is good; and if not, repeat the process in another place a little below or above, with speed, if the area is not inflamed.
And if the area is inflamed, or the patient is frightened, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, because it will quickly draw a hot abscess, nor should he enter a bath.
And then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows slowly, and you fear that the desired quantity of blood will not be drawn, then repeat the phlebotomy in that opening, following its straightness and widening the opening slightly, and do this quickly before the area becomes inflamed, because in many men the area becomes inflamed from a small opening.
But if you see that it is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it will not help; and place on it some olive oil, for it relieves the body of blood. And olive oil is better in this instance than other oils.
Similarly, administer olive oil in all phlebotomies with which you bleed veins to prevent blood clots, and they make this with theriac and sagapenum when one of these is placed on the area, because the blood is thinned and is resolved when it is thick.
And if a large abscess is generated at the site of the phlebotomy, which happens frequently, and especially in one who has been bled only once, or through a small opening in the vein, then take care and place on the area a sponge soaked in slightly warmed water and salt, and compress it for an hour, for it will resolve it.
And it is necessary to do this immediately after the bleeding from that vein, or from another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the place for some days, it does not matter; and if you wish, place on it some aloe and myrrh dissolved, or some mint juice or calamint or something similar.
And abscesses and swellings often occur after phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And then place your hand on it, and if you then find softness under your compression, then that swelling is malignant and bad; and then be careful to place on it some of what we have said, for blood will very quickly flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has styptic properties, so that the place is hardened, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary to extract blood from everyone according to the quantity of their strength and according to the color predominating in the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp (or acrid), until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong and needs bloodletting at once, that the phlebotomy of the vein be widened and the phlebotomy be wide.
And in one who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to extract [blood] in several times, and the opening should be narrow.
And the best way to administer phlebotomy is that the section be transverse, not a puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safe from excessive bleeding and injury to nerves, and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to latitude and longitude (i.e., a lengthwise incision).
And to the one who is accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, you should treat them before the phlebotomy with a little bread infused in pomegranate wine or warmed simple oxymel; and extract the blood from them in three or four times.
And if there is coldness of complexion, then before phlebotomy take bread infused in syrup of myrrh or in honey syrup flavored with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and the like, or in a fragrant and very aromatic syrup.
And if syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and it is caused by the loss of much blood, then they should drink meat broth and a very subtly fragrant syrup; and use aromatherapy with rosewater, and let their feet be bathed with it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the section on syncope due to evacuation (in the chapter on syncope).
And whoever wants to bleed their arm and dissolve their blood a second time, it is necessary for that person, for whom phlebotomy is for the purpose of evacuation and whose strength is weak, that they evacuate blood little by little, that is, according to the amount of strength they have, on continuous days.
But whoever wants to bleed their arm and shed their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then let them do so about seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
But whoever wants to draw blood from their body, contrary to the side to which the illness inclines, should be bled on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much already heated blood, and it is acute and causes fever, should have blood drawn from it at once, and a large quantity should be drawn, and the opening should be widened until syncope occurs, provided you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on their pulse below the heart, so that death does not result instead of syncope, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not advisable, when you want to untie the arm and evacuate blood a second time, that the opening of the vein is already closed and the exit of blood is difficult, that you press on it with vehemence and the arm is bent slightly, because that is very bad.
Having left it until it is bled a second time; or remove it with the sharpness of the phlebotomy tool that is coagulated with blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it theriac, alfarach, or sage, and compress it with light pressure until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it and do not touch it until the inflammation has subsided.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed it in that place or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "rope of the arm" is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic or basilic, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient immerses his hand in warm water until the vein reddens and appears clearly.
Then it should be tightened with a bandage with moderate constriction; and then phlebotomize according to the small transversal, not latitudinally nor longitudinally.
And let the opening be wide, and your phlebotomy with which you phlebotomize it should be a little above the joint of the hand.
And if the flow of blood is impeded, then immerse the hand again in warm water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your need.
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from re-immersion of the hand in warm water, and the measure is to place the bowl of blood in warm water in winter time.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, because beneath it there is no pulsating vein nor nerve.
And phlebotomy of the little vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the manner of phlebotomy is that you should bind the hand with a ligature or with your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you incise it entirely, it will not harm in any way.
And take care not to extend your cut with the phlebotomy too far, for beneath are the nerves of the fingers denuded of flesh.
And then return the hand to the warm water and let the blood flow into it, for if you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be impeded.
And when the blood has been drawn according to the amount needed, then you place oil and salt on the vein so that it is not quickly closed; and similarly you should do in every narrow vein.
But the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is helpful for diseases of the spleen.
And do similarly in his phlebotomy as you have done in the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy from the saphenous vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and for the retention of menses, and for the diseases of old sores and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and for similar diseases.
And the method of his phlebotomy is that the patient puts his foot in warm water and rubs it until the veins appear well; and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap; and the place of the vein is usually apparent below the little toe, and from it are many branches ramified on the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize the largest branch below the leg, below the ankle, because it is better and healthier.
And if you phlebotomize that on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are below it on the surface of the foot, and perform your phlebotomy with which you phlebotomize across, as if you wanted to incise it.
And let the phlebotomy be skillful.
But if the bleeding is prohibited; then you immerse his foot in warm water and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs on the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, because the location is safe; and do not fear to harm him, but be wary of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same to the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
And of the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, below the ankle on the outer side.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for him is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient enters a bath, and fastens and tightens his thigh from the hip joint up to above the ankle with a long, thin bandage, for it does not appear otherwise.
And then, when it appears, you phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you and according to the transverse vein; that is better. Or incise it by incision or cut it by section, for its location is safe.
And it is often very hidden in many men; and if you find it and it doesn't appear to the touch at all, then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let the amount of blood flow that you wish.
And then loosen the bandage and place cotton over the phlebotomy site and bind the place, for it heals easily.
Concerning cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cups are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and blood extraction, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And for cups that are administered with scarification and blood extraction, there are fourteen places on the body, of which one in which cups are placed is the nape of the neck, and it is the back part of the head; and the middle place of the two sides of the neck together; and cups on the chin below the jaw, below the mouth; and cups on the two shoulder blades; and cups on the loins, and this is above the end of the hip bone; and cups on the two flanks, and these are on the two sides; and cups on the two hips; and cups on the two thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not deplete the strength through them, as is the case with phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any disease caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity calls for cupping because of illness or a chronic condition, administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle of it, and at any time.
Therefore, when you see any of these conditions, especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we command that cupping be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it is applied, it relieves the heaviness in the head and that which is settled in the eyes; but it is necessary that this be in addition to the evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not permitted to use it on one who is of cold complexion, or in whom there is catarrh, for it causes great harm to such a person.
And for this reason, it is not fitting to use it on the elderly, and on those whose heads suffer from cold illnesses.
But to the one on whom this is continuously applied, oblivion (fainting) is caused; and for that reason, you should command the cupper to place his hand a little with the cupping glass towards the lower parts, to prevent the production of oblivion (fainting).
But cupping of the elbow is in the place of phlebotomy of the vena fusca and the basilica vein: and for that reason it benefits asthma, and the constriction of the throat, and the splitting of the throat's instrument (possibly referring to a split or damaged uvula/vocal chords), and cough, and repletion (congestion).
And it is necessary that the cupping glass at the elbow be slightly raised, for if it is placed lower down, it produces weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And cupping of the temple benefits accidental pains in the head and ophthalmia, and migraine, and suffocation, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And it is necessary that you command the cupper that he not press his hand with scarification lest he incise the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin benefits ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar to those diseases that are in the mouth, and it stands in place of phlebotomy of the veins that are in the two lips.
But cupping that is done on the two shoulder blades benefits catarrh, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping of the two inner parts of the ankles benefits in the same way as phlebotomy of three veins, that is, of the basilica, mediana (or possibly 'fusca', which could mean dark or obscure), and cephalic veins, because it draws blood from all those smaller veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins until the drawing reaches the three named veins.
And command the cupper that he not proceed excessively in scarification, because the place is devoid of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cupping-glass with which one cups on the hips and it benefits haemorrhoids of the rectum and deeper ulcers.
And it is necessary that you command the cupper that it be a large cupping-glass, and that it be of brass, because the place requires strong suction; and quickly are thin cupping-glasses broken and it should be scarified with scarification.
But cupping of the legs diminishes pain by evident lessening, because it draws blood from the whole body, and it benefits old pains of the joints and of the womb, and of the bladder; and it provokes menstruation, and benefits swelling and dropsy; and it stands in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and of the two jugular veins (or possibly "cavilhas" refers to other veins in the leg).
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause syncope in many men.
And of the jugular cupping, the benefit is similar to the benefit of cupping of the two legs.
And the quality of the application of the cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass initially empty and draw by moderate suction, and do not prolong the application of the cupping glasses, but apply them lightly, and remove them carefully, so that the humors come to the place by equal distribution. And do not cease to iterate this and continue until you see the place redden and swell and the drawing of blood appear.
And then you scarify and iterate the suction little by little, and consider the condition of the body.
Because that man who is of tender flesh and rare pores, it is fitting that you scarify him once and no more, lest the place be ulcerated.
And command the cupper to amplify the scarification and make a small cut, and moderate the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to scarify twice, for in the first time the way of thinning is opened to the blood and its watery parts. But in the second, to the scrutiny acquired by the extraction of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then let scarification be done a third time so that it achieves the desired effect.
Finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, one scarification is enough for us.
And if we want extraction of much blood, we make many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that we scarify with deep scarifications.
And the term scarification refers only to the depth of the incision.
And if the skin of the one to be treated is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are constricted, the sites for cupping should be anointed with softening, opening, and resolving ointments; if it is summer, such as aloe oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is winter, then narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or blood oil, and similar things.
And if the excess [humor] is thick and cold, then let the oil be amaranth oil, or balm oil, or aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar things.
But if the patient has large pores and tender flesh, then the use of oil should be avoided, and for such a person, the cupping sites should be washed with vinegar or cold water of nightshade, or with poppy water, or with bordelais water, and similar things.
And for one whose blood is excessively moist, wash the cupping sites with sharp vinegar, or with myrtle and sumac water, and similar things.
And for one whose humors are thick, wash the cupping sites with old wine, or with water of sansevieria (possibly a mis-identification, likely a plant with similar properties), which is marjoram, or with a decoction of anise, or of chamomile, and similar things.
And the cupping should be done before the bath; rather, it should be administered about an hour or two before the bath, and the patient should sleep after the cupping.
What is it that the person to be cupped or bled should observe before cupping?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the person to be cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp, inflamed blood, then they should take cooling things, such as sour pomegranates, endive in sharp vinegar, lettuce, and dried borage, and julep, and things like them.
And give them foods such as chicken, and the meat of domestic birds, and foods seasoned with acids, and similar things.
And for someone whose complexion is cold, they should drink syrup of almonds, or syrup of dried borage seed, and sumac, and very fragrant wine (between vintage and Christmas); and they should be advised to eat and drink sparingly, and give them foods such as chicken, hempseed, peas, small birds, and doves.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, their drink should be greater than their food.
And it is necessary that at certain times, some men be given theriac alpharac, or medicines of musk, that is, nutmeg, or celadine before cupping or bloodletting, or afterwards, so that the principal members may be comforted and the blood thinned; and they should not take those things when they are heated.
But the cuppings that are without scarification should be applied to the liver, and over the spleen and gout, and over the navel, in the places of the knees, and the groin, because these members do not tolerate scarification on them.
And it is not desired for these (cuppings) except the drawing of blood from a limb, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in the illness of a nasal hemorrhage; and we use this so that cold, viscous windiness of the limb may be dissolved, just as we place it on the abdomen and navel; for this rarefies the limb and warms it and reduces pain because it resolves windiness.
And it is placed on the tonsils when they suffer from obstruction or swelling, for by the virtue of strong attraction it quickly opens the obstruction and eradicates the swelling from its place.
And similarly it acts when it is placed on the liver and spleen because of windiness enclosed within them.
And these cuppings are administered empty with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and is larger, that is, with hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Method of cupping administered with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, according to how we have formed it; and the length of the handle be half a palm; and let it be on the side, in the place that is in the circumference, half of it, the hole should be small enough for a needle to enter it.
Let it be made of bronze, copper, or citrus wood, with thick edges, smooth, even, and polished so that it does not injure the limb upon its placement.
And in the middle of it, let there be a transverse bar of bronze or iron, where a candle with fire is placed.
And let this cupping glass be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one smaller than that, according to the illness and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses for infants and thin people are different from the cupping glasses for young people and those with large bodies.
And the way to place this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to extend the wick with a suitably sized wood fire in front of a small wax candle, and place this on the middle of the transverse bar in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is lit around the lower part, so that the patient's body is not burned.
Then let it be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger on the hole we have mentioned, until, when we hold the cupping glasses and do not need to remove the finger and let the vapor escape through that hole, then the cupping glass will immediately be detached.
And then ignite the wick according to its method, and repeat if you need to.
But in cupping, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse bar or hole, and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and it is placed on the limb alone.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs where the placement of cupping glasses is not possible, because of their small size, such as the ear and gums and similar; or on a member devoid of flesh, such as a finger and nose and similar.
And the quality of using those is that you should find leeches in clean, fresh waters of stagnant pools.
And then let them be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and so that no substance remains in their bellies; and then let the body be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and cupping; and then rub the patient's limb until it reddens; and then they should be placed upon it.
And when they are full and fall off.
And if it is possible to draw blood from the area with a cupping glass, it is more beneficial afterwards.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with warm water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged near the application of the leeches, and it is oozing, then dip a cloth in cold water, and place that on top until the oozing stops.
And if the bleeding is profuse, then sprinkle on it crushed vitriol, or gallnuts and similar styptic substances, until the bleeding stops; or let halves of cooked fava beans be placed on the area, and left there until the beans stick to the place, and the bleeding is stopped.
And it is fitting, if necessary, to iterate the leeches, when it is possible to change those.
And if the leeches are prevented from attaching, then rub the area with fresh blood or prick the area with a needle until blood comes out; and then let them be applied, because when they sense any blood they will immediately attach themselves.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little crushed aloes, or salt, or ashes, on them, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: On Restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
Oh, son, know that foolish and vulgar physicians, and those who never looked at the books of the Ancients or read a single letter of them, boast of this chapter.
And for this reason, this skill of the learned in our land is kept private; and I have never forgotten this at all; and I have not added what I learned except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and study on their understanding, until I extracted the science from them.
And then I applied it to experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter everything that my knowledge contains and on which I have experimented; since I have abbreviated it for you and freed it from lengthy occupation; and I have abbreviated it to the point of brevity; and I have shown it clearly; and I have illustrated it with many forms of instruments that are used in it, as is done by way of explanation, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter one.
Summaries and collections on the subject of bone fractures, those which are necessary to be stated before we begin the discussion of broken limbs and their various types. Therefore, I will state in the prologue of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters in understanding which, at the beginning, the artisan and practitioner must focus on their truth; that is, you and those who are quick to learn or teach this noble art, different from you.
Therefore I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall happens to someone, then you should initially consider phlebotomy or bloodletting, or both together, unless some cause prohibits it, such as weakness, or the person injured is a child, or an elderly person in decrepitude, or it is a time of extreme heat or extreme cold.
And furthermore, let the patient be satisfied with a diet of cold herbs and the flesh of birds and rabbits; and we prohibit fatty meats and overfilling with food and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are certain of a hot abscess, and if you do not fear effusion of matter into the limb.
And then return the patient to their former regimen, to which they are accustomed.
And so, as the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient should be fed nutritious foods, substantial and heavy foods with viscosity, such as foods made from wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads [possibly referring to specific cuts of meat], and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and similar things; and with this regimen, the consolidation of the fracture is made more easily and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in the very young and in the elderly, cannot be rejoined and consolidated according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs.
However, nature adapts and applies to the broken bone from all sides some substance similar to glue, in which there is thickness that adheres to and binds it until it is completely conjoined and bound together, until it attains strength and firmness, like fire at the beginning, until no cause prevents it from its work.
And for this reason it is necessary that you give the patient foods in which there is weight, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the bone of the foot is different from a fracture of the bone of the arm; and similarly all the other limbs are different from one another.
And I come to the remembrance of every type of fracture, explained in its own chapter distinct from the others.
There is great diversity of fractures in themselves. And the types of bone fractures are diversified in themselves; for there is an arched fracture, different from that which happens in the stars; and sometimes a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the shaft and splinters and additions, proceeding and not-proceeding, as is done in the quill when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And for each type there is a proper device or treatment in its restoration, as will be remembered distinctly in its place.
Many are the signs of bone fracture. And thus a bone fracture is known: by its crookedness, and by the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and by it when we compress it with the hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor is it felt by your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
Perhaps there is a crookedness or small fissure; then you should not move it with your hand and with total compression; rather, place on it the medicines of which remembrance will be found near that moment, which is appropriate for the location; and then let it be tightened by a subtle bandage.
And know that if the place is curved and not split in two, or if nothing else happens to it that is noticeable, as if the entire part were removed from its comparison, then you must begin your work at the rectification of it before an abscess happens to it.
And if a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for some days until the abscess ceases; and then dress it according to whatever method you can, lightly and skillfully.
And know that the restoration and healing of it is easier than of a bone in which a noticeable injury has occurred.
And then tighten it as the healing progresses.
But if there is injury to the bone, then extension of that broken limb is necessary in two parts, if it is the hand or foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two cords or with one cord and your hand.
And be in a position where you place the limb in a dressing according to its natural shape, while the broken parts of the limb are extended; then you must force those additions back into place with skill and in whatever way you can.
And take care, according to your strength, that you do not cause pain or injury to the patient through your operation; and force yourself, to the best of your ability, to apply one bone to its fellow, according to their best alignment.
And it is necessary that at that time you profitably touch that with your hand, and if you see any abnormality there, rectify it and adjust it to the extent of your ability.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, as many foolish physicians do, who often cause hot abscesses through their operation, or cause contraction in the limb, as we have seen them do many times.
And the quality of the binding of the calmed limb is that which I recommend; so that you know that broken limbs are diversified in their smallness and in their largeness and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the wrist and similar to them, then the bandage should be of very fine soft cloth.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, the bandage should be strong and firm, because a firm bandage connects the large limb and binds it on all sides with an even binding, so that no blemish enters it.
Then begin, after your reduction, to place a bandage suitable for this, over the place of the fracture, with three or four layers according to what the limb requires; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
And then come with that to the highest part of the fracture site, and tighten less than you did your binding with which you bound the fracture site. And then extend the bandage from the fracture site a little, and soften the binding little by little, until you have covered a large part of the area.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with a bandage, and then bring the bandages to the lower part of the fracture; and let your action in the tightening of the bandage and in the softening of it be as we have said in the first bandage above.
And then place between the layers of bandage some lion's mane tow or cloth, which will equalize the crookedness of the fracture, if there is crookedness; and if not, do not put anything there.
And then place another bandage over it, and then apply properly made splints over these bandages immediately, if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the area, and then apply something that dries the abscess and reduces the inflammation; and leave that for a few days; and then you tighten the splints over it.
And let the splints be half the width of a shaved cane, and well and wisely shaped; or let them be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint that is placed over the fracture be somewhat thicker and wider than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to the length of the limb in size and smallness; and then tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then bind over it with a suitable thread according to what we have said about tightening, and that is that your tightening should be greater in the area of the fracture, and the farther away from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the practice of some fools putting their threads of twisted rope, it is a great error, when the tightening loses its evenness.
And similarly, very fine threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with them what you want by tightening, and there should not be less than one finger's width between splint and splint.
And if the patient is irritated by the ends of the splints near the binding in those places, then place under those splints some carded flax or wool so that it does not cause him injury.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption occurs in the bone, and I will return to that in the following chapter according to its specific nature.
And know that not every broken limb is splinted on the first day; the reason is that, when the limb is large, you should not apply splints until about five or seven days, or more, depending on your assessment of the risk of a hot abscess developing.
And this is the manner of the plasters with which the Ancients made restorations; these are placed on fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
A method of common plaster, a shortened version for the restoration of fractures, suitable for many constitutions and especially for women and children, because it is something which neither heat nor cold affects:  it is to take the powder of the mill, which is the fine flour dust that settles on the walls of the mill from the movement of the millstones.
And prepare it thus, except that you sieve it with egg white, and make the resulting mixture neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of plaster for restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take of asafoetida, of ladanum, of acacia, of elecampane, and of wild pomegranate root, of each one drachm; of myrrh and aloes, five drachms; of aloes, twenty drachms; all should be crushed and sifted and mixed with  aloes water or with egg white if the patient's constitution is hot; and then use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores lightly broken bones, and it benefits many people.
Another method of plaster which benefits fractures and sprains: take of wild pomegranate root and of marshmallow root, ten drachms; of myrrh and of aloes, five drachms; of acacia, six drachms; of Armenian bole, twenty drachms.
All should be crushed in a mortar with great care, and sifted, and mixed with water or with egg white and be administered.
A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and if pain occurs in those and in fissures and fractures: let soiled wool be taken and submerged in sour wine and boiled oil and be placed on the affected area.
But in this plaster there is no restorative virtue; it rather draws out hot abscesses and expels pain.
Another method of plaster that restores a broken bone: take leaves of the wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; pound everything and make a plaster of them.
A shortened method of plaster administered for the restoration of a bone fracture and when you desire resolution of the remainder of an abscess: take roots of marshmallow, of chamomile, and violet flowers, of barley flour, of all equal parts; let them all be crushed and mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then mix it with moist coriander water or with water and use it.
Another method of plaster, stronger in resolution than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb: take roots of marshmallow and linseed, and pomegranate, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all in equal parts; let them all be crushed and mixed with willow water or with fresh water or with wine, all this according to the quality of the limb and the restoration of its color.
However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommended that it be of medium consistency between thick and thin.
But in Wales it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb during its restoration, and the things which have drying properties with a little heat are like myrrh, incense, and similar to those things that we have mentioned.
Method for a plaster that helps with injury and pain: take millet, wax, shaved human hair or bird down, and marshmallow, and salt, in equal parts; let them be crushed and sifted and mixed, and let a plaster be made.
But the amount of time the bandage should remain and then be loosened is that you should consider whether pain or itching has occurred, or if the bone is broken or dislocated; then you should not loosen it for many days. And if vehement pain, itching, or inflammation occurs at the site, then you should carefully loosen or remove it at that time, and remove the plaster from it.
And take linen cloth and a moist sea sponge, and immerse it in lukewarm water, and with that wash the area until that itching ceases and the pain is calmed; and then let the limb rest for an hour; and then place on it clean wool soaked in sour wine and oil or rose oil, and bind it on for a night until you are sure of a hot abscess, and that the inflammation of the limb has subsided, and its pain is lessened.
And then repeat that subtle binding and small plaster and do not tighten it as much as your first binding, and refine it with that until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess, redness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms have subsided completely, and there is no need for plaster and binding, then you should repeat it as you did at the beginning, equally.
And if none of the conditions we have mentioned occur in the limb, then do not unbind it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days, depending on what appears to you from unbinding the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and approaches the coagulation of the flesh upon it.
And then adjust the binding more than in your first binding, and adjust it to the thickening of the patient's flesh, as his recovery progresses.
But if you see the fracture site drying and thinning more than is appropriate, then you should know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it; and therefore, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you unbind it; and let this be done every three days; and loosen the binding a little, and by this operation, nourishment will reach the limb, and it will heal easily.
But what foolish restorers of fractured limbs do, when it is not set correctly at the beginning, and is set crookedly, is an error according to their practice, and a great danger; and if it were correct, the Ancients would have mentioned it in their books and would have worked with it.
And I have not seen anyone do this, wherefore it is more reasonable not to do it.
Chapter Two: On fractures when they occur in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow from a sword, and the blow shatters the entire bone into pieces, which are below the bone, just as happens in wood, and because of this, this type is called *ascial* (or axial); or the sword cuts a part of the bone, and cuts the flesh but the cut does not go through to the back; and this type of fracture is called *levatio absoluta* (complete elevation or perhaps a clean cut).
And the wound of these two fractures is either large or small; and there is a fracture that is a crushing or grinding; and its cause is a blow with a blunt object or a fall on a rock, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, almost reaching the membrane which is below the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the wound of these two fractures is either large or small.
And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone, as small as the thickness of a hair, and because of this, this type is called a hairline fracture.
And there is a fracture that is caused by a fall or by a blow from a stone and the like, which causes some lamina of the bone to enter the inner parts, and it is made in a concave place, just as happens to the rims of helmets when they receive a blow and a part of them is driven inwards.
And this happens mostly in the bodies of moist bones, such as the heads of infants.
And in all these types of comminuted fractures, the pieces are like separated stars. And I will return everything to its place with repositioning.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by probing them and by investigating them with probes, and by the presence of corrupted flesh which is over them.
And a hairline fracture is known because it is uncovered on the bone, and is wiped clean, and then examined with a probe, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of a fracture, consider first the patient's symptoms.  Then, if you see symptoms that clearly indicate danger, such as vomiting of bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, swelling of the eyes and redness of them, and similar symptoms indicating serious complications, without a doubt, it is not easily healed.
And if you see no unusual symptoms, and you expect recovery, then you begin its treatment.
The reason is that if the injured person comes to you at the beginning of the injury, and this is during the winter days, then you must study the condition of the bone before the fourteenth day, according to all circumstances.
And if it is in the summer days, then you must be careful to examine the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone is corrupted by the panniculus (tissue), and before the complications we have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the pannicle covering the brain, and is with small and comminuted fragments, then you must incise the comminuted and crushed part, as I will explain to you.
And so you shave the head of the injured patient, and expose the bone according to custom and manner as best you can, according to the nature of the wound, and that it be light on the patient.
And if you encounter during the examination of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then you must oppose it with what is necessary, and that is to fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess is sedated and you are sure of the blood flow; and then begin with the surrounding of the bone and its removal.
And this should be according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow incisor, and this is its shape:  And then apply another incisor, this one, a little wider than that one; and this is its shape:
And then apply yet wider incisors than the second.
And it is necessary that you have several different incisors, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others and are sharpened at the ends, and are made of Indian iron or steel.
And use them carefully, striking the incisor so that you do not break the head and damage it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then you must perforate its circumference before you apply the incisors with the drills, which are called shallow drills.
And they are not called thus except because those do not reach the bone of the skull, because the drill has a round end or edge below its sharp head, similar to a small edge or circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each of which is suitable for the thickness of each bone, so that you have one for every part of the skull, the tip of which is sharp, its length and shortness being according to the thickness of that part of the skull.
And this is the form of three types of drills: The method of perforating the circumference of the broken bone is to place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone is penetrated; then move the drill to another place, and place them so that the distance between each hole is the width of a finger or thereabouts.
And then incise with incisors that which is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as possible, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument that you have prepared for this purpose, such as thin tongs and forceps.
And it is necessary that you take great care that the incisor does not touch any part of the brain.
And so, when you have encircled the bone by perforation, and it is separated from the brain if it is connected to it, and you have extracted it, you must scrape and smooth its roughness, both what is on the bone and what is within the bone, with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and finer than the other incisors.
And if some small and jagged bone fragments remain, then remove them easily with one of the instruments; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments that we have mentioned.
And another method of operation is easier and less frightening, which Gualia described and praised greatly; and this is his account: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin by uncovering the part of the bone at the location where the fracture is most severe and most evident, until, when you have uncovered that part and placed under it the end of that slow and gentle incisor of which this is the form:
And it is so that the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is divided into two edges lengthwise, like a chisel; so that the lenticular part is fitted to the brain, with its sharp edge facing the bone.
And then strike the incisor on one side with a small mallet until you have incised all the bone easily as it is curved, and you are sure of the panniculus [a layer of the body] that no accident occurs to it in any way, even if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, even if he were sleeping.
Then, if anything remains attached to the bone of the panniculus in some parts of the bone, incise it with the lenticular end of that incisor, and remove it easily, for it is removed without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the panniculus, and what is cut away or removed from the bone is its surface, and there remain roughness and small splinters, then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that it is possible for you to use in each place those most suitable and those most appropriate according to the way in which you conduct your operation on that broken bone and its form.
And it is necessary that you proceed in your scraping, with which you scrape the bone, beginning with the broadest of those rasps, and then use progressively the finer ones, and do not cease doing this continuously until you come to using the finest and most subtle of all those.
But in all other small, capillary fractures and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer treatment according to what you apply to their rectification.
And it is a matter that is not hidden from all those who have studied this art. And I stand by what we have shown written above concerning large fractures.
And if the panniculus (muscle layer) is retracted when you scrape the bone, then it is necessary that you take a cloth according to the size of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound; and then take another doubled or tripled cloth and submerge it in wine and rose oil and place it over the thin cloth and do this as lightly as you can so that you do not injure the tissue; and then administer a broad bandage over that, and do not tighten it except to the extent that it holds the wound alone.
And leave it with this dressing for one or two days until you are sure of a hot abscess; and then unbind it and then administer medicines which draw out superfluous moisture, such as flaxseed, barley flour,  powder of lentils and birthwort, and similar things.
And it is so that you make a powder of these medicines that is sprinkled on the wound, once they are dried; and universally, administer to it any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not to bite (cause further irritation).
And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment is clean; and that there is no dirt or anything else in it; and do not allow virulence to increase in it; for when it is applied to the pannicle (membrane) of the brain, it corrupts it and rots it, and from this a malignant illness befalls the patient.
And it happens in the tissue of the head, as the bone is cleaned of it, and especially when its treatment is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore consider then, if the accidents that we have mentioned befall the patient, know that it is perilous without a doubt.
And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine that is placed on top, and it is in the virtue of that medicine to produce that blackness, then it is necessary that you take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and with these moisten a cloth, and then place it over the area; and then treat it with the remedies that are suitable until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken except in two superior parts together, or one of those sometimes, because in it are two bones, because the lower part is cartilaginous, and it is not broken and nothing happens to it but abrasion and crookedness and sinuosity.
But if one of the two parts of it is broken, then it is necessary that you insert your little finger into his nose, and that you adjust that fracture inside with your index finger, and with your thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you easily, and be careful that you do not cause the patient pain through your operation.
And if the fracture is in the uppermost part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it is necessary that it be set with the end of a thin rod.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same for both.
And take care to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the seventh or tenth day you should treat the resulting abscess with cautery.
And then insert into the end of the nose a small roll of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part, or two small wedges if the fracture is in two parts, and let the wedge be of sufficient size to fill the opening in the nose.
And some of the ancient restorers say that the wedges should be soaked in a decoction and changed every day, but that is not my practice; rather it is necessary that the roll be soaked in egg white mixed with powdered barley; and then leave the wedge in place until the bone is set and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a wedge, a goose feather, wrapped in linen cloth, is inserted into the nose; and this is done when the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, use wedges.
And if another hot abscess occurs, plaster the nose with cerate or with cotton soaked in sour wine and rose oil, or with diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to plaster the outside with sesame flour and cooked lentil powder mixed with egg white; and then place linen over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the nasal bones are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted, then it is necessary to make an incision over them, and extract them with instruments suitable for this; and then close the incision, and treat it with what causes granulation and consolidation, and with plasters suitable for this.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with wedges and administer lead cannulae until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
On the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe then if the fracture is only external and is not broken in two and is bent inwards, then its diagnosis is easy.
And it is necessary, therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with it the convexity of the inward fracture towards the outer parts, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; thus properly equalizing it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from two sides according to straightness until its equalization is possible.
And if concussion of teeth occurs with disruption, then bind those which you hope will remain with gold or silver wire or silk; and then place a plaster over the broken jaw, and then place a doubled cloth over it, and place over the cloth a well-made large splint, or a piece of sole leather equal to the length of the jaw; and then bind that above according to how the binding appears to you and as the application suits, until it is healed.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him food of sorbitive leons. (Note: "sorbitive leons" requires further research to determine the precise meaning.  It likely refers to a type of easily digestible food.)
And if you estimate that the shape is already altered in some way, then you should consider and unbind it on the third day; and then rectify that which is already altered and plaster it with powdered barley, with egg white, or with bean flour, after you have removed the plaster, and place wool over the plaster.
And then, when this plaster is attached and fitted over it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not unbind it until it is healed and the fracture is firm; for many times this fracture is fixed in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its sedation until it is healed, and let that abscess be softened/matured. (The meaning of "remaugut" is inferred based on context; it implies a process of allowing the abscess to mature or break down before draining.)
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of the bone is separated or splintered; then you should carefully remove those splinters with whatever is suitable for that in the removal of them from the instruments. (The tools used are implied by "sturmentz".)
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a fleam (or lancet) according to your needs.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then stitch the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters which is suitable for this and it will fill in that area, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken.
Often the clavicle is broken in the front part above the muscle, and this fracture is done in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is such that splinters occur in it, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is such that the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the splint and sets the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards that part.
Then bind the fracture with your fingers until its shape is made as it should be, and there is neither small prominence nor concavity in it.
And if you need more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's armpit a roll of cloth or wool, and let its size be according to the amount of your need; and extend and elevate the clavicle and compress the roll with your hand until you bind the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle to the outer parts, because it has reached the acromion, then it is necessary that the patient be supine on his neck, and you place on his muscle a moderately sized cushion.
And the assistant presses the muscle towards the lower parts until the bone of the clavicle that is on the acromion above is elevated, and then you rectify the fracture and bind it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the clavicle and they are bothersome, then it is necessary that you make an incision over it and extract those splinters easily.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you carefully make an incision with one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the clavicle the instrument that supports the chin; and this instrument is of wood or iron, of which this is the form:
And it is similar to a spoon of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
But its length should be as possible for the operation; that it has two ends like you see, and one end is wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you incised when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and there is a risk of a hot abscess, then you join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's opening.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then dip a cloth in sour wine and rose oil and wine, and place it on that.
And ensure that the splint does not become dislodged from the broken bone; and for that it is necessary that you see the patient each day, because when the ligament is softened or you see the splint is becoming dislodged, then you correct that and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's arm along their neck, and place a small cushion under their ankle at night, under their arm; so that with this, their injured limb is elevated, and therefore the fracture of the collarbone is elevated from the muscle; or let their arm be tied to their neck.
And do not untie the bandage unless there is a significant swelling or abscess in the area, before twelve days have passed.
And then renew the plaster if you see the need, and adjust the binding, and restore it and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone is restored and coagulated.
And it is strengthened and healed in about 28 days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is broken on its side and not shattered, only the edges [are broken].
And so when the location of the break — and it is broken in the middle of the shoulder blade — is unknown except by touch, then according to the nature of the fracture, prepare it and reduce it to its natural form in every way possible to you.
Then place on the area powdered finely ground albumen with lion's wool; and then place a powder of folded cloth; and then place over it a thin linen bandage according to the size of the whole shoulder blade or a little more.
But if the bandage is concave in any part of the shoulder blade, then you fill that concavity with lion's wool, and then tighten the bandage evenly.
And then bind it above with a long bandage with decent constriction and firmness of the bandage until it is not moved from its place.
And examine the bandage each day; and every time that it is loosened, bind it again and tighten it, and adjust the bandage if it has moved from its place.
And lay the patient on his/her healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 days or in 25.
And so when this number is complete, then you dissolve the bandage, and you should know for certain that this is of the bones whose beginning is not feared nor their dissolution.
And if it proceeds from the location of the collarbone and extends below the clavicle, then you incise over it, and remove it, and proceed as we have said in the fracture of the clavicle, with cauterization of the abscess if it occurs there.
Chapter 7.
On the restoration of a fractured foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in its middle part, and that heals slowly; but its extremities heal much faster because they are splintered and comminuted.
And among the accidents when the middle of the foot is broken is that it inclines towards the inner parts, and great pain occurs, and difficulty in breathing, and cough, and strong fever and vomiting of blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is evident and not hidden from feeling.
And its restoration is that the patient should be supine on his back, and a cushion placed between his shoulders; and then press on his muscles, and adjust his bones with the hands from both sides, and be skillful in the operation and in the setting, in every way that is possible and appropriate, until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be.
Then apply a plaster and lint, and place over it a splint of thin willow or lime wood, or similar in lightness, after you wrap it in cloth; and be careful in binding this over the broken bone so that it is not loosened; and use a bandage in a circular manner around the dorsum sometimes, and tighten it with a decent constriction; and observe the bandage at all times, and when it is loosened, tighten it.
And if necessity demands loosening of the bandage because of corrosion or itching, or pain, or an abscess that occurs in the area, then you should carefully untie it and remove the plaster and rectify what has happened by means of treatment; and then reapply the plaster, if it seems appropriate; and adjust the constriction until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs only happens in the thicker parts, which are two; and in their extremities, on the front part,  damage does not occur because they are cartilaginous. And its diagnosis is not hidden from the sense of touch, through investigation with the fingers.
And the restoration should be thus: equalize the fracture with the fingers as much as possible, until it is aligned as needed, and then plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if that is necessary.
And if the rib fracture is inclined towards the inner parts, then the patient experiences vehement pain and a stabbing sensation, like the stabbing pain that occurs in someone with pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane; and he experiences difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting much blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And already the Ancients were ingenious in that matter with many inventions.
And of them it is said: it is necessary that you give the patient foods that produce inflation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and distended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we would avoid this so that it does not lightly cause a hot abscess, if it does not already exist; and if it already exists, then it helps in that.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on top and that it should be forcefully sucked; and this is similar to reasoning, but nevertheless it is feared that the cupping glass will draw superfluities to the place because of the weakness.
And some of them said: the place must be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is equal to the circumference it encloses; and further, the patient should be treated with a treatment for pleurisy, with diet and medicine.
And if a violent cause constricts the patient, which he cannot bear, and the bone pierces the skin with a lacerating puncture, we fear for the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the place, uncover the broken rib, and then place on top of it an instrument that preserves the [bone] splinter (the mention of which has preceded), and that we incise the bone easily, and extract it.
And then we should approximate the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitching, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an internal abscess occurs, then you should take and mix powders in rose oil and place [the mixture] on the area, and the patient should be treated with what is appropriate for an internal abscess.
And let him lie supine on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and then it leads to their attrition, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider this: for if you see his hands already softened and numb and dead, and he cannot move them, nor extend nor clench them, and when you constrain them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and he feels no pain in them, then know that he is not healed, and in most dispositions, it is mortal.
And if he moves them and feels constriction in them with the fingers and puncture, then know that the marrow of the bone is saved and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if the same thing happens to the vertebrae of the neck and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then observe his feet.
Then, if you see that they are already softened, the same thing has happened to them as to the hands, and then when he lies on his back, he experiences flatulence and excretion without his will, and sometimes he lies on his back and wants to urinate and cannot, then know that it is mortal, and then do not work on his cure.
But if none of those things occur, the condition is better and milder.
And the treatment is that you should perforate the inflamed boil, then place on the affected, rubbed vertebra plain rose oil, or with boiled egg yolks; apply this several times a day until the inflamed boil is reduced.
Then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, and bind it tightly; and instruct the patient to rest and remain calm and not to sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed.
And if, due to the attrition of the bone, a splinter or something similar has separated from it, then you must clean the wound and remove that bone; and then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures if it is large; and then treat it with some incarnative ointment until it is healed.
But if the posterior part of the hip bone is broken, and it is the end of the coccyx, then you should insert the little finger of your left hand into the anus, and with your other hand adjust the broken bone as much as possible according to the appropriate technique; and then apply a plaster and bandage, if you deem it necessary, and then bind it tightly.
And if you feel splinters broken inside, then remove them and treat the wound with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
On the restoration of the hip.
Hip bones are rarely broken, and if they are, the fracture is usually only a separation at their extremities, and they are split lengthwise and incline inwards; and the patient experiences pain and throbbing at the site, and the leg is numb when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is its form.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you bind that according to what is prepared for you by equalization, binding until it resembles its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or inclines downwards, then you make the patient lie on their stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And then, when you have bound it, place a plaster over it, and then place a splint of wood or reed over that, and tighten it with a bandage, over which you do not fear puncture of the fracture nor displacement of the splint.
And bind the cavity with something that fills it until it receives the bandage equally, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease the extension of it and its restoration until the hot abscess is sedated, and place on it that which sedates it as is prescribed; and then return to its restoration, and bind it as is necessary.
And if it happens in the bones that they are pierced or comminuted, then you extract them.
Chapter 11.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the hip and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a wooden splint of moderate thickness according to this form:
And let two bandages be tied at the two extremities, and then it should be suspended from a high place.
And seat the patient on a stool; and then place his broken arm on the splint until it reaches his wrist, in the middle of which the curvature of the splint should be attached.
And then suspend some heavy weight from it, or the assistant should extend it to the lower parts; and then the physician should set the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture is reset as it should be.
And the other method is that the patient be lying on his back on his neck and suspend the hand from his neck with a bandage; and then command two assistants that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with his hands; and the other hold the lower part of it; and each of them should extend to his part.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you tighten above the fracture with a bandage and above that with another bandage, and each of the two assistants should extend to their respective parts.
And so if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the wrist and the other below the fracture near the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed on that place and on that elbow.
Equalize that with ease and without trouble, and then when it is equalized as necessary and is applied with a good application, then tighten that unless a hot abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the constriction until the seventh day, and place on it soiled wool soaked in sour wine and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you tighten that.
And the way to tighten that is to place a plaster over the fracture, and then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm over that support, and place your open hand on its muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the arm over the support so that the arm is in a fixed position, unless some cause of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And it is necessary to place over the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten over the splints with the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is necessary that your bandage over the fracture site be tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be.
And so if you see the placement of the splints and the bandage as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper place, then you have done it correctly.
And if you fear a hot abscess, then you leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then examine the bandage in all parts for three days so that neither itching nor inflammation occurs at the site; or it is forbidden for food to reach the limb due to the pressure of the bandage; and then rectify all this as we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not untie the bandage until three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their side, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place over the splint a poultice full of wool evenly, and check every hour of the night and day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or dissolved, or that the bandage is not softened; then rectify all this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order which we have previously mentioned, so that the food is light at the beginning until the healing has begun; and then you should thicken their food.
For it is customary for the splint and his leg to be bound for forty days; and then they should be unbound and a bath should be administered, and it should be medicated with ointments which rectify that.
And if the fracture is badly crushed, then you should not unbind the bandage and splints from it until 15 days or until two months.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two focils; of which one is small, and it is that which is next to the thumb, and the other is large and it is that which is placed under the little finger, on the lower side.
And very easily the larger focil is broken alone, or the smaller, and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small focil is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is quicker.
And when the focil is broken below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller focil above, then it is convenient for the physician, during its restoration, to apply slight extension easily until it is set.
But if the large focil is what is broken, then it is necessary to apply more forceful extension.
And if both focils are broken together, then you must apply the extension much more strongly.
And it is necessary that you place the figure of the hand during its restoration and its extension stretched out on a cushion, and that the pulse of the hand be in the upper parts, higher than all the other fingers, and the auricular finger be lower than the other fingers, and the patient be lying on a flat couch.
And let there be a cushion in front of him at his height or level, so that the patient does not suffer strain.
Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant extend it above similarly.
And then the physician should manipulate the bone until he reduces it to the best possible position.
And if in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then you must forcefully return all pieces to their place with your skill.
And if a separated splinter appears in him that protrudes and is not within hope of restoration, then saw it off and remove it according to the method which we have described above.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already dealt with this in a separate chapter, and therefore take the treatment from there.
And if an abscess occurs near the beginning of your treatment, then you apply a cloth with a cerate made of rose oil and white wax, and let it be of a medium consistency between thick and thin, and bind the cloth over it with a subtle bandage until the abscess is reduced; and then remove the cerate and apply a plaster prepared from crushed mullen with egg white, and then apply a splint; and let the splint which is placed over the fracture be more padded and firmer.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is varied depending on the major disposition, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
Then apply your bandage over the fracture site more firmly and tightly, and wherever the bandage is more tightly applied to the parts above the fracture or to the parts below it, apply the bandage a little more loosely as was advised at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp cloths, and not hard or rough, and the bandage with which it is bound should be of a medium thickness, neither too thin nor too thick, as we have already recommended.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any circumstance occurs which requires rectification, such as itching which occurs in the limb, then you should bathe the limb with warm water until that itching ceases.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the fracture is now softened and the bone is reset and resembles the others, then rectify all this with your skill.
And further consider if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb by excessive tightness of the bandage, for then it is necessary that you loosen it a little and leave it so for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient experiences none of the conditions we have mentioned, then the bandage should not be loosened for about twenty days or thereabouts.
And then suspend the patient's arm by its own weight for its agitating movement, and make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or very quickly in twenty-eight days, and all this depends on the constitution and the disposition of the body's strength/healing power.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the restoration/healing of a fracture of the wrist and fingers.
Know that in the wrist and the knuckles of the fingers, fractures happen slowly, and they are not often injured, but rather suffer attrition (wear and tear).
And when a fracture or attrition occurs in the hand, then the patient should lie down and place a cushion in front of him, according to the alignment/level, and then place his hand on top of the extended cushion.
Then the assistant extends the broken bones, and the physician aligns them until they are joined with a good union/setting.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, unless a hot abscess is present; and then apply a bandage on top according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the inner parts of the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball of cloth, and instruct the patient to hold it with his fractured palm; then it should be secured with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be of leather with cloth in which it is softened, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tighten it as needed.
But if the fracture is in the outer parts, then it is necessary that you place a bandage on top and another bandage on the underside of the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the splint, in such a way that the hand is bound to the splint between the fingers with bandages.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be straightened as needed and then secured with the palm; and if you wish, apply a small, straight splint so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or the index finger, or the ring finger, or the little finger, then it should be straightened and bound to the finger next to it; or all should be bound together continuously, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and near to that, the disposition of a hot abscess and oppose—with your operation—what is necessary when any of these things happen, according to the repeated narration of the patient.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and this is evident to the senses depending on whether it is broken at the front or the more superior part.
And its restoration is done thus: a bandage is tightened above the fracture and another below the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on their stomach and face.
Then the physician extends the entire bandage to its proper place according to the nature of the fracture, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the hip joint, then the bandage should be close to the knee on the side of the kneecap, so that the extension pulls upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the knee, then the bandage should be placed near the knee, and the extension should be in the lower parts.
Then the physician aligns the bone with both hands until he reduces it to its natural form and the bone is joined by good conjunction; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, unless an abscess occurs in the limb. But if an abscess occurs there, then you leave it for a few days until the abscess has matured and subsided, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be made like this:  You should wrap a firm bandage around the fracture, and fold it two or three times, removing any excess; then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the hip joint.
And insert a long piece of felt between the thigh and the leg near the knee on the lower parts, and let the ends of the felt come from the upper part of both sides, and then wrap around the leg and thigh what is superfluous of the bandage.
And then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture, and place one splint over the leg bone.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is tight.
Then begin with a firm bandage in the middle over the fracture site with three or four wraps, and the farther you get from the fracture site, the looser and softer your bandage should be.
And then extend the two ends of the felt to the lower parts until they reach the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage is not moved from its place.
And then leave the bandage on, ensuring that no gangrene, hot abscess, swelling, or similar conditions occur in the limb; and if any of these conditions occur, then loosen it, and correct the problem promptly, as we have said many times before.
But if there is a piece of bone in the bone that protrudes, then you should reset it as best as you can; and if not, cover it and keep it in place, and treat it with the methods previously mentioned until it heals.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is tightened in addition to the splints being applied, as we have described for the treatment of the arm.
However, in the restoration done in this manner, the patient does not experience lameness; and if it is restored alone, without the other leg being used for support, then it is necessary for him to limp, as he always has.
And know that the thigh is held firmly for forty days, or a little more or a little less, and all this depends on the variety of constitutions and other conditions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap heals slowly, but it often causes considerable attrition (or wearing away).
But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a wound, and on this everything depends with regard to sensation (or feeling).
And its restoration is thus: that which is broken of its parts should be aligned with splints until it is rejoined and united as much as possible by setting, easing (or manipulation), and fabrication (or splinting).
Then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you need one; and bind it above with a bandage appropriate to it.
And then consider all the measures which we have recommended in other fractures, such as a hot poultice and similar things, so that every accident is countered with what is suitable for him until he is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the restoration of a leg fracture.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is large, and is called by the name of the tibia (shinbone); and the other is slender, and is called the fibula.
And the same types of fractures occur to each of these bones as occur in the two bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and its operation is the same.
And if the two bones are broken together, the leg is deformed in all parts.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is deformed in the front parts.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it below, and it is among those things that are not easily seen/revealed to you.
Then administer extension, setting (reduction), and bandaging of the splints according to that same manner/method.
However, if the leg fracture is large, having many splinters, the extension should be less and gentler, and relieve it with your skill.
And in the leg, there is a certain method of operation similar to that on the arm. When you align the splints and complete your operation, you will then take pieces of pine wood, which are placed under the bandages that are applied in layers, and are usually made of palm branches; choose those of small thickness, and not the thin ones, and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the very bottom.
Then wrap each one in two cloths, according to its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side, from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then bind the two splints in three places: at both ends and in the middle. For with this binding, the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and remains in a good position.
And now a small wooden splint, according to the length of the leg, has been applied; and let the leg be placed on it so that it conserves its position.
And especially you should do this in a fracture, and when there is an open wound.
Then examine the leg each day and study it carefully, and watch it for abscesses, inflammation, or other similar problems; and if any of these problems occur, then treat it as necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the talus and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the whole talus does not often occur; but fractures of the bones of the foot do occur sometimes; and fractures of the toes rarely occur, and only attrition (wear) occurs to them in cases of ill-disposition (i.e., poor alignment or healing).
And if a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot and sometimes those bones are elevated above each other, then have the patient place their foot on the ground prepared as before.
Then place one foot on what is elevated among those bones, and then press down on those bones, and squeeze them until they return to their places.
Then apply a plaster and tow over it, and place under the sole of the foot a small board to which two flat pieces are attached.
Then bind that tightly to the foot with a descending bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other necessary things.
And when three or four days have passed, then untie the bandage, for you will find the bones joined, whether they were broken or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if some say they are broken, then restore those, and join them as I have recounted to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then apply a splint to the broken finger according to its length, and let it be a little longer than the finger; and place under the foot that board which I have mentioned to you, and bind it with a proper bandage.
But if what is broken of the bones is two or three or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its size wrapped in linen cloth, and bind the board to the bottom of the foot, and let it rest on one of the ends of the board beyond the belly of the foot so that it holds it with good retention.
And it is convenient for you that you do not forget to consider all the things which I have told you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose yourself to every accident with what is suitable.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the woman's hip and of the pubic bone and of the man's penis.
When the hip of the woman is broken, then make her lie down on her back, and gently incline her towards one side, and let her be held from behind.
And then the midwife fills the hip with cotton, and it should be made into a ball in her hip; and then the woman should be held, and her buttocks raised little by little, because all this is useless until the broken part of the hip is positioned as a ball and the broken bone returns to place.
And then place powders on her buttocks, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and let her urinate, and reduce and reposition it according to the manner in which you initially placed it, and then return it to its first position.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it will be healed.
And if you wish, take a pig's bladder and attach a reed tube to its opening; and introduce the entire bladder into her hip, and then inflate it through the tube until the bladder is inflated inside the hip, for this will help the fracture to set.
And then it should be filled with cotton and remain in place for several days, as we have recommended, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the pubis of a man or woman is fractured, then administer for its restoration and healing what we have recommended for a hip bone fracture.
And that which is right is not hidden in these nearby fractures which happen infrequently, especially to one who studies and uses and understands this my book well; for that fracture indicates to you the best methods in its restoration and setting, and therefore understand well.
But in the case of a fractured penis, take the neck of a goose, and place the penis within it; and then place a cloth bandage over it, and let it be wrapped, and then let it remain for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
It is advisable for one who suffers a fracture with a wound, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar, that you carefully attend to and bleed them immediately if the conditions for phlebotomy indicate it as we have said above.
And if the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary that you attend to stopping it so that you sprinkle crushed egg whites on it, if no other cause presents itself.
And then begin to set the fracture on that same day, and do not delay this, unless an abscess forms.
But if a hot abscess forms, then you should delay setting it until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, uncovered, then it is necessary that you carefully reduce it and align it with your hands easily and with little extension.
But if extension is not prepared for you and the alignment of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight fingers, and the width of which is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the physician to have three or four of these, according to the amount needed for this in the treatment of every kind of fracture.
And let it be round, and let it be of little thickness so that it is not bent by the pressure on it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp end which has a margin at its ends; and let the upper part of it be of increasing thickness, and from the middle of it to the parts (i.e., the handle).
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem," that is, a small spatula.
Therefore it is necessary that the sharp end of it be placed raised above the end of the prominent bone.
And push that in at once until the bone returns, and it is held with some kind of bandage.
Then strive to bind the ends of the fracture together, and if the broken end of the bone is thin and does not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary that you incise the end of that bone until the instrument can grasp it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recommended, then incise it with whatever is suitable from the incisors which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whichever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient finds vehement and persistent pain, then know that the bone is not returned to its natural place; and then do this, because you will provide the patient great relief.
When your restoration of the bone is complete, then submerge a cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place on the wound a cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption.
And then administer stitches at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you may incise the hole with forceps and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And take great care not to constrict the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish physicians have done this, and it caused the death of their patients or a corrosive illness or suppuration, that is, gangrene. And if your constriction is light, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have recounted, and you find pain in the area, then it is not fitting that you place stitches there, but apply a bandage of stiff cloths instead of stitches and bind it tightly with them.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to suppurate, then remove the cloth which you had placed over it with wine, and then apply poultices, ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is necessary for you to unbind the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed, and it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down from it easily.
If many days pass and the wound is not healed nor is the pus discharged from it, then know that there are small pockets of pus, for which it is necessary to explore the wound with a probe. And of those pockets of pus, those that are separated, remove and extract them; those that are not separated and press on the limb and cause pain, you must incise them as far as is possible for you.
And if a swelling or ulcer occurs in the wound—that is, an abscess, or another type of corruption and putrefaction—then it is necessary to treat each one of these with what is appropriate from the treatment which is described in its chapter.
And this is what my discourse should be about and you should take note: when a large bone is fractured, elevate the limb, such as the bone of the thigh and hip, and similarly for those of the large members, and do not attempt traction or extraction, because many times death results from this; rather, leave it until it suppurates, for it will fall off by itself within about twenty or thirty days; and then treat the wound if it seems necessary to you, but if not, leave it alone.
Chapter 20.
Chapter 20: On the treatment of swelling that occurs in the aftermath of a fracture.
Often this swelling occurs after the healing of a fracture, and especially if it is near the joints, and it distorts the shape of the limb; and it quickly prevents the limb from its natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and administer medicines that have a styptic effect, such as aloe, enses [likely a misspelling or variant of a similar herb], myrrh, cerecloth (or a similar binding material), and acacia, and similar things; so that you take some or all of these, and mix them with styptic wine, or with egg white, or with sour wine, and apply this to the swelling on a cloth, and bind it tightly.
And leave the bandage tight; do not loosen it for many days; then loosen it and apply another, until the swelling is reduced; or bind a thin lead plate over it, because lead has the property of reducing anything swollen in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already become hardened and constricted and necessity requires its removal carefully, then incise it in its most prominent part, and incise the excess and prominence, or scrape it with a sharp instrument until it is reduced; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Chapter 21. Of the restoration of a fracture when it is set and afterwards the limb remains thin and weak, not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is set, and afterwards the limb remains thin and weak, this is caused by many things: one of which is excessive loosening of the ligaments and their binding not as it should be; or by excessive tightness of the bandages so that nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb; or by excessive superfluous embrocation; or by excessive movement not at the proper time; or by a deficiency of blood in the patient's body and by weakness of the patient.
And the cure for this is to give the patient nourishing food and to make his heart cheerful so that his blood is increased; and administer baths; and introduce joy and gladness to him.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continue embrocation with warm water, until nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Chapter 22. Of the treatment of fractured bones when they are set crookedly and the proper operation is prevented.
When, in a limb already healed from a fracture, there is a crookedness and prominence at the fractured bone and swelling, and because of this a deformity of the limb, but nevertheless the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not accept the word of someone who claims that limb is newly fractured.
But there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land; and this operation is very blameworthy, leading to great fear, the sign of which is mortal.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed with lukewarm water in which softening herbs are boiled, such as mallow leaves and roots, melilot, and similar things; and a softening plaster should be applied, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of mallow root should be made and mixed with white clay or olive oil, and applied as a plaster; or ripe figs should be crushed with pigeon dung, and similar things from among the medicines named above for consolidation.
And sometimes it is resolved with frequent, gentle friction with moist hands, and movement of the limb in every direction should be administered at all times.
But if the crookedness has become established and is strong and has turned to bone, and it becomes necessary to treat it with iron, then the excess should be removed, and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and that which superfluously swells with the bone should be incised with fine scalpels, and relief should be provided with care and skill.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the treatment of dislocations.
A dislocation is the displacement of one of the joints from its place, whereby movement is prevented, the shape of the limb is distorted, and great pain and injury are caused to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs in someone, then it is necessary to strive immediately that it be reduced, and not delay that reduction, because if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and very quickly the reduction of the dislocation is made difficult.
And for this reason, it should not be moved or stretched at the time of inflammation, because many times it causes spasms and excruciating pains.
But when this happens, then you must attend to the phlebotomy of the patient, and then let it rest until the inflammation subsides; and then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated with that which will bring back its proper function.
And I have now ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what preceded in fracture; from the uppermost part of the body to the lowermost part.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated, it will not be long; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are moved from their places by slight displacement, and are slightly softened; or they are dislocated by complete and total dislocation, until they are softened at the point of the joint, until the saliva of the patient flows and he cannot hold it nor close his mouth, and his tongue is impeded in its speech.
But when his dislocation is slight, then in most instances it returns by itself with little intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, then it is necessary that reduction be administered to him lightly, and not delayed at all.
And it is so that the assistant holds the head of the patient, and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw inside his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he inserts both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands are outside with which he pulls; and he commands the patient to relax his jaws and allow them to be moved from each side; and the physician pulls the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer evaporation with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easier and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And then, when they are returned and pulled together, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place on them powders of cloth with cerate, and it should be made of wax and rose oil; and then it should be tied lightly with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on his back, and his head should be placed between two pillows, so that it does not lean to the right or left; and do not force him to chew anything; before his food should be softened, until when the pains are reduced and the jaws are knitted, then let him eat what he wants.
And this should be administered with ease, and he should not work on opening his mouth during eating and drinking and speaking, until the jaw is knitted and healed.
And if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time and are not returned to their places, then many times fevers and continuous thirst occur, and the patient's belly is easily bloated, and he easily vomits pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is perilous; and many times he for whom this happens dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and of the extremity of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated inwards because of its connection with the ribs; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is evident to the touch.
And its restoration is that the patient lie on his back and extend his arms. Then constrict the area with your palm with firm compression, for it will return.
Then place a plaster and powders on that and bind it tightly.
But the extremity of that which is the elbow and is continuous with it, is not dislocated in any way; then it should be reduced and bandaged according to what we have said and according to what is available to you.
Then place a plaster, powders, and a bandage on it, and instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until it is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that a muscle is dislocated in only three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated from the upper part of the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated in the back parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in the front parts by the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and protrudes outwards in the lower parts below the armpit, and especially in those whose flesh is thin, it is easily dislocated; but in those in whom there is much flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And it quickly happens to some men through a blow or fall, and their muscle is inflamed by a hot abscess, and it is believed to be dislocated because of this.
Then it is necessary that you examine this carefully before anything else, and then you proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts below the armpit; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, because you find a manifest difference between them; and you find in the head of the muscle a concavity and below the armpit, towards the touching of the head of the muscle, like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it through all movements.
If it is dislocated below the feet or above, and you then find a clear protrusion, and it is not hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easily done when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises the patient's hand to the upper parts; and then places his hands below the patient's armpit, and raises the joint firmly upwards to its place, and the minister raises the patient's hand and extends it upwards; and then places it below because it returns lightly.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and from the beginning that the dislocation happened, many days pass, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water and a poultice be applied that softens and lubricates, such as boiled roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be applied.
And then the patient should be supine on his back and a wool pad be placed under his armpit, that is equally between softness and firmness, and then the physician places his heel on the pad, and raises the head of the muscle with force, and pulls the patient's hand so that it is not moved downwards, and another minister holds the patient's head, so that it is not moved downwards, for then it immediately returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: it is that you have present a man who is taller than the patient, and stands on that side, and inserts his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises the patient's armpit to the upper parts until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the patient's hand from the lower parts of his belly. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down, for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reduced easily according to another method: and it is that a long wooden post be fixed in the earth, the head of which is round in shape, like a pestle of a mortar, that is neither thick nor thin, and then it is placed under the patient; after being placed on top of the post soft cloths, and the patient is standing according to the length of the post, and then his hand is extended downwards on the other side; and his body is stretched on the other side with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
And if its reduction is difficult for all the reasons we have said, then use this treatment: and it is that you take a stick the length of which is two braccia, and its width is four digits, and its thickness is lessened at the end near the armpit according to this form:
And then soft cloths are tied around the round head so that the stick does not injure the patient.
And then it is placed under the armpit of the patient, and the hand or arm is extended over the stick down to the lower parts, and the stick is tied over the shoulder and arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a rung of a ladder according to its width, and the hand is extended to the lower parts, and the rest of the body is suspended on the other side, for the joint enters immediately.
And when its entry is complete in whatever way possible for you, then you should place under the armpit a ball of wool of equal size; and then apply a plaster prepared from powdered comfrey and egg white over the entire muscle, as it is rolled up, and then tighten it under the armpit with a decent bandage; and the bandage should be rolled over the plaster, and his hand tied to his neck, and left, and his hand should not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's food be limited until the limb is strengthened, because it is easier for its healing.
And then the food should be gradually increased to seven or five, and movement should be exercised; and then if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity affecting it or another cause, then cautery with three punctures should be administered to it, as previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is untied and the joint is not fixed, and the plaster and the bandage are applied to it several times, and it is not fixed and it falls and he cannot raise that arm to the upper parts, then know that his nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are either cut or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Regarding the dislocation that occurs between the foot and the ankle or the rear parts, the reduction is done with impulse and extension with the hands, until it returns [to its place].
And let another bandage be applied to that [area], and cure it until it is healed.
And if heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement occur near the healing, then the patient should use baths many times until that heaviness is alleviated and it returns to its former nature.
Chapter 27.
On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, but mostly forward and backward.  The dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is evident to the sight or touch, depending on how it is dislocated. When you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one, this is manifestly clear to you, for the joint is hollowed and cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch its muscle with it.
And it is necessary that you take care, and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess develops, for if a hot abscess develops, its reduction is difficult, and it is not easily healed completely; and especially when it is in the backward parts, for it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and more painful, and often causes death with it.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's hand should be extended with two hands, and his arm expanded, and the doctor's hands should be on and under the elbow, and he should pull the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the forward parts, then return it thus: bend the hand with your hand, until you strike the elbow with the root of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer strong and very forceful extension.
And it is so that two assistants extend the arm, and two other assistants hold that extension so that it is not moved during the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, after it is wrapped in a long doubled cloth over his hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint that hand with some oil so that it may lubricate the joint more easily; and then push the joint with strong pressure until it returns [to its place].
And after the reduction, it is necessary that he be placed upon a plaster which has styptic and drying properties with egg white, and it should be bound tightly with a descending bandage, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left like that for some days.
And then it should be unbound; and then if the joint is formed in its place, then you untie his bandage and leave it so.
And if you see the joint not well bound, then you repeat the plaster and bandage, and leave it for some days until it is constricted; and then unbind it.
But if it happens that there is pain after the reduction of the joint, and his disposition is towards movement, then administer moistening in a bath and gentle friction, and compression, until he is relieved; or place on the joint an emollient, that is, something very greasy; and then it should be bandaged, and left on the bone day and night. And then remove that, and put it in a bath; and when it is dry, then you rub the joint with a temperate friction, and then again apply the emollient, that is, very greasy ointment, once, and a second time, and a third time. with the aid of a bath, until it is cleansed.
And if you wish, place on it a warm, moist cow's bladder, and bind it tightly; and do this several times, for it is moistening and reduces [the swelling] to its proper state.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated wrist, that is, of the joint that is between the arm and the hand.
A dislocated wrist is sometimes easily reduced, unlike other joints; however, speed is necessary in its reduction at the time it is dislocated, before the area becomes inflamed or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's wrist joint on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and the physician places his hand or palm on the prominence of the joint and manipulates it until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered whether the palm is already facing the belly of the hand; then the patient places the back of his hand on a table during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is toward the back of the hand, then let the position of the hand be face down on the table so that the physician's hand can fall upon that prominence of the joint.
And so if it returns immediately, it is good; but if not, then compress it with a poultice to reduce the inflammation and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, you will not be able to manage or achieve its reduction once several days have passed.
However, if the joint remains twisted and causes the patient no pain, only that the hand is weakened and cannot grasp anything, then know that the nerves are pinched or bruised, and then there is no remedy except to cauterize near the injury and quickly apply a bandage.
Therefore, when the arm is reset, then apply the poultice we have described, and let it be applied and held for five days; then let it be unwrapped and left, and let the patient exercise their hand.
But if its movement is impeded and some heaviness occurs, then soothe it with warm water and friction several times, until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in every part.
And when one of those fingers is dislocated towards the back of the palm or the belly of the hand, then stretch the finger and gently push the dislocation back with your fingers until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger and hang it downwards from the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened on that same day.
And when night comes, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is tight [or strong/firm].
And do similarly if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform this your first operation until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter 30.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation happens to one of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are dislodged from their places, then in that case there is no cure, for death threatens the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excrement is expelled involuntarily, and he cannot retain it; and many times some of his limbs are paralyzed, either both legs or both arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is dislocated, for many times it is dislocated and many times the dislocation occurs in four parts.
Therefore, that is dislocated in the posterior parts and is called paralysis.
But the treatment for him is that you then consider if the paralysis comes from a fever, because then in that case there is neither cure nor complete healing of it.
But in that which comes from a fall or from a blow or similar causes, the Ancients already described the methods of cure with lengthy discourses, of which the most returns with profit; but I have already abbreviated that, of which the little excuses the excess of it, for my nearness to my intended explanation, with which I have expounded and formed this from diverse instruments of that with which I will show this and expound that.
And of those, only that which occurs in the two properly is cured, with what I have recounted.
And it is that the patient be extended on his face on a soft, even surface near a wall, and a soft, thick mattress be placed beneath him so that his feet are not hurt.
And then a straight pole should be placed, fixed in the earth at the head end of the bed near the patient's head, and another pole near his feet at the other end of the bed.
And the assistant should hold the pole, and it should not be fixed in a pit; and another assistant should hold the other one in the same manner.
Then wrap a bandage around the patient's head and below the armpits, firmly; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole which is near his head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage around his hips, his buttocks, and his legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other pole which is near his feet.
Then each assistant should extend the bandages to the part of the pole, and the two poles and the bandages should not be removed from the places in which they are fixed, but nevertheless they should not be fixed as we have said before. (The last phrase likely refers to a previous instruction not to rigidly fasten the poles, implying some degree of adjustability)
And the physician should place his palms on the spine with strength until it returns to its place, or place a board on it, and then adjust his feet on the board until it returns to its place. (The "it" refers to the spine.)
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board whose width or length is about three cubits, and make a hole in the wall which we have said is near the patient, into which the end of the board will fit. Then place half of the board on the spine, and the physician should place his feet on the other end, and press firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you wish, use a drill that is turned by hand; and you should place in the ground below the patient's head at the back of the buttocks two poles, whose length is one cubit, and below their head at the back of the buttocks, similarly two poles; and the distance between each pole should be one palm, and there should be a hole in each pole in which the drill fits, and each should be firmly fixed in the ground so that it is not moved.
And there should be another round pole in which the drill is, and it should be revolved in the two holes of the two poles.
And at its end is a hole into which the pole is fitted, the length of which is one palm together with that which is revolved; and in the two other poles it is similar to that.
Then tighten the ligatures that you have tied to the patient's feet in the hole that is under their head, and the ligatures that you have tied to their thighs in the drill that is under their feet.
And then, beside each drill, let a minister stand who turns the drill with his hand, and the physician sets the vertebrae as we have said.
Then, once the vertebra is returned and the location is set, you should apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then lint; and then place over the plaster a piece of linen cloth whose width is three fingers or thereabouts, and its length is sufficient to cover the swollen area and the part of the healthy vertebra.
Then it should be bound with the ligature we have mentioned, and the patient should be given light nourishment until healed.
And if any swelling remains at the end of the healing, then medicines should be administered that soften and smooth, with the application of the linen cloth for a long time, which we have recommended; and a lead plate is then applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the area behind the spinal vertebrae, and is caused by that dislocation; and that is a bone which already swells, so that no attempt should be made to treat it with this medicine, for it will very quickly cause death.
Chapter 31.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint suffer only dislocation, and not what happens to other joints of small movement and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards.
And a sign of its dislocation inwards is that, when you compare the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg is longer and the knee more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot without pain.  And it is in this location that a hot abscess usually appears, because the head of the femur has already arrived there.
And the sign of that which happens in dislocation outwards is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms [described above].
And the sign of dislocation forwards is that when he extends his leg fully, nevertheless he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he forces himself to walk, he cannot do so forward; and his urine is retained, and his groin is swollen, and he walks on his heel.
And a sign that dislocation has occurred backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it forward before bending the hip, and his leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is behind that location.
Furthermore, regarding the reduction of these types of dislocation, you should consider that if the dislocation is old and chronic, and has already become fixed, and you attempt reduction and it remains in its displaced position, then it is not curable completely; and therefore, no attempt should be made in such a case.
But in a case where the dislocation is recent, and is one of the four types of dislocation, then take care to return the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, for it will return very easily and will require no other treatment.
But, if it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part, either with his hands or with a bandage which is tied above the knee; and another assistant should extend the thigh from above such that he places his hands under the patient's testicles; and then tighten a strong bandage around the thigh bone, and let another assistant hold the end of the bandage taut.
And let the extension be from the inside of the groin to the furcula (presumably the perineum), or from the back to the buttocks.
And let the extension of all those [assistants] be at once, until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and hangs suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four [types of dislocation].
And therefore, if the dislocation is reduced with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for each type [of dislocation] that which we will say concerning its own cure.
In the reduction of the hip itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the patient be supine on his sound side; and then place the ligaments on the root of the thigh in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the place below the groin; and then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the highest part of the furcula (perineum).
And then another strong assistant grasps his arms, and raises the thick part of the affected thigh and extends it outwards with a vehement extension, for in that way it returns to its place.
And this type is of easier cure, with which this member is reduced, than the other types.
But if it is dislocated upwards and does not yield to treatment with this type of cure at all, then it is necessary that the patient's two feet be tied together with a strong, light bandage, above both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each (bandage) be the quantity of four digits, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two digits.
And then the patient should be suspended by the head from a pole, and let him be inside the house; and let his height from the ground be the quantity of two arms' lengths.
And then command a strong young man to gently lower the head of the thigh, and let another young man be suspended with the patient, and the other young man, gently but firmly pulling, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, as we have recommended in the case of coldness; and let the bandage be tightly applied to the affected leg and to his feet.
And then two poles should be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head; and then let adjusted poles be placed in the middle of the elevation (or hump/ridge) upon which wet cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed by the pole being between his thighs, lest the extension to the lower parts is pulled.
And then each assistant extends to their part, and the physician with his hand completes the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the anterior parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and it is according to this same narration on a bolster; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the dislocated joint, and then compresses that with the other hand, and with that compression he places that which is extended to the lower parts to the part of the knee.
And if the dislocation is in the posterior parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended to the lower parts, and he is elevated above the ground; rather it is necessary that he be placed on something hard, just as it is necessary for the elevation if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about his lying on two cushions; and it is upon his face, and the ligaments being extended, as we have said, there is not much difficulty.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a tablet (or splint) on the place where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is accomplished as it should be — and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see them equal and the patient draws his leg and extends it without difficulty, then you know that the member is returned as it should be — and then you adjust the two thighs and apply a plaster and bind it so that the hip is not moved in any direction; and let the patient remain at rest for three or four days.
And then untie the bandage and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then you know that the dislocation is now healed, and then allow the patient to go.
And if you see any cause for softening (or loosening), then you return and plaster that, and bind it according to your first binding, and leave it for three days.
And then untie it, and have him walk about gradually for some days, until he is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, and inwards, and downwards more towards the back; and it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply his leg to his thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration for all its types is that you make the patient lie down straight, so that he extends his leg as much as possible on that; adhere your two hands to his face, and place his foot between your feet; then make his knee adhere to your palms, and hold those between your fingers on his knee with firmness, and another attendant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that his leg adheres to the thigh easily and without difficulty.
And then plaster that and make the leg adhere to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for some days, until he is healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction is difficult for you, then administer strong extension with bandages, the use of which in the treatment of the hip was previously described.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the talus (ankle bone).
The talus is sometimes dislocated by a slight movement, and sometimes completely dislocated, and its dislocation is either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the talus swells, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its slight dislocation is easy reduction; it is that it should be extended easily with the hands and manipulated until it returns (to its place).
But in treating it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient lie down straight, and that a strong and capable assistant hold him from behind at the middle of his back.
Then you, with your right hand, take the foot from the uppermost part, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the ankle.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left, twice, and then extend it with the left; and gently push the toes of the foot with your right hand towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice, as we have described.
And then, a third time, gently push the toes of the foot towards the leg, and you will be at the ankle.
Then it will return in one or two times according to this method, and if you see the foot straightened, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, for it will return.
But if the reduction by the method we have described is forbidden to you, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly tie a strong cloth to the ground, so that it falls between their thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around them so that it does not hurt the patient.
And then let the patient's attendant hold their thighs, and let another attendant extend the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied around the ankle; and then let each attendant extend against the extension of their partner, and let the cloth remain between the patient's thighs, restraining it, so that their body is not pulled downwards against their extension.
And then the physician sets the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh downwards, because the dislocation easily returns.
And so when the dislocation returns and the success of its reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And you must be careful or wary of the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage over it is not too tight and severely damages them.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is loosened, tighten it.
And then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be loosened and corrupted, and then it will not receive a cure.
And if a hot abscess happens to him, then you must administer to its reduction that which we described earlier, in the place of a cure and embrocation, until it is healed.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocations of the toes.
It is necessary that the dislocated [toe] be bandaged with slight extension without effort; and this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
But if the dislocation is in one of the bones of the foot, then you must make the patient place his foot on level ground or on a table, and he should be positioned as if walking.
And then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from the joint, and then press down on that with your foot firmly until it returns, and you see that it is now bandaged and no prominence appears in that place.
Then place under the patient's foot a board that supports the entire foot, to which two ends are attached, and then tighten it with a decent and firm bandage for three days; and then untie it and have the patient rest from walking for many days, until it is firm and its reduction is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that are made with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When any of those causes occur, and you exert yourself in its cure and in the restoration of the patient, death often ensues.
And therefore it is not fitting that anyone presume upon the cure except one who is wise in the art, of long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not rash nor presumptuous; and that he use in the beginning medicines that reduce hot abscesses only, and leave the patient to divine judgment, except for one in whom you hope for salvation from peril, with alleviation of the disease, and in whom some hope appears. And then exert yourself immediately to reduce it at the beginning of the cause, before a hot abscess develops.
And then if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen which reduces hot abscesses and treat the wound with what is suitable for it of drying ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and the jagged ends of the bone are separated, then you must force their alignment, and do in this what we have said in the simple illnesses that precede this in those locations.
And guard and avoid, according to your virtue, that entry into the paths of fear as my preaching has preceded you; for this is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more salutary to your true body in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
