of hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds:
either they are inside the anus, like a grain of resin, and there are small and large ones, and blood constantly flows from them, and there is one or more, and they are outside the anus and at the end of the anus;
but those that are outside have little moisture, and constantly leak a little yellow water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the treatment for those who have them inside the anus is that you instruct the patient to strain while going to the toilet, so that the anus protrudes, and the threads appear;
then hurry, and grasp it with forceps, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, grasp them with a cloth, or with cotton, or with a piece of chamois;
and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and powder over them some hot powders that act as a cautery;
or you cauterize them as described in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until healed;
and if the rectum cannot protrude, give the patient a biting and harsh enema to cleanse what is in the rectum, so that it can come out clearly;
When the patient strains, and if the threads are far from the anus, then the treatment is easy;
and you take them with your fingernail or with tweezers, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until healed, and so they avoid the incision by iron.
You must administer the suture in this manner:
take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread over and make the needle pierce the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and it should be wide;
and tighten the thread firmly, then knot the thread, and pull out the needle, and do this with all the others, and leave one to drain the excess blood;
then put on the wound a cloth moistened with rose oil or cerate, and put it on the wound, and tell the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they have fallen off, then treat them with ointment and other treatments, until they are healed.
of the drying of the excrement or anus/rectum
Many times drying of the excrement occurs in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use.
So you must scrape the bark from the surface with the tip of a spatula or your fingernail, which prevents it from moistening;
then treat it until it is consolidated as it should be;
and if it cannot consolidate, then repeat the scraping more forcefully than before, until it heals well, and is excoriated/raw;
then treat it until it is healed.
