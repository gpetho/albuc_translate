of the fleshy growth which is called "thelul" (a fleshy growth or polyp)
When you cut the fleshy growth, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then place it, burning hot, on the cut fleshy growth; and keep your hand there until the cautery reaches the base of the vein from which the blood flows; do this once or twice, and if there are many fleshy growths, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards treat them with beneficial ointments until they are healed; and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the ischium, it will be more helpful.
