Chapter 19:
On the restoration of bone fractures with wounds.
It is suitable for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large like the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar, that you act quickly and perform bloodletting immediately if the conditions for bloodletting justify it as we have previously mentioned.
And if the wound is bleeding, then you must quickly stop it by sprinkling powdered chalk on it if you have no other remedy available.
And then begin to restore the fracture on the same day, and do not delay this unless an abscess occurs.
But if an abscess occurs, then delay the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not approach it on the third or fourth day at all, as this could cause bad complications.
But if the broken bone is protruding through the skin, then you must forcibly reduce and align it with your hands gently and with minimal extension.
But if the extension and alignment cannot be done with your hands alone, then reduce it with this instrument; it is an iron tool, seven or eight fingers long and its width according to the size of the wound; and it is necessary for the physician to have three or four of these according to what is needed for the treatment of each type of fracture.
And it should be round and slightly thick so that it does not bend under compression during the operation.
And it should have a sharp end with a margin at the extremities; and its upper part should be of increasing thickness from the middle towards the ends.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek “labre volentz atelarem”, which means small spatula.
So the sharp end should be placed over the protruding end of the bone.
And push it in one movement until the bone returns, and it is aligned properly.
And then strive to align the fracture ends together, and if the broken end is thin and does not accept the instrument well, then you must incise the end of that bone until the instrument can hold it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recommended, then incise it with a suitable instrument as we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away the remaining roughness and small scales from the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, if the patient experiences severe pain afterwards, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do this because you will give the patient great relief.
When you have completed the restoration of the bone, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place a plaster or anything containing oil on the wound, so that it does not cause rot and corruption.
And then apply splints during the completion of the bone restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you can make incisions with scissors and use wrappings according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to tighten the wound with the fracture, as many foolish doctors have done this, causing their patients death or corroding disease or severe inflammation.
And let your bandaging be light, soft, and different from the bandaging of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a severe wound, and you fear any of the bad complications we have mentioned, and you find pain in the area, then you should not place splints over it, but wrap it with hard cloths instead of splints and secure it with them.
And after a day or two when the wound starts to form a scab, then remove the cloth you placed over it with wine, and then apply dressings and ointments with which we usually treat wounds, like tetrapharmacum ointment and similar ones.
And you must loosen the bandage and examine the wound every day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and firm, and the limb must be positioned in such a way that any rot drains away from it easily.
If many days pass and the wound is not consolidated and the scab has not separated from it, then know that there are small fragments which you must search for in the wound with a probe.
And remove and extract those fragments that are separated, and for those that are not separated and are causing pain and inflammation, you must incise them as much as is possible for you.
And if the wound develops pus or discharge, such as abscesses, or any other type of corruption and putrefaction, then you must treat each of them with the appropriate remedies whose treatment has been previously described in its chapter.
And this is where my discourse must stay and you present your practice: when a large bone is broken, protruding over the limb like the thigh bone or the humerus and similar large limb bones, do not presume to pull or extract it because this often causes death; instead, leave it until it decays, as it will likely fall off by itself in around 20 or 30 days; and then treat the wound if you see fit, and if not, leave it alone.
