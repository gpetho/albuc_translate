Chapter Two.
Incision of the two arteries behind the ears known as the hissing ones.
When someone experiences acute episodes affecting the eyes or the chest, and this becomes chronic, and drug treatment is ineffective, the most effective treatment in this case is the incision of these two arteries.
So, if you want to incise them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the artery appears, then tie the patient's neck with the edge of his garment, then look where the vessel pulsates, and their two locations are the two lowered areas behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with the lancet to the bone, and that should be across the head, and if you wish, insert the lancet from under the artery and lift it upwards by cutting, and the length of the cut should be about two closed fingers.
For when the vessel is severed, the blood comes out in a pulsating gush, spurting forward with repeated spurts.  If the artery does not appear to the touch, then you should measure about three fingers from the ear, then mark with ink and incise to the bone, and what is necessary is to...
Let six ounces of blood flow, on average, and perhaps you will let more or less than that, all according to what you see of the patient's strength and the fullness of his arteries. Then look at the wound, and if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it away.
So that a hot swelling does not occur, then pack the wound with a wick of linen cloths, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
