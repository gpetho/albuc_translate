When moisture prevails over the channels of the lung, especially when it comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be emptied by purgative medicines; afterward make a cautery at the root of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat, and burn only a little of the core. Afterward make another cautery at the junction of the neck to the top of the spine, and let the cautery be called "clavile" whose shape we mentioned earlier; and treat the area as we mentioned earlier until healed.
