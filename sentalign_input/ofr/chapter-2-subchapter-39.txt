of the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I have said in the section, by the application of medicines; and when this is not effective, then look in the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have pressed down their tongue with the instrument I told you about.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps that are suitable for this.
And if this is not effective, then take a horsehair rope and put it in the patient's throat, then place a hot iron on the end of the rope, and do this often.
And have the patient abstain from water all day.
Then take a glass full of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with your hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it will fall off. 
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the patient with asafoetida, with the instrument that I mentioned in the fumigation of the uvula; do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot with live coals in it, and the pot should be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in this hole should be the head of the instrument; then throw your fumigation in it, and the patient puts the end of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech; and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation many times; and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and bitter things, and do not drink water; and then it will be necessary for it to come out by this treatment.
And the form of the instrument with which one extracts the leech, is, when one can see it, similar to curved tongs designed to enter the throat; and it should resemble the beak of a heron, and have a roughened surface from a file, so that what it grips, it cannot let go; and here is the form:
