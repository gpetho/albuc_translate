He said, 'This book was completed for you, O children of Bani, as a part of science in medicine, and its goal was achieved in it through clarity and clarity. I saw that I should complete it for you with this explanation, which is a part of the work done by hand.'
Because manual work is valued in our country and time, lacking precision has nearly caused the science to be studied and its effects to disappear. But it remains in written form in the books of the early ones, who recorded their handwriting and the errors and blunders of their drawings until they exhausted their meanings and wasted their benefits.
I saw that I should revive it and write this explanation in it through clarification and explanation and condensation, and I came to see the images of the tools and other instruments of work because it increases clarity and shows what is needed for it.
The reason why there is no skilled craftsman with his hand in our time is because the craft of medicine is long and it is suitable for its owner to retreat before that in the science of dissection, which was described by Galen. Until it stands on the advantages of the organs and their contents, their states and separations, knowledge of the bones and nerves and muscles and number of them and their openings and their closure and their outlets and their places of exit and their outlets.
Therefore, Ibn Al-Nafis said that many physicians were called doctors by name, but few in fact, especially in the craft of the hand, and we have mentioned some of them from this book.
For he who did not know anatomy as we have mentioned it, did not fall into the mistake of killing people with it as I have often seen many who imagine and claim to know it without any knowledge or skill.
And I saw a physician ignorant of anatomy who cut open a goat's head and inserted some of its tendons into the neck of a woman, causing her to bleed to death between his hands.
I also saw a physician who, after a man had stabbed another in the chest with a large knife, removed the piece of gallbladder and replaced it with a piece of the testicle. The man died after three days, and I was about to remove the piece, when I found that the bone of the wound was already decayed and could not be removed.
I also saw a physician who was sought after by some of the rulers of our country for his knowledge of medicine.
A slave of Ethiopian descent had a fracture in his thigh near the knee with a wound, and the physician, using his knowledge, closed the fracture over the wound with screws and clamps, closing it tightly and leaving no opening for the wound to breathe.
He then applied the incision to his thigh, leaving it for days and ordering that the stitching not be completed until he had amputated his leg and foot, and had dressed the wound.
He asked her to speed up the stitching, and he found relief and left his pain behind, but unfortunately, corruption had become a habit in the organ and he could not control it.
Corruption continued to plague the organ until it was destroyed.
I saw another doctor remove a cancer from a bone after several days, until the patient's bone became strong again. This is because if the cancer is caused by mixing lead and sulfur, it should not be exposed to iron.
However, if there is a possibility that the entire organ may be affected.
Therefore, O children, it is important for you to learn that the work with your hand is divided into two parts: one part is safe and the other part has pain in most cases.
And she has warned in every place where this book comes, the work that contains deceit and fear, so it is important for you to warn against it and avoid it.
So that the ignorant do not find the path of speech and argument, take care of yourselves with determination and caution, and for the sickness of your patients with care and firmness.
1. Use the best way leading to safety and certain cure. 2. Avoid dangerous diseases.
1. Do not fear what may enter your religion and worldly life, for it remains with you and raises you in this world and the hereafter for your virtues. 2. Avoid what causes harm to yourself and others.
1. It has been said by Galen in some of his sayings, "Do not treat a bad disease, for it will be called by the name of the physician." 2. Do not engage in harmful practices.
1. This article has been divided into three main sections. 2. The article has been segmented into three parts.

The first chapter.
In the vessel.
And before mentioning the operation, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms and in what mood it is used.
And I say that the speech about the benefit and harm of the vessel is a long speech, requiring deep knowledge, hidden secrets, and has been spoken by a group of rulers.
And they differed in it, and their main speech was fear of dilatation.
And I say that the vessel is beneficial in every mood with a material and without a material, and the hot mood without a material and the calm mood without a material.
And the calm mood with a material, they differed in it, and some said that the vessel is beneficial in it and others said against it that the vessel does not suit in a disease that is from heat and cold because the image of the fire is heat and cold.
And it is not possible to cure a hot and cold disease with a hot and cold drug, and those who say against it that the vessel in fire is beneficial for a hot and cold disease that happens in the bones of people. Because when you put the human body and its moisture to the heat of the fire, you burned the human body cold.
I say that because I have experienced this many times, that it is not appropriate for him to imagine this matter except as if he had been anesthetized and had passed through the door of the cavity, having passed through a great struggle. Stand on the difference in moods of people and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
And the rest of the differences, do not fear them and especially the cold, wet diseases, for all the doctors agreed on them and did not differ in the benefit in it.
And know, O my sons, that the treatment of the cavity by fire is superior to that by the burned drug, because the fire is a simple element that does not exceed the function of the organ that has been burned and does not harm another connected organ except a slight damage.
And the treatment of the burned drug may exceed the function of other organs and may cause a disease in the organ that is difficult to treat, and the fire does this out of honor and respect for its element, it does not do this except when it has been wasted.
This has become clear to us through experience in the long service and care of the industry and standing on the facts of the matter.
This is to save time, and not because it does not suit this book, but I have left for you in the fire a mysterious and how-to of doing it in the bodies and denial of diseases with philosophical arguments that refute your opinions.
Know, O sons of mine, that they have differed in the time when the wheat is ripe and made the best time the spring.
And I say that the wheat can be ripe in every time for the reason that the harm caused by the time takes time to gain the benefit that is gained by the wheat. Nor is it that the wheat from a necessary injury, strong and inherited, that does not bear delay for fear of it, which may follow a greater harm than the slowness of the internal harm caused by time.
Nor should you be deceived, O sons of mine, by the general ignorance and inexperience of physicians that the wheat that cures a disease that does not have a return at all makes them abandon the remedy for good.
Nor do you think that the wheat is only like a drug that relieves the mood and dries the moistures that cause the injury.
Except that surgery is preferred over drugs due to the speed of its success, strength of its effect, and severity of its command.
And the disease may return at any time according to the temperament of the patient, strengthening his disease and what pleases his body from the curiosity about it and neglecting himself in acquiring it from food and such as this from the causes.
O Allah, may it not be a disease that is used in surgery, a gentle one and in a part with little curiosity and moisture. Like the cure for pain, and similar to it, it may not return with that pain, and that is in the least.
And as for the general statement that surgery is the last resort, it is a correct saying because they believe there is no benefit from medicine or otherwise after surgery has been performed.
And the meaning is that surgery is the last resort because we used to use remedies in the disease and those medicines did not help, then we used something else, and surgery helped, so this is why surgery is the last resort. Do not rely on general concepts and many unskilled doctors.
It has been mentioned that the gold collar is better than the silver one, but they said that for decorative purposes and the purity of its core, not because it does not cause any harm to the collar itself.
Because I tried that, I found it only does that in some abdomens and the gold collar is better and more preferable than silver, as they said, but if you protect the intestines from fire with gold, you will not know when to protect them according to the shade of gold you want.
Because it quickly cools the body and if you increase it, it becomes more feverish and melts in the fire, so the silver collar became faster and closer to the truth for work, if God wills.
This section on the collar is placed after the head and feet sections to make it easier for the student to find what he wants, if God wills.
The first section.
In the head, there is a single section.
This section helps to remove excess moisture and cold from the brain, which are causes of headaches, frequent nosebleeds from the sides of the nose to the ears, frequent sleep, toothache, and sore throat. For every disease, there is a risk of frostbite, such as frostbite, hypothermia, and cerebral edema, among others.
This image shows the treatment of the patient with the first dose of the easy-to-swallow head medicine for three to four days, according to the strength of the patient and their age and recovery.
Then she orders him to turn his head to the side with the mouse, and then place his hands on his chest.
Then place the middle finger of your hand on his eyelid, so that your middle finger ends in the position made by the thread.
Then apply the ointment of the zinc oxide as shown in the picture.
Remove the bone from the head of the skull or the small piece of cartilage, and raise your hand, or if it was frozen, you can use the same iron or a different one to heat it. Until you see the bone that I mentioned to you, then take something from salt and dissolve it in water, drink from it, place a cloth on the position and leave it for three days.
Then cover his forehead with a wet cloth and leave it until the smoke disappears from the fire, then treat him with the four-drop mercurous chloride to remove it if God wills.
They said that wounds, as long as they remain open, are best and most beneficial.
Some mentioned that the skin should merge with the bone and hold the dressing until some part of the bone burns, then it should be drained after that what burned from the bone, then it should be treated.
Others said that the dressing should be deep until it affects the bone with a strong effect, until it falls from the bone like the heel or small flap, and they claimed that this position will close the wound for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it subsides, and I have not seen these types of dressings except in some people on the path of harm and leaving it with me is best and safe if the head expands when the natural connection is broken as we have witnessed in other organs.
Especially when the head of the patient was weak, the first type of dressing was applied and it was best for me to use it and if God wills, I will apply it.
The second part.
And how about the head as well?
If a chronic headache occurs and it persists for a long time in the patient, and douches, enemas, suppositories, ointments, plasters, and bandages are used, especially if one of the described wounds has been closed, nothing beneficial has resulted from that, so observe. If the head of the heifer was strong in structure and not weak, and it had a severe cold, then another collar would be made above it slightly. Then, a collar would be made around the entire head of the heifer until the hide becomes thin and separates from the bone. And fasten the collar at the end of the heifer's head in the place known as the dewlap, and gently press with your hand, so that the bone does not come out. For the heifer finds this collar painful, unlike the other collars on its head, and I will mention this collar in its place.
It is recommended that the collar around the head and dewlap be more comfortable than the collar around the middle of the head, as shown in this image.
The third section.
How the non-pregnant sister is treated.
If head pain occurs with a headache and spreads to the eye, remove the collar from the heifer with the available drugs for the head and use all the treatments mentioned in the classification of diseases. If that does not relieve the pain, it is on both sides. Either with strong burning drugs or with mercury.
Regarding the treatment of burns, one should take a single clove of garlic, crush it, and cut its sides from both ends, then scrape out the site of pain from the chest, making a wide slit until it becomes a site under the skin that can accommodate the clove of garlic.
After inserting the clove of garlic under the skin, close it with strong threads, leaving it for thirteen days or half a month, then remove the garlic and leave the wound open for two days or a quarter of a day, then cover it.
Cover the wound with a damp cloth until it becomes firm, then treat it with mugwort until it comes out if Allah wills, and if you wish, do this with some of the burning drugs mentioned in the fourteenth article of the burning drugs.
And regarding this case with mercury: The above-mentioned mixture should be protected:
The mixture is called mercury because its head resembles the head of mercury, which contains some tincture and in the middle there is a small piercing.
Then place it on the site of pain, hold your hand, and slightly heat the mercury, until a small part of it burns through the skin, like half of it. Raise your hand to avoid burning the thread located at the bottom of the wound, then dip a cloth in salty water and place it on the site for three days. Then dip the cloth in hot oil and treat it with mustard to see if it can expel, if God wills.
And if you wish this sister's sharp edge to be on the non-flowing side of the dough and to preserve the cuts in this non-frequented sister, especially.
The Fourth Chapter.
In the case of the frequent sister.
If the sister was treated with what we mentioned in the advanced treatment and what we mentioned in the classification of diseases, but the treatment did not help, and I saw from the indication that none of the first two remedies can be used without drugs or fire. It is recommended to protect the sharp sister until it becomes white after learning on the site of the pain with a long nail or similar, and leave your hand once and then pull it until the thread cuts and reaches the bone.
But it is recommended for you to preserve the connection of the joint that moves with the muscle or nerve that moves it, as it can cause inflammation.
Be careful with the hand and neck regarding the bleeding of the cut suture thread, as it may cause inflammation. And especially for those who are ignorant of what is made and have not practiced, they leave the work at its beginning.
And it will come to mention the management of the bleeding side of the suture thread from its place in the book, if God willing, as I saw some cause for this method not to be done.
I saw the body of the calf possible with its head in the middle of the head as we described and treated the wound until it is clean, if God willing.
And if you wish, use the one we mentioned in the chapter of cutting the suture thread with the frame of the screws, as it is better and more effective than this.
Chapter 5.
How to treat ear inflammation.
If there is inflammation in the ear, caused by cold and treated with ointments and all the remedies we mentioned in the division, but the inflammation does not disappear, apply the frame called the point that this picture represents.
Then tie it around the ear after applying it to it, either around all of them or around all of them if the inflammation is in them. After the ear, it should be slightly separated from its origin after learning the position with the gauze and the incision should be about a dozen points in each ear or its direction. Then, treat the positions until the Lord permits.
The Sixth Chapter.
About the Strength.
The strength that is treated by the incision is only of the type that occurs from strangulation, as mentioned in the classification of diseases.
And avoid the type that occurs from joints and nerve irritation.
When this type of strength was treated with incisions, sutures, and bandages, it did not heal, so the cause should be three times. One at the origin of the ear, a little below the gauze, and the third at the junction of the wounds.
Make the incision on the opposite side because relaxation only occurs on the side that is visible.
A picture of the incision that it is healed by being made on the side opposite to the top of the ear below the skull a little and another in the gauze and its length is according to the length of the pain.
The hand of the incision should be removed until it burns half of the skin, this is a picture of the suture and it is a type of scar that was introduced but it is slightly better than this as you see. It is preferred that the clamp be slightly enlarged, then treat the area as described, insha'Allah it will be cleared.
The seventh chapter.
Regarding the persistent cough.
If the cough persisted after treatment as we described and there was no improvement in the patient's condition, and fever did not develop, then apply four remedies. On each side of the head, apply the remedy as we described and also on the back of the head, according to what we mentioned.
The remedy for the cough as we described, and it may also be applied on the patient's mouth, which will be most effective, then treat as we described.
The eighth chapter.
Regarding memory loss.
If the patient has difficulty swallowing, it is preferred that he first drink a large amount of liquid or crushed food for the brain.
Then roll his head completely and place the written script of the bandage on the back of his head, holding it several times, as it will be beneficial.
Do this on the side that we mentioned, as it is beneficial and if not, the patient's fever will be three remedies in the back of his head, starting from the top of his head to the bottom of his neck.
In each case, enlarge the tip and then treat the case as described, if you wish to increase it, and if it is possible for that, then make the middle part wider.
If you wish to increase it, enlarge the corners and then treat them until they are free, and the wreath will be oily as described.
The ninth part.
In the flaying, stretch all the body.
It is preferred that you proceed with the purification of the head by scrubbing and what we mentioned, then loosen the head of the patient, then make the wreath in the middle of the head, on each corner of the head, and on the back of the head.
And three on the temples, for if you stretch the body's relaxation more than that, the patient was possible for that and the disease was chronic and mild, then make four wreaths on the temples of his face. And inform him until the skin burns more of it and raise your hand then treat it as described until it is free, if God wills, and the wreath will be oily.
The eleventh part.
In the case of a fracture.
However, if the fracture is caused by a blow to the head, it is recommended that the patient's brain be treated first with large-bore I.V.s and other treatments mentioned in the classification, if the injury is severe and there is a possibility of administering medication.
And if the patient is a child and cannot tolerate medication, use the enemas and cathartics for the brain beforehand for several days with improvement of his diet.
Then, the patient's head is shaved, and one of the scalpels described in the section is inserted into the center of the head, followed by another one at the back. And on each side of the head, if the patient is strong and there was a possibility, use the scalpels described in the section and relax the body on the pillows of the neck and back, and the incision should be oily on the section that was described.
And if the injury is in a child, make the incision as smooth as possible on this image.
Chapter Twelfth.
In the case of malnutrition.
If the cause of malnutrition is damp and severe inflammation of the scalp, make the incision as described in the section on the scalp.
When the cause of apoplexy is a predilection for darkness and the body of the patient is moist, whatever does not dry its brain is beyond repair in division.
Then relax the patient's head, make a small cone-shaped piece from goose feathers, place it in the middle of his head, and fix it so that it touches all sides. Then take a small piece of old goose fat.
Then heat it gently over the fire until the finger can bear it if inserted into it. Then remove it and place it in the center of the cone and leave it to cool, doing this once a week with all other good treatments until it is cured, if God wills.
And if you wish to sharpen his nails, make them small and many, not to keep your hand in the mortar but to be a preservative, because this kind of gum makes the brain moisten evenly.
Then hang a greasy cloth on his neck or in chicken fat.
The twelfth chapter.
In the water that falls on the eye.
If you notice the beginning of the water falling on the eye with the signs mentioned in division, then the patient should immediately relax his head and dry it from all moisture and heat it in the bath on the fire for days.
Then he passes a ring around the base of the neck, and inserts two loops on both sides of the shoulders if the water begins to flow into both eyes simultaneously, or from one side if it is only in one eye.
Then he cuts all the cords and threads under the skin to make the loops long in length on both shoulders and prevent bleeding.
If I see something of it, cut it at its place with any remedy you can think of and we will come back with wisdom to tie the threads and cut them and prevent bleeding.
And it may be under the bones in the chest two loops long and clear.
The thirteenth chapter.
In chronic sweating.
If the tears were constant and previous to the cords and threads visible on the surface of the head from outside the head and it appeared that this was due to cold, harsh, and severe sneezing, then cut the loop that is described with the water beginning to flow. A loop in the middle of the head, two loops on the shoulders, and two loops under the bones in the chest, if it increased the loop, then a small cut with the cord on both sides of the eye on the shoulder blade.
Chapter Fourteen.
Where to incise the nose.
If treated as we have described in the division and the treatment was unsuccessful, then perform the operation of Albucasis on the third day. Then shave the head and the middle part of the beard with ointment. Then apply the ointment of Muskarai twice on the shoulders under the hair, a little and preserve the thread, do not cut it, this is the image of Muskarai.
Chapter Fifteenth.
Where to relax the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to disease or dryness, apply one of this ointment on the eyelid with this ointment of Halal.
And if you want to apply it on the shoulders, twice on each side, a little above the shoulder blades, between the spines and the length of each ointment is equal to the length of the shoulder.
And do not stretch your hand too much, only as much as the skin burns a third of the skin, and the image of the ointment is on this side.
Chapter Sixteenth.
Where to relax the eyelid.
If the eyelashes turn inward and cover the eye, there are two types in this case. Either by fire or by medicine burned, and as for the former, it commands the surgeon to leave the patient alive if he can prevent the burning until it swells and subsides.
If it is first seen when it is in its bud, it will make the surgeon's eyes wink with a needle lest it move until it blooms and then to lay the head of the surgeon on the stone of the eye and learn on the eyelid of the eye a sign of the shape of a piece of paper.
The beginning of the sign is near the eyelid, then it is placed under the eyelid with a damp cloth in egg white or in the paws of the blue cabbage and then this image is covered with its mold.
Then it is placed on the shape that was learned a little a little in many times until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a piece of paper, becomes visible especially and a sign of your health to see that the eyelid has swollen and the hair has grown from the cheek of the eye.
Raise your hand at that time and leave it for three days, then wrap it with a damp cloth until the scab falls, then treat it with mucus until it is removed if God wills, for something of the hair will return after a while and the eyelid will relax.
Remove the dressing from the area and clean it, as you did before, until the hair returns to its natural position and does not pull the eyelash. As for the burned dressing, it is to order the alyil to leave the scabs until they swell and become even.
Then make a picture of paper Ash from cork and take from the soap that is ready and from the unsoftened toothpaste of each one an ounce or about it, and squeeze them all with a good squeeze and do this with the wrist so as not to dry out. Then spread it on the cork that you made as a paper Ash sheet and place it on the eye single or both and place under the eye a damp cloth in egg white and the alyil's head in your stone.
And place your little finger over the drug and tighten it slightly and you move it every time the alyil feels the heat of the drug because it finds a heat like fire, as long as it finds the heat, leave the drug and move it with your finger hand if the heat disappears then remove the drug and wash the eye with water.
And see if I see the eyelid has risen as it rises when burned with fire or cut, otherwise replace the drug on the position that the drug did not affect and has not dried until your work is complete and the eye closes then place a cloth soaked in oil until the scar disappears.
Then treat it with a mugwort ointment or another similar one until it is clean, and it is preferable for you to be careful even when working so that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye because the liver relaxes after some days and the hair causes something to fall into the eye.
Then prepare the medicine on that spot where the liver relaxed, especially as you did before or first, and then treat it until it is clean, this is a picture of paper ash.
And know that the eyes of people may differ in size, small and large, according to that, so do not be hasty in your judgment, and do not ignore the right way for those who have experience in this craft.
The 17th chapter.
In the Nasir who is displayed in the eye socket.
If you treated the Nasir as we mentioned in the diagnosis of diseases, it did not cure your treatment, so it is preferable that he be on this form.
The attendant orders him to put his head in the hole and hold his head with a servant between your hands, not moving and not shaking his head.
Then place a cloth soaked in egg white or on the eyelids of him, then cover the dough that this resembles.
The excerpt should be translated as follows: "The windpipe of a lion should be dissected from one side where the cartilage is, and if you want it to be flat like a hammer, then it is better for your work, if God wills.
Then the lion's neck should be shortened if it is open and the jaw should be extracted from it, or if it is not open, it should be opened and the jaw should be extracted. Then, you should place the bandage on it, which is a tight covering, and hold onto it until your hand reaches the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the lion's eye towards the nostril so that you do not miss or hurt the patient, and the bandage may fall into the nose and spoil it. If you reach the first bone with your hand, then reapply the bandage again if necessary.
And leave it for three days, then apply a cloth soaked in oil and treat it with the dried ointment until it is clean. If after forty days it has not cleaned, apply the strong medicine until the bone comes out and remove it as it is mentioned in its place, if God wills.
And another way to dissect the lion's neck, some early writers mention it, is to position the lion and then place a thin crutch in the same place.
Place the heavy lead spoon in the wound, hold your hand firmly to prevent movement of the contaminated lead, and preferably place a cloth soaked in egg white or water on the affected eye.
The lead burns the position of the nail and removes it in an extraordinary way, if the nail is removed by what we mentioned in terms of medicine and otherwise, then a nailpoint must be used to push the nail out of its place.
The Eighth Chapter.
In the division of the wound.
The hair often divides the wound, known as the rash, and especially in the faces of children, it often happens, if this rash is treated as we mentioned in the division, then the treatment did not cure and a small sterile gauze was placed on this picture.
The wound should be placed on the gauze of the sterile sponge, then place a bandage on it in the same wound until it reaches the depth of the wound, and then treat it with the qirita until it removes if God wills.
The Ninth Chapter.
In the case of the Naples incident in the mouth.
If the blade or handle of a surgical instrument is broken, it should be cauterized and burned, and then the wound should be treated. However, if the wound does not heal, it is recommended to cover the wound with a dressing as large as possible for the Naples incident.
Then, insert the dressing into the Naples wound and hold your hand until the iron is completely covered with the dressing and the other parts, and do this once or twice, then treat it afterwards as we mentioned in the treatment until it is freed if God wills.
If the material is cut and healed, or if it is not, then the wound must be exposed and the rotten bone must be removed according to what will appear in the opening if God wills.
Chapter 30.
In the case of the wound and the broken surgical instrument.
If the instrument was swollen by moisture and the wound moved and was treated with medicine, but it did not heal, then remove the head of the scalpel from the stone and cover the dressing that comes after this with a bandage after placing the tube on the socket.
Then, insert the dressing into the wound with a spoon and hold your hand slightly until the scalpel feels the heat of fire that has reached the socket's beginning, then lift your hand, and repeat the dressing as you wish, and the scalpel will fill with salt water.
He should wear a watch and blow into it, as the movable abscess confirms and the swollen and inflamed dry wound exudes foul moisture.
The 30th and 40th section.
In which part does the abscess ache?
If the abscess aches before the cold, or if it is hard and did not respond to treatment with drugs, it may be due to either obesity or heat.
And if it is due to obesity, it is to take ghee and put it in a copper pot or a mortar, then take a cloth and rub it on the painful joint until it cools down.
Then repeat this process until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the abscess, and if you want to wrap a stone or cloth in cold ghee and place it on the painful joint, with the copper cover above it until the heat reaches the root of the joint.
And if it is due to heat, it is to use a copper or iron pipe with some roughness so that the fire does not reach the mouth of the abscess, then wrap the cloth that comes out and place it on the same joint and hold your hand until the cloth cools down. Do this several times.
The patient's pain either subsides that day or on another day, and it is advisable afterwards that the wound be filled with good fat and held in place for an hour, then removed. This is the image of the incision.
The tube is made according to the side that can be, and this is the image of the tube.
The 28th chapter.
In the case of the hernias.
If the hernias were caused by bloating and cold moisture, and not resistant to the growth of the wound with medications, and you want a quick growth, then close the incision that is empty-bellied, this is the image of it, with both sides protruding.
Let the smoke come out of the other side and place it protected on the same tumor twice, until it reaches the depth of the tumor, if the tumor is small, make the incision according to the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and wrap it with a damp cloth in the fat until what burned in the fire is gone, then treat it with mercury and sugar until it is clean, if God willing.
The 29th chapter.
In the case of a narrow throat and tight breathing.
When humors prevail over the bronchus and especially when it is accompanied by depression, it is advisable that the patient first be treated with easy drugs, then the dressing should be applied in the navel of the hernia at the lowest point.
Be careful not to let the dressing reach the hernia and do not burn the skin except for half of it, then apply another dressing at the end of the neck bone in the last part of it, which has been cleaned and the dressing is wrinkled on the surface that has been presented.
Then treat him as has been mentioned until he is relieved if God willing.
The Fourth Chapter and the Thirtieth.
In which disease the lung and vomiting occur.
If the vomiting and lung disease were due to cold humors, and there was no fever or sweat, and the disease was chronic, then the dressing should be applied over the tracts in the lower pale areas of the empty uterus and another dressing in the middle of the chest between the ovaries.
And the dressing should be wrinkled on the surface that has been presented, and if you want, remove it by the dressing called the point and its image has been presented in the removal of the pain in the ears and the points are from three to four points towards it.
Then treat it as previously mentioned until it is cleared, and a three-piece socket has been made on this image, which hastens the process because you will cut it once in three cuts, and this is a picture of the socket.
The fifth chapter and twentieth section.
In the proper position of the thumb.
If the head of the bone is dislodged due to moist exudate or does not settle within a short period, it should be held in place until it becomes firm, then it will dislodge at the slightest movement as we have observed. It is advisable that the fracture be reduced first. Then the patient should lie on his back or on the correct side, and then lift the skin inside the bone upwards using your left thumb if the septum has been dislodged into the interior.
Then protect the socket with the three sockets as shown in the picture.
Then the skin is cut until it reaches the opposite side, and the shape of the socket will be four cuts, and if it is made with a three-pronged socket, the shape will be four cuts at that time, with the prongs on the edge of the material.
This is a picture of the three-pronged socket.
The number of this tool may increase to two, then it carries the sharp points with salt, then the surgeon gives the signal and does not move the part until it becomes strong, and if the cut is from above and is well written.
The upper part of the saw is a good wedge or several wedges that tighten the joint and remove moisture and the surgeon can remove the splint.
The 17th chapter.
In the stomach.
If there is wind and much moisture in the stomach, it should be removed from its place and many sweats are produced, and the patient is treated with various remedies, but if the splint does not improve, it is best for the surgeon to lie on his back with his legs and hands extended and then three tools are used. A saw with a wedge under the chest bone, with two wedges on each side of the first one until it resembles a triangle and is far apart so they do not come together if the saw is sharpened, and the depth of the saw is half the thickness of the skin and the shape of the saw.
And on this figure and this measure without more.
And if you wish a large pouch in the middle of the abdomen on this figure.
And the pouch that encloses this single pouch should be in the shape of a circle on this figure.
And the abdomen should be sutured at the points you want to sew on this pouch with a thread, then the pouch should be sutured with a circular stitch, and the wound should be treated with the treatment you provide until it heals.
The seventh and twentieth section.
In the cold abdomen.
If the abdomen is exposed to cold and dryness or wind, causing it to become too loose and expel its contents, and if you treat it as we mentioned in the classification, it will not heal. It is best that the pouch lies on its side and learns three stitches on this form, with this amount on the abdomen below the scapula, where the human limb attaches.
And each stitch should be made on the edge of the finger, and the pouch should be straight along the length of the body, and do not bend your hand with the thread.
Only half of the skin should be burned, and the wound should be placed on its sides, otherwise it will be distorted and raise the legs. This is the image of the mutilation.
These cuts can be covered with the smooth bandage if you have a seamstress and preserve it so that you don't get infected, as it will burn the skin completely, burning the belly and reaching the organs, as the skin is delicate, so know it.
The eighth and twentieth chapter.
In the abdomen, cut the liver with a knife.
If you find a tumor in the liver, know that it is a heavy and painful burden, as it is found in the meat of the liver.
And if it is in the gallbladder, there is a severe pain, and you saw that it has affected the doctors' treatment, it is better to place the tumor on its side, then learn the warm position with the bandage.
Then, heat the bandage in the fire, this is the bandage that resembles the milk, and this is its image. It should be dressed with one method until the entire skin is burned and ends with cauterization until all time is passed, then it should be treated with the treatment of wounds until it is clean.
This type of cauterization should not be used except in the craft of medicine, as these diseases have been experienced by him many times, and he presents this work and leaves it with me as the best.
The ninth and twentieth section.
In the application of the shave.
The first method of the cold shave was mentioned in the origins of the razor, and it is that it takes from the long, yellow, rough handle one that is longer than what you find and has a shape like the big toe, then it is immersed in oil and burned. Then, a single method is used between the connection of the strap to the neck and two small ones with little abrasion, slightly inclined towards the side under the loincloth, and two large ones above the kidneys in between the third and fourth holes.
And two more in between the fifth and sixth holes, slightly inclined towards the back a little, and two more in the chest and two above the stomach, with three from one side of a single hole between the shoulders and two on the sides of the strap below the one that is between the shoulder blades.
Do not insert your hand too deeply, but it should be visible on the skin surface. Some early ones mentioned using a metal plate similar to steel to protect and then enter it between the digits until it reaches the same tumor.
The duration is as we mentioned in the liver tumor, and in this case of the gallbladder, either the patient may die within an hour or the gallstone may be exposed in its place without any cure.
Chapter Thirty.
In what position the incision.
If you treated the disease of the gallbladder with the treatment mentioned in the division, it did not cure you because the cure is in three or four incisions on both sides of the gallbladder.
In the form of the gallbladder shape and between each incision, there should be a width equal to or more than the size of the finger, and the thickness of the plate we mentioned in the liver is either not inserted with your hand or the tumor is lying on its back.
The other side in the appendix and raises the skin that is next to the gallbladder where the left liver attachment ends and raises the skin that is next to the gallbladder where the left liver attachment ends and your hand raised on the body's outline so the incisions are on the body's length.
Then the suction tubes are inserted very deeply until the skin is peeled off from the other side, then the wound is closed with four stitches, or if you prefer, with the other three suction tubes having three stitches.
Then, treat the wound position after leaving it to hang for many days, as it is the best treatment besides what has been provided.
The ninth and last section.
In the suction process.
The suction is only beneficial in dry wounds, especially, if the patient is treated with the therapeutic doses we mentioned in the division, then the treatment was not effective, you should close four stitches around the anus and one stitch on the stomach.
And another stitch on the liver, one stitch on the penis, and two behind his chest between the ribs, and one stitch behind his abdomen. Then leave the wound open for a long time until it hangs.
Do not neglect the treatment after the wound, as it speeds up the healing process and the appearance of the stitches on the back should be smooth as the one shown and the one on the back should be oily.
The 10th century Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis, titled "The Twenty-Second and Thirty-Second Part," discusses various surgical procedures and their applications. The excerpt provided does not contain any additional information beyond the title of the section.
The excerpt "فى كىّ القدمين والساقين" translates to "In the feet and legs" in English. This suggests that the following content will focus on surgical procedures related to the feet and legs.
The excerpt "اذا تورمتا فى المستسقى وامتلأتا ماء أصفر فينبغى أن يكوى على ظهر القدم فى النقرة التى بين الخنصر والبنصر" translates to "If the feet swell with water and fill the space between the knuckles and the ball of the thumb, it is recommended that the water be drained onto the sole of the foot in the web between the thumb and the little finger." This statement provides a surgical procedure recommendation for treating foot swelling caused by water accumulation.
The excerpt "وأقم يدك بالمكواة ولا تعوّجها ثمّ ارفع يدك ولا تعيدها البتّة فإنّه يرشح الماء الأصفر وتكون المكواة على هذه الصورة" translates to "Then place your hand in the bowl and do not wet it, then raise your hand without touching the bowl again, as this will drain the red water and the bowl should be in this position." This statement provides a surgical procedure recommendation for draining red water from the bowl using the hand.
The excerpt "ثمّ تكوى على الساقين كيّتين كيّتين فى كلّ ساق ويكون الكىّ بالطرف السكّينّى من المكواة ويكون الكىّ على طول الساق واحدة تحت الركبة وأخرى أسفل منها نحو وسط الساق وعلى كلّ فخذ كيّتين كيّتين" translates to "Then place the bowl on both legs, with one side of the bowl facing the narrow side of the bowl and the other side facing the bowl's long edge below the knee, extending from the knee to the middle of the leg on both sides of the foot." This statement provides a surgical procedure recommendation for placing the bowl on both legs in a specific position.
Leave the wound open for a long time, allowing water to reach it, and then treat it with what we have mentioned.
The Thirtieth Chapter.
In the case of vomiting.
If the vomiting is caused by cold and dampness, weakening the muscles and causing diarrhea in the stomach and intestines, and the patient does not improve after treatment, it may be due to the wound being large on his abdomen. In that case, apply large bandages to his abdomen. Regarding the abdomen, apply a bandage of the curved glass with fine glass beads, and large or two kites on top of the coarse cloth.
If I see excessive moisture and the patient's condition is worsening, apply large bandages on his abdomen and around all wounds, and possibly add two small kites near the large ones. This treatment is successful and does not cause harm if God wills.
The Fortieth Chapter.
In the case of being seated on a chair.
If the patient is seated on a chair surrounded by many or one large and cold, harsh, and damp cloth that was treated as we mentioned in the division, the treatment did not help. Apply three kites on the lower part of the back bone under the table leg slightly like a triangle.
A method for abdominal surgery, similar to two fingers, if it is estimated that the stomach has turned and food does not rise to his face, which is distorted, then open the abdomen using a large abdominal incision and also make an incision in his liver. And another on the side with a square piece of parchment and leave the incision open for a while, then treat it until he is cured, if God wills.
The 5th and 33rd chapter.
In the second part of the Ka'aba.
After cutting the throat, if the throat was cut, open the incision that resembles the tail and then insert it into the same cut throat and clean your hands until the wound touches the fang of the animal that produces blood, which does this once or twice.
If the throat is many, open each one as we described, then treat it according to what it requires from the dressing until it is cured, and if the wound is large on the cloth, it was said in the benefit.
The 6th and 34th chapter.
In the part of the neck that is in the seat and its surroundings.
When there is a fracture in the arm and fluids become putrid, the first thing you should do is to measure it with a fine measuring rod.
Then, know the extent of the fracture with the measuring rod, then cover the wound that resembles the elbow, and insert it into the same arm while maintaining the elbow's position and the measurement taken by the ruler until all the putrid bodies burn completely once or twice or three times according to your need.
And preserve the burning of the nerve if there is one or a large amount of blood, and if the arm is dislocated towards the elbow or the elbow.
And preserve these areas, and only do this if the arm is in a fatty position and you have determined that it is not dislocated, then treat the area until it is clear, and if it closes and cuts off the materials and remains like this for a while, know that it has healed completely.
And if it does not close and cut off the materials, know that it is dislocated or in the elbow of a rotten bone or something similar as mentioned in its position.
The 7th and 32nd chapter.
In the kidney.
If there is pain in the kidney, with cold or strong wind and decreased urine production, it is recommended to apply a poultice of comfrey on the affected kidney, on both sides, using the same comfrey paste on each kidney. Perhaps a third poultice can be applied in the same meal, which will bring about the most benefit.
The 8th and 33rd chapter.
In the case of diarrhea.
If there is diarrhea, weakness, and dryness until the urine does not stick to the comfrey paste, apply a poultice of comfrey on the back of the uterus, where the diarrhea starts, on both sides, from the right side to the left.
And after the poultice, on both sides, according to the size of the ejaculation and the application of the paste, apply a poultice on the back of the abdomen or both sides if it is desired, and the paste should be mucilaginous as before.
The 9th and 34th chapter.
In the case of gout.
If there is gout, a cold and dry matter, it prevents the urine from flowing and causes inflammation of the bladder, making it difficult to pass urine. If this happens when the patient approaches, it is recommended to apply three poultices around the uterus, as we mentioned in the case of diarrhea. Technique for the chest: it may be one or two and the incision is curved.
Chapter Four.
How to remove the weave.
Moisture may be inserted under the weave, causing it to deviate from its position and indicating that the leg is protruding on one side or another when some parts of it are removed. If this is the case, it is recommended to cut the wound in the same place as the weave, almost a circle.
After learning about the weave around the chest, it will rotate so that the same chest is in the center of the circle and the incision that appears in the stomach should be made with three curved incisions using the large olive oil incision.
Show the depth of the cut on the skin all around and then treat it until it is cleared, if God wills.
Chapter Seven and Fourth.
In the case of menstruation.
If there is pain in the chest, and the cause was cold and moisture, and the wound was treated as mentioned in the division, but the pain did not subside and it persisted, it is recommended to ease the wound from the tight clothes or bandages by using silk or flax.
Then, the face of the patient is treated with either the burning drugs or fire, and in some cases, it is treated with fire alone, as shown in this image.
And it will have a proper depth, and there will be one between each cavity and the next, with the incision being oily and it may be in the middle on the head of the wound itself, making it four cavities, and if you wish, you can make the incision in the circle that is mentioned for removing the wound one at a time.
The circle should surround all the wound and burn the entire skin, this is the shape of the cavity in the woman's blood if the pain was necessary for the wound and it did not extend to the ankle and knee.
If it extends to the ankle and knee, make the incision on the ankle at the position indicated by your pain in the wound, and a cavity above the knuckles with four fingers on the monstrous side, and the incision should be shallow and the depth of the cavity should only be on the skin that is burned.
And if the pain extends to the level of the male's fingers, make the incision where you were indicated by the cavity point of three or four or more, and if the pain is below the knee towards the ankle, make the incision here with a shallow cavity.
Preserve all bones and avoid burning large veins or tendons, as this may cause serious injury or delayed healing.
I have seen and heard of two men who fell on their shoulders and suffered severe injuries that reached their feet, causing them to become lame and eventually die. This pain was equally severe in both cases.
Some scholars among the rulers have mentioned that this type of fall is like making a piece of iron resembling a nail with a length of half a grain of wheat and placing it at the throat, either on the root of the palm or slightly less. Inside this nail, there is another nail and a third one.
After each nail, there is a space of an inch and the nails are open on both sides and their height is towards the knot or knots and they take a clamp made of iron that is sharper than the nails and this is the appearance of it.
Then it is wrapped in fire until it turns red and burns the hair, then it is placed on the correct side of the fall and the injury is covered with three cushions in one time and left for three days and the wound is covered with fat and left open for three days.
Many times, it is treated with incision until it is cleared, as stated by the author of this book, this type of patient who used this tool for identification and observation and shortness of breath in those who can bear it, except that it is good for those who can bear it and are affected in the affected area.
As for the drugs that cause cauterization, it is that you make two wires similar to a rope, in which a silver or iron nail penetrates.
The height of the notches in them is two or similar, and there is a gap between them, the tip of the finger is in it, and it is open at the bottom and closed at the top, and some of them are stuck on each other like this.
Then, it is placed on the correct and incorrect side of the wound, covered with your hand, and you pour between the two wires with hot water that is cleaned with narghile, and holds it for a while, and the patient endures the heat and burning, as he finds it like fire.
Until the pain subsides, then raise your hand with the tool and clean the hot water from the wound with soft water, and leave it for three days and carry weight on it until the white of the burn is gone and leave it for days that are done from it, as it informs in the benefit.
Then it is treated with a poultice until it is relieved, for if the pain extends to the heel or leg, it has made a bed for the water according to what was made by the gall, whether, and this is the nature of the hot water, which has been proven in an article on the repair of drugs.
She takes from the salt of the gall and from unsalted gall bladder, divides them into parts, and roasts them, then places them in a new vessel that has been pierced with a small hole at the bottom, and places another empty vessel under it that has been mixed.
And she pours the hot water on the gall and gall bladder, covers them with her thumb, leaves the vessel until the hot water comes down to the bottom of the mixed vessels, then collects all the water together, and pours it on another gall bladder and another small gall bladder.
For it is then very strong and acts in many operations of medicine and in other organs because it does the action of fire on itself, and among the drugs that contain the gall is also what contains the turmeric, such as the theriac, and gum arabic and gall bladder with soap exhausted.
A certain Jalenos claimed that a man from the ancient times was cured of the pain of walking and the excess of women, and his case was very severe. He claimed that he did not need any other treatment and that he was freed from one occasion.
Even until he entered the bath and came out cured, and if he did not find green onion, he took white onion instead, and his pain was eased with something from smoke and he placed it on the knee where the pain was or in the leg or in the elbow.
And he should remain patient and leave for three hours or as long as the patient feels the pain is steady, then enter the bath. If his body responds, he enters the tub, and the pain goes away and is cured by the permission of God, and if it does not go away, he should put on the bandage again after ten days another time.
He is cured if God wills, and know that it is not appropriate to use any of these drugs except after the body is purified, and Dioscorides mentioned that the oil of mastich when applied with the urine of a woman who has excess of women's humor is beneficial.
The drug should be in this form, it is taken with sulfur in the old oil and placed on the deep place between the ejaculation of the hand and the orgasm, which is closest to the orgasm, and then take a dry mastich ointment.
Heat it until it turns black, then place it on sand and leave it until it burns. Take the rest of it and continue doing this until the pain passes through the bone to the joint and the suffering is relieved by God's will. This is the treatment known as the poor man's charcoal.
The Second Chapter and Fortieth.
In the pain of the back.
The pain in the back may be due to various causes such as a fall, a blow, or an excessive discharge, and it is of the cold and moist category. The charcoal only falls into this category.
After the swelling subsides, it is recommended to apply charcoal on the back where the pain is located, which is three fingers wide on both sides of the plate, after learning the position of the linen in each finger five times or more, according to the possibility of the swelling and its strength.
The charcoal is applied with a piece of cloth and if you want to remove it, three or four times with a medium-sized sponge on this image.
The Third Chapter and Elbow.
In the beginning of the incision.
This incision is often performed on children and an early sign of it in a child is shortness of breath during movement and later, hair loss on the scalp that has turned white and stands out from the rest of the hair.
If you see that and want to stop it, use a circle of dough on this picture. To take the dress around all the baldness, if you want to, wrap it around the baldness with a circle of three or four points and make the points close to each other, then treat the area until it is clean as we mentioned.
And remember to use the dress in the incision that is made by cutting the nerve.
The fourth and fourteenth section.
In the shoulder and the joints of the limbs.
If the joint of the limb becomes cold and is stuck to any part of the body, it is common for doctors to call this a special shoulder.
If the cold shoulder is cured by the treatment we mentioned in the division and the swelling has not disappeared, then the dress goes over it because it is wrapped around the joint of the leg many times and the dough is medium oily on this picture.
If you intend to suture on the man's face, then use the tip of the needle, as it often leads to the knees or other joints, and frequently exposes the knee joint on both sides of three or four rucks in this ointment.
If you wish to go further than this, do not pierce your hand with it, but rather make it like a sharp tool that only cuts the skin, as it often leads to the shoulders or back, and we have mentioned the tip of it in the previous section.
If the suture is only in the hands, then make it around the fingers as they turn, and if the suture remains in the fingers, make it on every nail point and on the palm, as it often leads to the tendons or joints after some time.
The suture should be made from both sides and the bad luck should not hinder good treatment, and take the medicine, for if the best food and fasting remove it, then this ointment will do so with God's will.
Chapter Five and Forty.
In the fifth section.
If a fever is presented in the Arabs and some excrements and dung fall into the privy, it is often the beginning of the disease soon. It is advisable to order the patient to fast that day and to use from the mucus what comes out of his anus.
He then lies on his back with his chest exposed and commands him to hold himself still until the fracture or dislocation becomes visible, then you tap it with your finger, then learn the method of traction under the flap on the affected bone a mark resembling half a circle on the sides of the limb up to the top of the body.
Then this area is covered.
Until it turns white, the pin is inserted, then the dislocation or fracture is reduced to its place, and a pad is placed between the ankle bones and under them, another servant places a saddle on his feet.
And another on his back holds his hands, then the dressing is placed on the mark itself and he holds it with the dressing standing straight and holds it until it reaches the bone or is redone again if it does not reach the bone.
And preserve your effort to avoid the swelling of the dislocation while you are doing it, lest it burn the ankle either by death or great pain. And know that when you do not reach the bone with your effort, it means that your work has failed. It is best for the dressing of children to be gentle on their limbs and for adults on their limbs.
After three days, treat the wound with sandalwood paste until the fire subsides, then treat it with other ointments until it heals. Allow the wound to be uncovered for forty days until the incision scars over.
It is recommended that the patient's diet be limited to the duration of treatment, so as not to cause diarrhea during fasting and abstinence. If one wishes to continue after forty days, use a firm bandage and wear it for another forty days, which will reduce fatigue and avoid excessive food and drink, and severe coughing.
If this treatment is carried out in this way, it will be completely effective, and I will mention the treatment of the scar in another chapter, if God willing, and as for the scar that occurs on the entire abdomen and was initial, if you want it not to increase more than it should, it can be divided into sections according to its size. Let not more than a third of the skin burn, and then treat it as we have mentioned, if God willing, and some early authors suggested that the scar be divided into a triangular piece like this.
After learning about the scar with thread and the line that is vertical on the side of the scar and the other one going down, and your hand goes in the middle with a single, smooth nail, the first one is easier and better, if God wills.
The 10th Century Arabic Textbook on Surgery by Albucasis, Chapter 64.
In which part of the chapter.
If there is a wound or bruise in some parts of the body and the pain persists for a long time and does not improve with medication, it is recommended to apply a poultice of the point and make each part according to its size, strength, and weakness.
And the pain and swelling from it indicates that the first part is cured, otherwise it should be applied again because often these pains spread from one part to nearby parts, so it is recommended to follow up with the poultice until the affected person is cured.
Chapter 65 of the 10th Century Arabic Textbook on Surgery by Albucasis.
In which case of bone fracture.
As for the fractured bones, they benefit greatly from the poultice and especially the type of fracture that occurs due to torn ligaments and tendons.
If you want to know how to treat it, if the fracture is fresh and treated as described in the division and has not healed and the patient fears that the disease will seize all of its moods, then apply a poultice on the head with five parts. In the middle of the usual head, one on top and two below it towards the edge of the hair and two on the sides and one from behind on the shoulder point and massage your hand gently until it affects the bone gradually.
And remove the hairs to make it easier to breathe out the steamy vapors from them and wrap them neatly on the same handle as before, and if the boil has continued on the swelling and shown visible signs of it, it is recommended that these wraps be used that we mentioned in the head. Wraps on the nose, two on the cheeks, two on the ears and one large wrap on the teeth when the tooth is missing and another above it in the same plate and two on the shoulders on each shoulder. Two on the thighs, one on each thigh, two on the bends, two on the back of the ribs and wraps on all the bones of the fingers of his hands and feet and on all the ankles of his feet and toes of his hands.
And preserve the nerve that is at the end of the ankles so they do not burn, and a wrap may be on the bone of the injury and another on the stomach's mouth and another on the liver, and know that as you get better and better the more beneficial and effective it is.
Know that the allopathic physician does not find pain as severe as the correct one, because his body has become accustomed to it. It is recommended that the anesthetic be according to the size of the limbs and joints, based on the properties of the elements.
Then treat the patient with a fine cloth soaked in honey and other remedies, if God wills.
The eighth and forty-eighth chapter.
In the treatment of pain, when a limb becomes painful due to a bone or joint, it is treated with drugs, ointments, and poultices. If the pain does not subside, the same painful bone or joint should be treated according to its size. The application should be light and not cause inflammation of the skin.
Then treat it with mustard until it is relieved, and some pain in the limbs or foot may be caused by the nerve exit where the nerve that moves that part of the body exits.
This is all that is recommended, except for those who have experience in dissecting the limbs and nerve exits that control the body.
The ninth and forty-ninth chapter.
In the treatment of bruises.
When the knife does not penetrate the skin of the flesh, then a slight cut is made on its edge until the white becomes clear and changes color.
Then it is treated with ointment of rose oil and the blood of the calf or the blood of the ham and the blood of the khatm is mixed together and applied to the wound until it is clean.
The fifth book.
How cancer be treated.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop it, then cut around it as the circle turns, as some rulers have mentioned that it should be cut deeply in the middle but I do not see this because I do not expect it to grow and have seen it grow many times.
The correct thing is that it should be cut around it as we have said or with many small cuts.
The sixth and fifth book.
How to treat leprosy.
If one of the leprosy patients has slowed down in its progress, either because of the power of the disease or because of the age of the patient and if you want to speed up its progress, then cut around it with many small cuts to dry it.
Then leave it, for it speeds up the process. If you want to cut it, then smooth this side as it appears.
And place it in the center of the garden until the skin is peeled and the knife is as follows, which makes the cutting easier. Then treat it according to what is appropriate until it is clean.
The second chapter, twenty-fifth.
In the eating.
Eating is only a corruption that seeks in the body what the fire consumes, as the ashes of the old iron. If you see eating in a place where it can be burned, then smooth many small and large notches on the edges according to what suits that place.
Then smooth it from all sides until the corruption is completely eliminated and nothing remains of the cut, then leave it for three days and apply lead plaster with oil to all the sore spots until the pus is completely drained and all the corruption.
Then treat it with honey for meat, for after three days I saw that the meat grew a correct plant without corruption in it, or if not, then cut the knife on what remains of the corrupt areas, and the eating can be treated with strong medicine.
Heating the wound is the quickest remedy and it has been mentioned in the division to take medicine from there when it has become inflamed.
The third chapter, fifth section.
In the position of false and unfalse incisions.
This wound is often found in the soles of the feet, it is something rough that pains the man, either by heat or cold water.
And if the wound is by heat, it is to cover the inverted cone similar to the snake's horn with a thin metal sheet and then place it on the cone and turn your hand around the cone until the hand reaches the depth of the cone.
And leave it for three days to heal, then wrap it with coarse salt and leave the wrap on it overnight as it will peel off from its roots and then treat the wound position with garlic that has sprouted for meat until it is clean, if the wounds are not false.
And it is often found on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, it is better to take a tube from copper or iron or snake's horn and place it on the wound or the nail and then pour cold water into the tube in small amounts.
Keep your hand held tight and use a little force with your other hand to affect the tube's hinge and find the way to dive into the root of the plant. The patient endures little pain for an hour with the hot water.
Then leave it, as the plant detaches itself by its roots, in this way you do with one until all of it comes out of the body, then you treat the affected areas after what comes out from the wound.
The Fourth and Fiftieth Chapter.
In the Navel.
If one of the navels has a cold or inflammation in the nerve or elsewhere, it is recommended to apply four or five dressings on the back of the ribs between each dressing and in the chest. And on the abdomen, apply ointment made of olive oil, as the navel warms and speeds up the healing of the cold disease.
The Fifth and Fiftieth Chapter.
In the Case of a Severe Bleeding in the Body.
It may be that the wound is caused by cold and corrupt materials in the body, and it is recommended to apply a dressing on the head of each wound as soon as it appears, to make it soft and gentle with a piece of cloth dipped in hot water or with a long zarud or with an ointment made of oil.
The text has been translated into English as follows: "The damsel has assumed its first form on this species, it does not increase and spreads the active advantage of it and liberates the afflicted only if he is to be disclosed by the fingers.
The title of the 10th chapter in Arabic has been translated into English as: "Chapter Sixteen and Fifteenth.
The text has been translated into English as follows: "In what kind of bleeding is the severe one after cutting the thread.
The text has been translated into English as follows: "Often, the bleeding of blood from the thread is caused by a cut that exposes it outside or by a wound and fragment or part of an organ, and so on, making it difficult to cut.
The text has been translated into English as follows: "If such an event occurs, quickly use your hand to press the thread's mouth with your thumb and squeeze it as much as possible so that the blood is completely contained under your thumb and nothing comes out of it. Then, place small and large almond-shaped candles in the fire and blow on them until they become a thick insulation.
The text has been translated into English as follows: "Then, take one, either small or large, from it according to the wound and the position where the thread was cut, and place the wick on the same color after your thumb has removed it and hold the wick until the blood stops.
When you pull the pulley to lift your stitch from the thread and cut it, take another piece from the same roll of thread that is in the heated state and continue to do this until the blood stops flowing.
Do not burn the nerve that is there, as it will speak on the other side of the thread graft. Know that when blood comes out of the thread, it cannot be cut, especially if the thread is large, except by one of four ways, either by the edge as we said or by burning it if it has not been burned. If the nerve is burned, its sides shrink and blood comes out, either to tie it with threads in a tight manner or to put on it drugs that cut the blood vessels and make them hard with the reeds hardened.
And if someone tries to cut it with a grip, or with hardening, or with the things that have been burned, and so on, it will not be cut by that only in desperation, as one of these is placed without the doctor's attention and without the drug, let him put his little finger on the wound itself as we described.
And it is pressed so much that the blood stops flowing and comes out of the wound and on the thread and the finger, it does not leave from it with cold water, which permanently freezes the blood and makes it hard, and cuts, and during this you look for what it needs from a or drug.
The second chapter.
In the surgical operations and procedures.
Khlefa mentioned in the first chapter that all diseases that can be cured by fire and burning drugs, their causes, reasons, instruments, and images of the marginal gods, have been included in this book from the past to the present.
And I follow this path in this chapter for the student's convenience.
Before I start, it is necessary for you, O children, to learn that this chapter contains the most important points about the surgical operations and procedures.
And therefore, it is necessary for the warning in this chapter to be more severe because the operation in this chapter often leads to confusion of the blood that is present when opening the artery, incising a vein, or cutting on the pulsating artery, or performing surgery, or removing a grape, or incising on a piece of flesh, and all of which lead to the most serious mistakes, fear, and death.
And I advise you to be careful in what is written in this book because it may happen to you in this profession that some people are divided into categories with rods, and among them are those who have been affected by their disease and died as a result of it.
The strength of the patient's condition and the length of his illness, as well as the diagnosis from the disease that indicates death, are all indications of the desire for health and the struggle of the sick. It is not appropriate for you to assist those who are in this severe condition.
May your caution be greater than your desire and your care, and do not offer anything except after knowing what is certainly safe for you in the outcome of the affliction, and use all the knowledge and warning in all the treatments that come to safety.
For in this you have a help in acquiring praise, honor, glory, and thanks, may Allah guide you, O children of His guidance, and do not exclude what is good and beneficial. For this is in His hand, and there is no deity but He.
This chapter has been arranged in sections according to what comes before in the chapter of what is from the past to the present, so that you may not desire what you seek from it, insha'Allah.
The first section.
In the treatment of water that accumulates in the heads of children.
This encephalon is often exposed to children at birth due to the pressure of the head of the child without proper support, and it may also be exposed due to an unknown hidden cause.
I have never seen this operation performed on anyone but children, and all of them who I saw undergo it died, so I saw the work stopped with them. I have also seen a boy whose head was filled with water and the head was more important every day. Until the child does not sit on his own due to the heaviness of his head and the water increases until he dies.
And this moisture either meets between the skin and the bone, or it meets under the bone on the phlanges, and the work in this case is if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the tumor is small, then it is best to make a single incision in the middle of the head with a narrow width and its length is about ten fingers until the moisture drains, and this is the appearance of the carpenter.
And if the moisture is more and the tumor is larger, then make it a double incision as in this picture:
And if the moisture is under the bone and the sign is that you see the cracks of the head open from all sides and the water drains when you press it with your hand inside, then it is best to make three incisions in the middle of the head as in this picture:
After the application, all moisture is expelled, then the corners and edges are sharpened by cutting and filing, then it turns into watery fluid on the fifth day, then the gouge is filled and the wound is treated with plaster and splints, and does not leave the head swollen and feeds the baldness with all dry foods, little moisture.
To strengthen the member and remove it, another recipe for the gouge is where you look to see the bone of the tumor and the water to gather because it may be in the back of the head more or in the front, or on the right side or the left side.
The gouge intends to where the tumor appears and fills the water and sharpens it on what you can and preserves that you cut a thread and there is bleeding from the baldness of death from this bleeding with the discharge of moisture.
The second chapter.
Cut the two strings that are behind the known horns.
When one of the wounds is exposed to the eyes or the chest and it does not heal with the medicine, inform the treatment and cut these two strings.
If you want to cut them, it is best to cut the baldness with turmeric and then mark the position with a sharp cut to show the string, then tighten the neck of the baldness with the help of the cloth, then look where the blood flows and the two positions that are behind the horns and say what is hidden except in some people.
He then teaches them to sew on it with the thread, then cuts them with the blade until they reach the bone, and this is done with the head exposed, and if you wish, insert the blade from under the suture and cut through to the top with the cuts, and the length of the cuts should be approximately two fingers' breadth.
If the flesh is cut, blood will come out in a pulsating manner and form a continuous covering, if the suture is not visible, it is recommended to use the ear after three fingers, then teach with the thread and sew to the bone, which should be done.
Send six or more drops of blood on the wound, and possibly send more or less depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their veins, then look at the wound if something remains on the bone from the puncture, and cut it off.
So that the hot worm does not appear, then open the wound with a sharp knife and treat it with mercury until it is clean.
The third section.
Tie the two threads in the knots.
If a man has a brother with chronic or severe headaches, frequent nosebleeds, and hot flashes in the muscles or temples, or similar conditions, and it has not been treated with medication, we have tried tying the threads from the knots or as described.
The objective of this operation is to shave the hair present in the ears and reveal the visible thread in the heart, as it can be understood from its pulsation and a little of what is hidden in each person.
If the cold is severe, then let the thread be revealed by stretching its neck with the help of the clothing, and then you will know the position by pinching or wetting the position with warm water until the thread appears clearly and visibly. Then take the scraper with this appearance. Then scrape the skin along it until it reaches the thread, then insert a needle into it and draw it out from all sides because if the thread is thin, twist it with the tip of the needle. Then cut a piece from it according to the distance between its sides and do not cause bleeding because if it has not been cut and not cut, the blood has not risen at all. Then remove the blood from six or seven veins to three.
If the thread is large, it is better to tie it in two places with a fine thread, and the thread should be either from absinth or from oaths so that the edge does not rustle before the wound is sutured, causing bleeding.
When the incision is made between the tendons, it can be done at that time or later in the day. If you wish to cover it with a thin layer of bone to make it appear as if it is part of the limb, do so with this method or the best way we have described.
However, if the patient is feverish or has a bad mood because of the dryness in the wound, it will be more beneficial to leave it open. After tying the threads, the area should be shaved with a sharp blade and the bandages should be applied, followed by the application of cheap medicines that promote the growth of meat and the use of the splint until it is possible to remove it, if God wills.
If bleeding occurs during your work, cut the thread either way and fill the area with a cloth and tighten your hand until the blood stops. If nothing helps, use your thumb to stop the bleeding.
Wet the area with very cold water until the wound is healed and then apply it as needed, which is easier and simpler than cutting the thread by using this type of bandage with sutures after learning how to tie the knots.
A thick glove is worn until it reaches the bone and cuts off the blood supply at two points to prevent the edges from touching this soft tissue, as shown in the image below.
The edges of the sickle should resemble the small incisors but be less sharp than the main incisor because if they were as sharp, the meat would freeze faster and not cut quickly. If there is some thickness between them, the fire will be free to pass through.
The meat is cut quickly, and this method is the best and simplest of all, and after the sickles are between the teeth, the finger should be wide enough to fit comfortably.
The fourth section.
In treating the constant burning of hot tears to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and come from the external eyebrow of the head without improving with any remedy, observe that the face of the patient has become red. And he feels in his throat a large mouse-like lump and his eyes are swollen and watery, as if they have been eaten by something and their corners have become red from the tears. At first, the physicians resorted to this treatment and called it shaving the hair that is in his throat.
In the margin, three incisions of equal length are made along the edge, with the length of each incision approximately two fingers' breadth, parallel to the nasal bone in the middle of the edge. The second is slightly beyond the movement of the muscle in the chest, and the third is from the opposite side.
Then preserve the two sutures on both sides and keep your hand away from the knot of the suture, with each incision having three fingers' breadth between them. Make sure you have prepared a pair of pre-cut or deeply cut scissors to control the bleeding as much as possible.
Then insert the sharp-pointed forceps with the two blades facing each other as shown in the figure. From the blade following the chest, use the forceps to remove all the skin between the incisions with the pliers, then do the same from the middle incision to the third one, and finally remove the forceps. Also, insert another instrument called a sharp scalpel from the first blade and a blunt one from the other side. This is how it looks:
The sharp side should be pointing up towards the meat-covered skin and the blunt side down towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle incision and cut all the veins that flow from the head to the eyes without letting the cuts reach the skin surface.
In the middle section, perform the operation from one end to the other, after removing a moderate amount of blood from the sharp cuts, then place fine pieces of cloth soaked in wine and oil or ghee on each section.
To prevent burning, remove the bandage on the third day and use a large amount of water on the fourth day, then treat it with the basil linen and other things used in surgeries until it is cleaned, may God help.
The fifth section.
In the treatment of tears and discharge from the eyes inside the head.
When one of the discharges was severe and sudden, with both eyes appearing to be small and broken, and their vision had weakened and their eyelids were swollen, and the tears were falling from them. And it would be a severe and painful headache with persistent tears, knowing that these symptoms are from many deep veins and the best treatment in this case is this treatment, which is to order the victim to tie the corner of the sheet, then cut a section in the middle of the corner.
And it would be a severe and painful headache with persistent tears, knowing that these symptoms are from many deep veins and the best treatment in this case is this treatment, which is to order the victim to tie the corner of the sheet, then cut a section in the middle of the corner. Or raise a little on the side and start from the shoulder to the other shoulder, and the section should be to the bone and your hand should be away from the moving muscles of the shoulder when the bone is broken until if the bone breaks and all the blood is dissolved in esfning.
Distinguish between the wound of the chest with a piece of linen or a handful of flax, then cover it with thyme and let it drink thyme wine and olive oil to prevent a hot tumor from forming, and when the tumor has been removed, observe that the tumor has indeed been destroyed before you start to heal the bone.
Then treat it with the drying ointment that produces beef, like taking four parts of dried ghee and one part of candied onions, and they are prepared together and used in the growth of beef in such surgeries.
The sixth chapter.
In treating what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is either of four kinds, either a metallic substance or something resembling a stone like copper and glass, or a plant-like substance such as henbane and nutmeg, and also something like water and blood, and so on.
And if it is a piece of an animal that does not grow in the ear, receive it in the ear with the sun and if you see only oil or sand in it, try to remove it by moving the head or by twisting the turban. The excerpt translates to: "The tube for the ears is placed around the ear after a hole or a cavity is made, and the ear is pulled upwards. This treatment is often effective, but if it does not work, try pulling it out gently with the soft point, as shown in this image.
The excerpt translates to: "If it came out gently, try pulling it out with a thin wire, as shown in this image. If it still does not come out, make a tube from flint and insert one end of the tube into the ear hole.
The excerpt translates to: "Tie the tube with waxed thread so that wind does not pass through it, then attract it gently with your breath. Often, it comes out this way, but if it still does not come out, use a feather or a lightly twisted tail feather and place it in the opening of the mouth.
The excerpt translates to: "After washing it with a cloth, insert it into the ear hole gently, followed by drying the ear. If it still does not come out, start treating it before the tumor becomes hot or the scar forms.
The excerpt translates to: "The treatment for the scar is to remove it from the thigh or leg, depending on its strength. Then, place the scar between your hands and turn the ear upwards and make a small incision in the middle of the ear at the site where it was rubbed.
The gallbladder should be cut in a suitable shape until it reaches the square, then remove it as much as possible with the tools, and quickly scrape the gallbladder from your position and treat it until it is cleared.
If something falls into the ear from one of the grains that grows and expands, try to remove it as we mentioned, but if you cannot, take a fine, soft rag on this image.
Try to cut that kind of grain that falls into the ear, but only do this if you know that that grain has absorbed water in the ear until it becomes many small pieces, then remove it with the sharp needle, or with a soft finger, or with a sharp knife.
As we mentioned, it is easier to remove it, and as for the water inside the ear, it is recommended that the cotton swab be used with the kunds or first fill the ear with something from the flax cloth that is damp on that ear, and then it will come out with that.
Or you can take small pieces along the length of your fingers, roll them into a ball, heat them slightly in the fire, and insert one of them into the earhole of the ear and hold it on one side of that direction with your other hand and hit it with another stone on the stone inside the ear.
The patient should continue to remove slices until all the water is expelled, and the water may be removed by taking it from the icy or from one hand and inserting one finger into the ear, while the other side is exposed to fire until it burns more of it, and then the other hand is replaced.
The patient should continue to do this until all the water is expelled or it is drawn out by the catheter as it advances in the slice, and as for removing the internal animal from it, observe that if it is a small carcass like the rabbit and similar to it, it is treated as mentioned in the division, and if not.
If the carcass of the patient is large, try to remove it by pressing with the fingers and nails, and order it to be easier than all that occurs in the ear, and if the internal animal produced in the ear was treated as mentioned in the division for the corks in the article on the corks and no treatment was effective.
It is advisable to look at the ear in the sun because if something appears in it, remove it by pressing with the fingers or nails, and if nothing appears of it, take this catheter as it is depicted.
The lower part is narrow and the upper part wide, and insert the thin finger into the ear as much as possible, then press it with a strong pressure until all the internal animals are expelled, and if you do not want to exit, surround the catheter with the turmeric as mentioned in the slice.
If you do not exit by what we mentioned, use the needles that we mentioned and which have been tried by the first ones in killing the rat and you will find that this is in the article on needles and it is the spindle of the adhans and medicines in the ear with this tool and this is its image.
As you see, it is made from gold or a thin copper below with a small sharp point at the top and if you want, the gun that is in the center of the pipe is made of hard copper and if you want, took a knife and polished its edge with a hard cloth.
Then, you receive the ointment or the ointment or whatever medicine you want in the pipe and it is in the ear, then insert your finger with the cloth from above and gently rub it until the oil flows into the cochlea and you feel.
Inside, and may what you inject into the ear have been heated slightly in the fire, and be careful not to put something cold or hot inside that would cause discomfort.
Chapter 7.
In the treatment of the deviated septum in the ear.
Some children may exit from the throats of their mothers and unbent ears.
This blockage in the ear's course might be due to a wound or a bone growth, and this blockage could be deep within the thickness of the ear, unseen by the eye.
The prominence of the projection might be slight, and visible by the eye, but the part that is not visible by the eye and is deep within the ear is more difficult to see, and should be placed in the sun for better visibility. And if you see it, open it with a gentle forceps to see this image:
The angle of the blockage is slight but limited on one side, and the forceps should be gently applied to avoid harming the ear. If the blockage is due to bone growth in the ear's course, it should be removed with a sharp forceps until all the bone is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, gently heat it with a gentle forceps, then cool it in the sun, and if you feel the blockage with the ear's prominence, remove it with a sharp forceps.
And be careful not to cut the nerve of the ear, then leave a small piece of bone in the ear's thickness that may have been dislodged during the Egyptian surgery. Do this for days until the wound heals or place a small piece of bone in water and apply it with a moistening agent.
If I see the ear has swollen and is red, it is best to remove the caustic and replace it with another one that has been made in rotten grape juice until the red swelling subsides, then treat it to remove it.
If there is a severe bleeding or a crack in the cold water, place it on the ear and use other treatments that cut the mentioned bleeding as described in the chapter of the blisters.
The eighth section.
In the treatment of the boils that appear on the face.
These boils that appear on the eyelid may be moist and black, it is best to cover them with a piece of cloth or a bandage and cut out their roots, then apply a ointment to the spot.
If the bleeding from it is blood from the eye, use a mild ointment to soften and cut off its roots, and most of the time it returns because there is something left of its roots, and if it burns in fire, it burns the roots and there is nothing left.
The ninth section.
In the treatment of the cold in the eyelid of the eye.
Often there is something similar to the cold in the intensity and stiffness of the eyelid.
Thus, it is called 'dryness' and refers to a severe moisture accumulation in the upper and lower abdominal regions, with the operation involving observing if the dryness is prominent on the appearance of the abdomen, causing it to move towards all sides and then making an incision on it.
Then, it is separated from all sides in a straight line until it heals, then it is tied with a thread and cut, and if it does not hurt after the abdomen is cut, there is no harm in this. If the incision is large, it should be closed with stitches and treated until it is clean.
If it is small, there is no harm in it, as the scar will force and soothe it. If the dryness is inclined towards the inner abdomen towards its inner surface, then twist the abdomen and tie the dryness with a thread without needing to cut and remove it from all sides.
If the abdomen is cut, it does not cause any harm. Then, clean the eye with salt water after cutting the dryness and treat the area until the scar is clean.
The 10th section.
In the treatment of the entropion that is presented in the eye abdomen.
The gallstone is a concretion that occurs in the upper layers of the intestinal walls and is most exposed to children, it weighs down their eyes and they are exposed to its effects at night, they cannot bear the light of the sun. To make him cry faster.
So they always look sad on their faces and sleep on them, and the sweat of the gallstone is visible to the eye and when you move your fingers between them, you feel the gallstone between them, and the purpose of the operation is for the patient to place his head on your stone.
Then take a sharp edge from it and make a circle around the gallstone on all sides, then place it on it and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the gallstone in the middle of the circle.
Then cut through the center of that moisture with the scalpel, and the cut should not be larger than the cut in the skin, but in the depth, it is better to cut through the entire skin until it reaches the gallstone.
In most cases, the gallstone is more visible on a white scar than a cut wound, and it attracts your attention with a sharp edge that you can pull out of your fingers with your other hand, and keep your right hand moving until you escape, and be careful not to increase the cut, otherwise the scalpel may touch the eye and hurt it.
If the flaying does not appear in the first section, it is recommended to slightly increase the size of the section until the flaying becomes visible, then draw it out as we have described, and place it on the position and press it with a blunt tool, and among people who use salt.
It is placed in the center of the section to allow the remaining moisture to evaporate, then it is treated until it is clear if there is inflammation or heat in the area and it is treated with a mild ointment until it is cleared.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the measurement of the eyelid.
If there is growth in the orbit of the eye, excessive scarring beyond the natural groove under the natural scars and spreads, it harms the eye and causes symptoms such as constant tears, eye strain, white and red eyes until it becomes a cause for blindness.
The measurement of the eyelid is done on four sides, either by fire or strong medicine as described in chapter one, or it can be cut and trimmed with a knife or scalpel according to what I remember.
It is recommended to place the handle of the forceps in your socket and then bend the orbit of the eye with your left hand, if it bends or else insert a needle into it from below the orbit and withdraw the needle with the thread from above and it should be close to the same hair and draw the thread up through the orbit.
Turn the wound inwards, then incise through the pelt without excessive hair around the wound, from the largest to the smallest toe, then suture and place a small patch of cloth or rag under the skin, then close the wound with silk.
The shape of the bone is like this, but it should be as you want to raise the skin because it may differ from person to person, some people need to cut off the skin according to how much the skin has stretched.
And some people need to cut less according to how much the skin has stretched, then incise through the lines you taught and start from the largest toe to the smallest one, making sure the cut is close to the natural hair of the wound.
Then insert the scalpel into one of the angles of the skin, then cut it all, then gather the two edges with a needle and thin silk thread, clean the blood, and tie the excess threads on the shoulders with some things that are neat.
You should do this, otherwise it will not be possible, then the suture and the thread will remain for about three days or four, then treat it, and if you left the wound without stitching, treat it with something that reduces swelling and closes the skin because the skin rises when the wound is closed and stitched.
This is the first face of the turtle that was mentioned, except that it has a good work and no risk in it, and another face in the turtle as well, which is to learn from the gallbladder in the shape of a sheet of paper like the As'as we described. Then the gallbladder is raised by three spanners which are divided or a group on this image:
Then the excess part of the gallbladder is cut with a small saw on this image, in equal parts:
If you cannot hold the spanners and do not have a vice, then take a needle and insert it into the middle of the shape and insert another needle near the largest opening and a third one near the smallest opening, and gather the needles between your fingers in equal amounts, then raise them with your hand in a gentle manner.
Then lift the folded skin all as we described, then gather the edges of the wound with the suture and treat it until it is clean, because the hard and rough edges of the cut or incision can be softened by the coral and its surrounding soft tissues.
And the lower gallbladder may also show signs of twisting of its stones, so it is recommended to use what we mentioned of cuts, sutures, and turpentine fire and strong medicine, or strong medicine and suture and suture in them, make them.
The translation of the excerpt from the 10th century Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis is: "The operation on the urethra is performed in this manner, which involves bending the penis and dividing the division that is inside it as described. Then, two or three thin strips are made or woven, with their length being equal to the length of the urethra and their width being less than the width of a needle.
The translation of the excerpt from the 10th century Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis is: "And I cut on both sides of both halves where the threads stick together, then they are gently gathered on the eye socket and the two strips from both halves are tightened and narrowed and left for a few days because the dead and decaying skin peels off and turns black.
The translation of the excerpt from the 10th century Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis is: "Until it falls on its own, if it is tightened with threads, then it is treated until it is free, and if the scar does not increase the width of the urethra and the eyes have not been closed, and this is the appearance of the strips made in this way and this quantity in length and width as follows:
The translation of the excerpt from the 10th century Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis is: "Chapter Twelfth.
The translation of the excerpt from the 10th century Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis is: "When lifting the tightened skin from the eye with the forceps.
The translation of the excerpt from the 10th century Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis is: "If the skin or skins are working in that case, then use a thin forceps and insert a thread made of fine silk into it. Then gather the ends and tie them with a gentle knot as tight as possible, so that the length of the thread is about the size of a bean.
The surgeon then places another fine thread in the socket, bending its sides as desired. Then the barber inserts the forceps into the excess hair follicle through the socket.
She then pulls it out through the skin with the comb until the natural hair is exposed, then the thread is drawn up over the socket and inserted into the socket that hair if it is one or two or three or more.
Then pull it out with your hand until the hair is exposed with the socket in the skin along with the natural hair if you pulled the socket down with the thread but did not pull the hair with it, then pull the socket down with the thread that you were seated in until it comes out of the highest beak.
Then she puts the hair back in and pulls it up until it rises in the highest beak and you see it with your eye, at which point the socket and thread are removed and the eye is closed and left open for a day or three until the hair finds its place and fattening meat grows on it.
If the hair is short, either add long hair from the natural hair and it will rise with it, or leave it until it grows after some time, then lift it.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the treatment of the woman who has a swelling in the upper eyelid.
This swelling is called an epithelioma, which can be either primary or secondary. The secondary type is caused by the accumulation of blood from a wound, cut, or similar cause.
The operation involves draining the blood and separating the wound edges, leaving a layer of white tissue between them. It is not advisable to use drying and compressing substances in the treatment of this swelling.
If you perform this operation, the swelling will return more severely than before and you should use substances that evaporate like henna and cotton soaked in water that has been boiled and mixed with white wax, eucalyptus oil, and something from the camphor family. Mix it and apply it to the wound.
The treatment should be carried out with all possible caution not to damage the tissue that was on it before, and this operation we mentioned is only a part of repairing the swelling and not to return the place to its original state as it was before the swelling.
The fourteenth chapter.
In the treatment of the prolapse of the uterus that is in the lower part of the pelvis.
This prolapse of the womb that is from the lower part is called the true prolapse and is natural and is descent, and descent is from a cut or a hole or such like.
The method of operation is to take a catheter with a thin thread and pass it through the meat and withdraw it from the right to the left until the thread is in both sides of the meat, then stretch the meat with the catheter and cut it with a wide blade.
And if the shape of the pelvis returns to what it should be, or else a gusset is taken and placed on the site of the cut and bends the pelvis and makes two cuts in the inner side of the pelvis and the sides of the cuts are perpendicular to the cuts that were made until they meet then they will form a right angle. Until it becomes like this shape:
And it is the Greek letter, then take away that part of the meat as much as the lower side of it below the pelvis, then join the separated parts with two threads that are woven with a copper thread and treat it as we mentioned from the feminine drugs and the fel and until it is cleared.
When the thigh is exposed from the knee or groin, it is recommended to make a simple incision without removing the hair of the scars as well, as mentioned earlier. Then, separate the two parts with a spatula as we have mentioned.
Regarding the treatment of the thigh if it is above or below, the work should be done according to what suits your condition of the thigh. Indeed, it may have many differences in appearance, and the surgeon must decide on the direction of the incision.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or approaches it, and the same disease indicates what is suitable for the work and tools in most cases.
Chapter 14.
In the tension of closing the eyelid with the sewing needle or the quill.
This operation may be unfamiliar to many people because it involves sewing the upper eyelid with egg whites of the eye to prevent its easy movement and hinder its natural actions. Therefore, it is recommended to enter the fourth finger under the eyelid.
And lift it up or stretch it with a needle then cut the stitching with a fine scissors that is not sharp but is slightly blunted to avoid injuring the eye with the scissors, and your cut will be as if you are closing the wound.
It is predicted that even if the cornea returns to its natural position and separates all adhesions, it will then contain salty water which is washed over it or applied with a swab from the Zangaree gum solution, and then the cornea and the eye will be separated by a thin line of white.
A piece of glass covered with egg white is placed above the eye, and after the third day, the Zangaree gum swabs are used until it is completely removed.
The 13th section.
In cutting the carrot and taking the meat of the bones.
The carrot is either nervous, resembling a hard, thin slice of dough, or not nervous, resembling dry white paste when touched with copper or if it has been cut with a knife.
A knife has not been used in it, and both types start from the largest corner and continue to cover the eye until the light is blocked and the movement of the eye is stopped. The work in cutting it is to place the handle of the razor at the edge of your chisel.
Then he opens his eyes and raises the cornea with his hand, then covers it with a small razor and spreads it over the top, and takes a hair from the horse or cow's beard, makes a strong scratch on one side of the razor, and rubs it in the middle of the carrot.
A surgical procedure is performed using a probe, tying off the tail with a silk thread, pulling it up to the shoulder opposite the incision as if spreading it with the silk to the other shoulder, then cutting the remaining parts at the base of the wound with a fine blade or a small blade, and applying the natural meat to the wound.
To prevent the wound from oozing blood, and the tail has been stretched either by the needle or by the thread as we said, then it is smoothened with the rough blade of the other side:
To prevent the blade from piercing the chest wall, and if it happens that the wound is infected, then on the following day it is treated with something appropriate to remove the remaining parts:
If the tail is not sensitive and could not enter with a probe or not hold with a needle, this type of tail is often treated with drugs to remove it as described in the division, and if you want to cut it, open the eye of the scissors:
Take a fine rough blade with a weak edge as shown in this image: Excise the tumor above with gentleness, as I see it flickers and trembles, and the incision only causes a moment's discomfort in the eye from the Zinjari or red ginger, or salt solution, and the eye becomes completely closed by the next day.
Then, operate on it until all of it is removed, except if you feel resistance in the eye and remove it forcefully, and treat the hot tumor until it is expelled, and then re-operate on it with the incision until it is expelled, and as for the meat of the wound.
If the wound causes discomfort in the eye, tie it with a string and cut a small piece of it, do not hesitate to cut, otherwise there will be tears, and then scrape it in the red or Zinjari ginger until it is expelled.
The 17th chapter.
In cutting the ginger and the excess meat that grows in the eye.
Some people may have red, overgrown meat in their eyes that covers the eye or hangs down and maybe turns into galls outside and resembles ginger.
The operation involves placing the scissors' head in your stone, then opening your eyes and catching all of that red meat with the appropriate pins.
Tie it with a bandage or gauze, then cut the first piece of meat until all of it is cut and preserve the eye to avoid injuring it during the operation. The cut can be made with either the scalpel we described in the gutting section or a small knife. Like how the rope catches its image in the window that is to the left of this one, this window.
If all the tendons are cut and they all go into the eye, fill it with coarse salt or sprinkle red veins of medicinal drugs on it and hold a white egg shell over the eye from outside to prevent the tumor from becoming hot.
If there is something left of the tendons and the blood flows and the tumor becomes hot, leave the eye and treat it with what keeps the tumor at peace, then reopen it with the operation until it is clean, and also make from the excess meat that is presented in this kind.
But it is better for you to avoid treating weak eyes by writing or by cutting with the knife and do not insert your hand into anything of these tools until you see that this organ is possible for this operation.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the case of the eyeball.
The blood vessels of the eye become congested and burst, causing loss of vision and weakening the eye over time. It is therefore advisable that you first rest your eye if the eye in which the vessels are located is strong and has not had any other disease besides the congestion.
Then, the order is to command the patient to place his head in your stone and then tie those blood vessels with one or two knots according to your preference, and the knots should be gentle on this image.
Or, the knots can be two separate ones in the body on this image.
Then, gently tie those blood vessels with a soft cloth and wipe the blood away until you see the eye, and the blood vessels will come out of it and the blood will be absorbed, and preserve the eye from hurting it with the edges of the cloth, and your work should be half the day away from the sun.
And make sure in your work that you do not cut anything other than those blood vessels when you are free, as the green or red eye will eat up what remains of the congestion, and if you cannot fix all of it in that hour, close the eye with what soothes the eye pain.
Wait until the pain subsides and the burn heals, then resume work on this side until this image of the former wound is erased from it.
Make the original of the pupil in the apprentice's stone, and the rest will flow from it, and close the eye with fixed or triangular openings that hold them, like a relief.
If the eye is swollen, make the original of the pupil in the apprentice's stone, and the rest will flow from it, and close the eye with fixed or triangular openings that hold them, like a relief. If the upper eyelid is swollen, start by making two holes on the highest part of the eyelid, one of which should be in the inner corner and the other in the outer corner.
If the lower eyelid is swollen, hold the opening between the middle and the outer corner, then tie ribs of it underneath, and hold it between your thumb and little finger, until all the sutures are cut, either from the westernmost point or from the lifting point of the needle.
If the patient is crying, press on their chest and hold all the sutures until they rise on the moll and do not cut the tear, as the tear and the blood will flow (be excreted) on you.
He then cut the blade from above and below, until there remains only the neck, which is in the coronary artery, unless it can be raised from the coronary artery by the mallet, in which case it is better and may fracture in some people.
If the blade was broken, it would heal in a few days and the tumor would become harder, then the work would be repeated on it.
The 14th chapter.
To the nose, after cutting the blade.
The surgeons call it a nose-gouging, if they treat it by cutting or with the sharp corrosive drug as described and it does not heal, then there is no cure in it except to scrape over the tumor when it grows and remove all the moisture or dryness that is in it.
Until the bone comes out, if the bone comes out and you see in it blackness or whiteness, cut it off with this instrument: .
The drill is called the head, made of Indian iron, with a round head like a hammer that has been pounded, or the file that has been pounded in a thin way. It is placed on the edge of the bone, and you twist it between your fingers, while you keep your hand clean until you learn that this decay has occurred.
Do it several times, then force the position with purging drugs that constrict. If the position closes and fat appears in the meat, cut off the time and it will remain for forty days without renewal or harm.
Know that it is cured, or else there is no remedy but to apply the nail of the thumb to this point, which is to reveal the bone twice with iron or medicine: if the bone is revealed, take a stimulant on this appearance.
The iron will be like a comb, with its bristles turned towards the side as you see, then place it on the bone itself and it should be near the elbow and slightly away from your eye, then draw your hand with the stimulant until the bone is revealed and it will be felt by the touch.
If the wind comes out of its mouth when you grasp it with your hand, then force the position with purging drugs as I have informed you. If fat appears and the place becomes firm, the material that was inserted outside returns to the nose, and it will be better for the patient if Allah willing.
Chapter 20.
Treatment of the Eye's Cornea
If the eye is injured and there is no loss of vision, it is recommended to apply a cold compress. Then, remove it and place a soft, clean cloth in the affected area. Apply a thin layer of ointment.
Then, apply a paste made of gauze, butter, and onion to the eye. Afterwards, close the eyelid over the eyeball with many pledgets of ruffs, which are made of many threads. The ruffs should be heated until they become yellowish and burn the entire thread on four threads.
Then, place one on top of the other until the eye requires it. Close it with a firm, strong nip and repeat the ointment from the cloth without any conditions. Then, remove the ointment and let the eye be exposed to day and night.
If the muscle relaxes during this process, it is recommended to close it again the next day and night. If the eye has not returned to its original state, repeat the ointment, ruffs, heat, and cloth until it returns.
Chapter 20: The Last Chapter
Cutting the Onion
When presented with a fracture in the ribcage, I decided to expose it and reveal the shape of the bone. Therefore, I performed the operation on this part for the purpose of describing it.
The procedure involves inserting an instrument into the rib from the bottom to the top, then inserting another instrument into it with a thin blade from the medial side and extracting it. The first instrument is then left in its place.
Then, the incision is cut along the blade and tied to some ribs around the instrument. It is then removed and a piece of gauze soaked in egg white is placed on the eye to catch the threads with the ribs. The eye is then treated to strengthen it.
Until the wound is cleaned out, and the ribs may break from all sides in a circular pattern until the eye becomes larger. Then it is closed with a fine suture that reaches the corner of the eye, allowing the egg white to drip out and the eye to drain and lie on the chest. It is then strengthened until the wound is completely healed.
The second part of the chapter.
In treating a fracture.
This is the fracture, known as the cornu, which is a period of time when it comes together in the eye that resembles falling water and not with it. The purpose of the operation is to place the splint on a movable chair and then take the head of the bone with your hands from both sides.
He should be moved so that the time appears to be going down at your eye, and then it will remain fixed and does not disappear, and light will shine and things will be seen as they were seen, and if the time does not go down below the eye, we know that it is water, and if it does not become calm, the time of descending will not be as we have mentioned.
Or else, sit the patient between your hands, then take a thin, wet cloth and rub it lightly over the cornea at the contact point of the drop with the cornea in the eye until the substance comes out.
If only water comes out of the eye, it is hot and has mixed in it sugar or water that was heated with honey and sugar, then treat with other remedies until it is cleared.
The third section of the thirtieth part.
We have mentioned the types of water in the division and which one is suitable for the container by a simple, explicative phrase, so it should be taken from there for health. Therefore, it is recommended that the patient sits between your hands with the eye facing the light near the sun.
And fasten the correct eye and make it strong, then raise the eyelid of the eye with your right hand if it is the left eye or with your left hand if it is the right eye.
The surgeon then places the eye socket close to the incision with great force, from the same whitish substance of the eye from the smallest side, then pushes the eye socket with force and controls it with your hand until it passes through the white of the eye and you feel that the eye socket has reached something empty.
It is preferred that the distance the eye socket has traveled be equal to the distance from the inner corner of the eyebrow to the outer corner of the iris, as the nasal bone is seen by the same observer who saw the eye, for the purpose of cleaning the cornea. Then, the eye socket is pushed up to the position where the water is.
Then, the eye socket is closed once or twice, and if the water drains from its container, the inner corner of the eye will see what opens to its sight from its container, and the eye socket will remain for a little while until the water rises again without the eye socket coming out.
If it remains still and does not rise, pull out the eye socket a little at a time with your hand and let it dissolve in the water a small amount of pure salt from inside, then clean the eye with it from inside, and then place all of it outside, either wrapped in cloth or covered with plaster.
Bind the wound with linen and white bandage, and as for us and our contemporaries, we place powdered kaboon with egg white on it, because if the eye socket does not enter the eye due to its hardness, there is someone whose eye is very hard. It is recommended that the surgeon, known as the barber, should take this appearance into consideration.
He should only use the blade and avoid cutting, as it is best to approach the shave with a gentle angle, then insert the blade where we mentioned, and after completing the shave, make the patient lie down on his back in a dark room to sleep.
He should refrain from all movements and vomiting, and make his food as natural as possible, without turning his head to the right or left. The pulse should be taken every day for three days, and it should be observed in that dark room.
He should observe things and then withdraw the pulse to the seventh day, but it is not recommended to do this during treatment or after shaving, as it is best to avoid this before the water rises quickly with a severe look.
If the tumor is hot and swollen, it is recommended to examine the eye before the seventh day and treat it with whatever is inside the tumor until it is completely removed. Then, remove the pulse and put a scarf under the chin that covers the pulse from below for several days in that dark room.
A gradual departure from the house is made, and it is treated according to its causes, and know that the surgeon cannot do without observing the patient several times in such cases, he presents the operation, and I have heard that some Iraqis say that he makes a clay pot that absorbs water.
I have never seen such a thing in our country, nor read about it in any of the early books, and it may be a fabrication, and here is a picture of some types of clay pots that one can stand on due to their ignorance:
It is made of clay specifically and has a rounded shape with a sharp edge on one side.
The fourth chapter and twentieth section.
In the treatment of dried meat in the nose.
It may grow in the nose of different dried meats, something similar to many-legged spiders, and from it there is cancerous tumor that resembles a yellow pigment and from it there is non-yellow cancerous tumor.
If this meat is not cancerous and not carcinogenic, it would be better to place the needle between your fingers and open it and insert the solder into that meat, then pull it out and cut what you have grasped with a sharp, narrow needle from one side.
Until you know that all the meat is cooked, and there is still something left that you cannot cut, then remove it with one of the slicing tools until nothing remains. If the blood flows or the wound is hot.
If it is a wound from an unclean member, then cut it off immediately until the blood stops flowing, and all meat will pass through the nose after being cut, and a drop of water or drink will follow. If the nose opens and moisture follows from the throat to the neck.
If it is clear, then know that the wound has healed, if moisture does not reach what should be, then know that meat has spoiled inside the bones that were broken and the tool did not reach the cuts there, in this case it is necessary to take a piece of flax from it for some thickness.
And tie it with many knots and make a knot for each one, and the wound will twist the single blade of the hand in the nose with water or what can be made like a ring and attracts the wind until it reaches the nostril.
And it will come out of the nostril and does many things like this action of children in books, which is easy for those who want it, then gather the two ends of the blade that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
In the next step, you will use a bone saw to cut the meat until you learn that the meat has been cut by the bone saw. Then, remove the bone and let it remain in the nose for three days or more after washing away the blood it has absorbed from the Egyptian mortar.
Until the lead tube in the nose has consumed all remaining meat, then the next thing to appear in the nose is a lead tube that needs to be emptied, and if you need treatment to dry it out, use that.
This is a picture of the turbinate that cuts the adenoids and drugs in the nose:
A small piece of silver or a near-cantharidal pin is placed with the hole open and the shaft also.
If you want to make the tube closed like a pipe and the turbinate cutting surface flat,
it has a clamp at the end so that it holds if you melt in it the grease or any ointments or things that are sticky,
The fifth and twentieth section.
In the navel of the nose, in the throat.
Many times, there is a growth in the nose that becomes larger and increases over time until it disappears from sight.
Therefore, it is recommended to cut it at its first appearance and remove all of them. Then, either the cauterizing ointment or the ointment for the place where the cauterization was done should be applied, as cutting it until it becomes hard and rigid like the color of the skin is not necessary.
Do not expose it to lead, as it is a cancerous growth and I have often seen that after cutting it, a large ulcer appears on the patient. If the growth is not the mouth of the gland and you see that cutting it does not cause any harm. Remove the growth carefully and cut it without hesitation, and dress the area with what soothes and draws out until it is clean.
Chapter 62.
In the treatment of the nose, nasal cavity, and ear. If the connection is severed from the wound or in a similar way, know that when the connection is severed in any of these noses, the work done is only beneficial for some people.
It is recommended to expose it when it is necessary, and look if the wound is deep in his blood to gather the edges of the wound with the bandage and treat it until it is clean, and if the connection is severed, it has been severed from its edges and all of them are correct, then it is recommended to cut all of them with a sharp knife until they bleed.
The surgeon then collects the incisions with silk and applies gheon and lard as a remedy, placing something above the wounds for a day or three, then fills them.
And the drug is changed and left until the threads break on their own, then the wound is treated with gheon until it is cleaned, and the surgeon's advice that the silk should unite the disconnection either by the corset as we explained in abdominal surgery or by the thread as you have seen here.
The seventh and thirtieth section.
In the extraction of the nail that is exposed in the incisions.
Many people may have small, hard nails inside their mouths that resemble some of them to the skin and some are smaller and larger, so it is recommended that you turn the cheek and pass over each nail and tie it with the needle.
And cut them from both sides, then cover the position after cutting with a piece of gheon until the blood stops, then it is mixed with the salt and the wounds are treated with what is in the scissors to clean the incisions.
The eighth and thirtieth section.
In surgery, when there is excess meat in the throat.
In many cases, meat grows on the throat, which is called the first abscess. It is better to tie it with a string or wrap it with a cloth and cut it at its root, allowing time for blood to flow or apply a dressing.
Or if it is one of the scarred, dry ducts, this meat returns after treatment, but it often does not return after cutting it twice and closing it, as it does not return after the stitch.
The ninth and tenth chapters.
In tooth extraction using iron.
Sometimes, sharp, dry warts gather on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the throat and neck. These warts may spread and turn black, causing damage to the throat and making the teeth appear black.
It is best to place the plaster between your hands and the patient's head on the marble and cleanse the wart and the surrounding area until nothing remains, and do the same with the white and brown and gray and other similar substances until it is clean.
For this reason, whatever is in it, either the tooth will be extracted again on another day and a second and third time until you achieve what you want, and know that the wart requires many different types of plasters with various shapes according to what suits your work.
In order for the knife that removes the tumor from within to be different from the one that removes it from outside, and to remove it between the layers, there are several images of cutting that you will all have:...
The thirtieth chapter.
Tooth extraction.
It is preferred to treat the tooth with pain by all means and spare its extraction, for if it is extracted, it will not be replaced, as it is a sacred core even if it was not meant to be extracted.
If the dentist insists on extracting the tooth, wait until the painful tooth is healed. Many times, the dentist deceives the patient, thinking that he is in a healthy tooth and extracts it, but the pain does not go away until the sick tooth is extracted, as we have seen with the barbers many times.
If the painful tooth is in its place, then it is preferred to apply pressure around the gum with a finger or a spoon or a little bit of the nail until the swelling subsides from all sides.
Then, the large dog's teeth can be removed easily, and the dentist's head will be between your shoulders, as it has been anchored there, so that the tooth does not move, unless it comes out, in which case, take one of those instruments and insert it under him from all sides with a gentle movement, as you did before.
If the hip is bent or expanded, it is recommended to fill that socket with a fracture and reinforce it with a good plate at the thin edge of the acetabulum, so as not to weaken it while you are applying the Khalifi screws and it is advisable to excavate around the hip from all sides.
Preserve your effort so as not to break it, some of it will remain on the graft and return to the original donor with a greater pain than the first one, and you should not make what the Hajjams do in their bridges and preparations for the conquest without using what we have described.
Many people often talk about a great pain that is easier to break the hip and leave some of its roots intact or part of it. Or, some bones of the pelvis may be cut off as we have seen many times, then it is swollen after cutting with water or with a mixture of blood and salt, and there is often a lot of bleeding from the site, so something from the wound was taken to the site and was put on it.
Or, if the Khalifi screw does not benefit you, the first image of the Khalifi screw that moves the hip or is short-legged with a sharp end will not break at your grip on the hip, and this is the image of the large Khalifi screws:
Make the corners as pronounced as possible, even if you hold them, do not release them and do not shorten the sides, and make it of Indian iron or of well-cut wood with open sides and in the other direction, some parts enter into each other, they should be held firmly and securely, making a tight and short grip.
And the sides can be made in the shape of a bend, making them also easy to adjust.
The ninth and thirtieth section.
In the middle of the original parts and the removal of broken ribs of the pelvis.
If the fragment remains at the edge of the fracture, it is best to place a cloth soaked in oil on the site for a day or two until the site is relaxed, then insert the needle or the clavicle. The bone is similar to the wing of the bird called the clavicle, and this is a picture of the clavicle.
If you have made it like a bend or like an iron, and you do not need to remove this clavicle, it is best to dig on the original part and remove all the meat with the hammer, then insert the device that resembles a small iron ring, as shown in this picture:
Keep the incision shallow and not too wide, otherwise it may tear. For if the original part comes out like this, or if you use other instruments such as the one that divides the flap slightly in some parts:
another division:
and we may also use this other instrument with the two edges like this:
and there are other instruments and edges mentioned in the book, and we may also use this one that resembles the large scapel as follows:
Divide the flap slightly with a blunt edge, and keep it not too wide, and know that there are many instruments for surgery and other tools are also countless, and the maker of the scalpel may invent tools according to what he sees in his work and diseases themselves.
Because not all diseases are mentioned for their types, and if a bone of the jaw or a bone of the mouth is broken or torn, search for it in its place with one of these instruments or forceps that were mentioned in the exit of the origins.
In this excerpt, Albucasis emphasizes the importance of observing and understanding the patient's condition before performing any surgical procedure. He highlights the need for careful examination and analysis of the patient's symptoms, which will guide the surgeon in determining the appropriate course of action.
In this section, Albucasis explains the process of removing a small piece of bone. He advises the surgeon to carefully excise the bone, ensuring that it does not fall out until it is completely separated from the surrounding tissue. Afterward, the surgeon should clean and prepare the area for further treatment.
The 22nd and 32nd sections of the book.
In publishing the inert ashes on their own, without mixing them with other materials.
When the ashes have grown on their own, without natural growth, they become unsightly and especially so when it occurs in women and children. In such cases, one should carefully examine the ashes, as they may have grown from behind another ash.
If the ashes have not been published or dried, they should be removed. If they are attached to another piece of ash, they can be cut using this tool.
The tool resembles a small hammer and should be made of hard Indian iron. It should be sharpened regularly to maintain the stability of the ashes and prevent damage to other ashes. If the ash is dry, it can be dried using an Indian oven with this tool.
The entire incision should be made from the right side, with a fine curved blade, such as that used for making incisions in the abdomen. The wound should be made gradually, over several days, to prevent the abdominal muscles from tearing. After the incision is made, it should be cleaned and dressed.
If any of the intestines has torn from it, it is best to also cut it away, until the raw edge has healed and the wound has closed, so that it does not irritate the throat and do not impair speech.
The third part of the book is about surgery.
In tying the moving intestines with gold threads or silver threads.
If the anterior intestines are tense and move away from the wound or fall down, and the patient cannot bear anything to touch them, they should be treated with antiseptic drugs, but the treatment did not help.
The solution is to tie the intestines with a gold or silver thread, and silver is better because gold corrodes and swells over time, while silver does not, and the thread should be of medium thickness and length, as it can stretch between the intestines.
The surgeon should take the suture and insert it between the correct incisions, then cut the suture's ends between the moving edges until the suture reaches the correct incision from the other side.
Then, return the suture to the side from which it began and guide your hand carefully until the knot does not move and the stronger end of the suture is at the corners of the incisions so that it does not come out, then cut the ends of the stronger suture by the scissors, gather them together, twist them with your fingers, and hide them between the correct and moving incisions.
To prevent the tongue from becoming swollen, then leave it as it is, for if it has swelled or has been cut, reinforce it with another suture. Enjoy this entire process, and this is a picture of the incisions and their correct and moving positions as you see:
The incisions may swell or move back to their original position as described, and this is done by a skilled surgeon who can make a bone from the ribcage and place it in the correct position of the incision. He should remain and enjoy this.
The Fourth Chapter Thirty.
In the cut made under the tongue to prevent speech.
This cut under the tongue may be natural, born with the human, or it may be a wounding cut.
The operation involves opening the mouth and head of the animal in your hand, raising the tongue, and then cutting the nerve cut with a wounding cut until the tongue comes out of the socket. If there is some firmness and knotting in it, and it was caused by a wound, the cut should be made deeper and the nerve cut should be made deeper until the nerve is exposed and the clamp is released.
Be careful not to cut too deep in the meat, as it may cut a vessel and cause bleeding, then let it ooze with water or cold grape juice, and then place under the tongue a piece of cat's whiskers that the animal holds in its mouth every night.
Do not let it bleed twice, as if there is a wound causing blood to flow, apply a poultice of a herb that stops the bleeding. The herb should be in a container that can contain the blood. Then he treats him with other remedies until he is cleansed.
The 5th chapter of the 34th part.
In the extraction of the tongue-depressor that emerged under the chin.
It may occur under the chin and a swelling resembling a small tongue depressor that prevents the tongue from performing its natural function and may cause bones to grow until the mouth is filled, and the action of opening the mouth of the patient by turning away from the sun and looking at the tumor.
If I see it as a yellow or black hard object without affecting the tongue, do not expose it because it is cancer and if it is inclined towards the white side in it, there is moisture in it and the nail is in it with a soft point and straightens it from all sides.
If the blood in your work area, apply a piece of gauze soaked in ointment until it stops bleeding, then return to your work and complete it until it is fully excreted, and then it will become moist with salt and water.
Then treat him with other compatible remedies until he is cleansed.
The 6th chapter of the 34th part.
In the treatment of the tumors of the lozenges.
And what appears in the throat from other tumors may be seen inside the throat as glands resembling the glands that are exposed from outside and are called lozenges if they are treated with what mentioned in the division, they were not cleansed.
Observe that if the tumor is hard, like a piece of colorless glass, it will not be affected by iron. If it is red in color and has a strong odor, do not expose it to iron for fear of bleeding. Leave it until it heals, either by cutting it out or by spontaneously healing from within.
If the white color is soft and its origin is fine, this should be cut. The operation involves looking beforehand if the tumor has been in stasis or if there are some deficiencies in it.
Then, place the lancet in your hand, with the sun's rays on it, open its mouth, and take a servant between your hands, and use this device to clean its tongue from bottom to top.
Make a fence or a handle of silver or copper that is thin like a spoon. If you uncover the tongue and reveal the tumor to your sight, take a needle and insert it into the wound and draw it out without anything else coming out except for the needle.
Then, cut it with this device, which resembles a scissors but has diverging edges. The mouth of each blade is held by the other blade, firmly and sharply, made from Indian steel or Damascus steel.
In the event that this machine is not prepared and otherwise, simply cut it with this ruler.
If the incision is made from one side and not from the other, then after cutting the first incision, cut the second one on this type of cut, and then wet the blade with cold water or snow and water.
If the bleeding is caused by the tearing of the veins, gaskets, or sheets, or similar parts of the stitches until the bleeding stops, then treat it to clean it, and there may be other wounds that were not cut during the cutting of the stitches, so cut them according to what was mentioned in the cutting of the stitches, whether.
A woman who had a wound that had grown inside her stitch, which was causing discomfort, barely noticed that it might close the stitch. The woman was breathing from a narrow passage and it prevented her from eating and drinking water.
She had applied poultices for a day or two, and the wound had grown to two branches from her nose, so she started rubbing one of them with a pound of burnt clay, then attracted it to a suitable piece.
He then cut it where he recognized the angle of the nose, then did this with the other angle of the nose, then opened its mouth and tied its tongue, then inserted the suture in the same tumor, then cut some of it but did not remove any blood that flowed from it.
He cut the woman's nail and she started drinking water from her time, then she ate and we did not cut from that tumor for a long time, and the tumor left behind instead of cutting until it was completely gone along with her.
He opened the tumor inside the nail and stopped increasing, then he moved away from that side and I do not know what God did with it afterward.
The seventh chapter and thirty-second.
In cutting the tumor of the woman.
If the tumor of the woman's nail fell down and spread out and was white and straight, it is called a beam, and if it was thick at the bottom and curved, it is called a gallbladder. If it was treated as we mentioned in the division, the treatment did not work.
I saw the hot tumor leave her and it was thin, so it should be cut off and there was no curved part of it and it did not have length, it was not bloody or had a long color or was black and there was no sign of it, so it should be avoided to cut it.
In the case of a wound on the lip, it is advisable when you see it on the scale mentioned from its thickness and length to place the patient in the position of the sun with the mouth covered by the instrument that describes it, then the surgeon should sharpen the scalpel in the bowl.
And draw it down and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned for cutting the eyebrows, and it is recommended not to cut from it except the one that exceeds the natural one without anything else because if you cut from it you will suffer more from sound and speech.
Then after cutting, use what we described for cutting the eyebrows and treat it until it is clean, because the fat of the lip on cutting it, it is recommended to use the saw in its place without fear and without hesitation, and the face of it is that it is with the drug and it is that you put the head of the lip in your stone.
Then you cover the mouth with the instrument we mentioned, then take from the hot water that we mentioned in the chapter of the drug and wet a non-abrasive brush and make it neither rough nor thin and fill this tool with this ointment and this is its image and its form:
Its side that you put the drug in should have the ointment of a spoonful, and place the instrument with the drug on itself and the lip is leaning on its side so that the hair does not fall from inside its ring lest something harsh enters it.
Afterwards, keep your hand covered with the drug and let it dry for half an hour until it becomes black and absorbs the drug, and if you wish to use a cloth, tear it into strips and dip it in the drug and wring out the cloth in the drug.
Then, insert the rod with the cloth into the tube until the cloth sticks to the drug and do this repeatedly until you reach the desired length of the cloth. Then leave it, as it will swell and become shiny after three days or four, if you wish to renew the drug, prepare it again.
Then, scrape around the wound with a damp cloth and remove the drug that surrounds it, then let it freeze with cold water and treat from outside with threads and inside with gauze until it is cleared, this type of treatment is preferred over cutting and is farther from fear.
The wound can also be treated with what is most preferred over cutting and cutting, it is treated with a decoction of the following ingredients: fenugreek, horse-radish, ginger, senna, aloe, and similar plants from the laxative family, they are all collected together or some of them in a jar and immersed in water.
The text describes a surgical instrument consisting of a point or pin embedded in the middle of a covering, with a device attached to it. This device is made of gold or silver.
The text describes a surgical procedure involving inserting a tool with a hole into the mouth of a tumor until steam rises through the tube and fills the cavity, then repeating this process multiple times until the tumor is compressed. This is to be done as soon as possible after the tumor is detected.
The text describes a situation where the tumor may grow larger, and it is recommended to perform this procedure when the tumor's base is hot. If the necessary instrument is not available, a small incision can be made in the opposite side of the mouth with a sharp egg white to prevent burning of the mouth.
The text states that using a small piece of egg white prevents the hot steam from burning the mouth and is an effective treatment method along with safety.
This is the eighth and thirtieth section.
The text describes removing the tumor and any growths in the duct without using this method.
The text states that often, growths such as bones or tumors appear in the duct. It is recommended to remove whatever appears visible after the mouth is closed with the instrument under the sun.
The excerpt discusses the importance of understanding the contents of a chapter, and if something is not visible or hidden in the chapter, it is recommended to clarify the doubt before consuming food in the stomach as soon as possible. Otherwise, the following things may leave the stomach quickly or the doubt may be cleared by a small piece or a brief explanation.
Or a piece of bread that is dry or a slice of light white fish may be swallowed, and it is tied with a thread, and then it is swallowed. If it reaches the position of the neck, the thread will quickly attract it many times.
The neck or the jaw often ties the thread or bone in it and comes out, and if it does not come out with what we mentioned, then use a device made of lead on this image:
The mouth should be larger than the gulley, and on its side, there should be a contraction that the doubt enters into the chapter while raising his head and preserving from the sharpness of his neck so as not to cause vomiting and push it with the bone or the neck, or the doctor can enter his hand.
And allowing the doubt to enter into it is better for understanding the position of the following thing and pushing it down or attracting his hand with a device up to the extent that he feels comfortable until it comes out.
Chapter 9 and 32nd Section.
In the concluding sentence of the paragraph.
If you treated the wound as we mentioned in the division of treatment with drugs and it did not heal, then look at the chapter of the ulcer under the sun after his tongue has been washed with the instrument that was described to you.
If you see the ulcer with your eyes, attract it with a small flame or with a gentle touch of a wet cloth, and if it does not manage to heal, then take a bent tube and insert it into the ulcer near the ulcer, then insert a protected iron into the tube that has been heated in the fire.
Do this several times until the ulcer dries out the water on that day, then take a cold drink filled with water and open his mouth in it and swallow it without any drop being left and move the water with his hand after that.
If the ulcer falls on the ground when you feel the water, and if it does not come out as we described, then the wound will dry with the bolus and the bolus of the instrument that was described in the book of God, then do this several times because it falls.
The working in the oven is to take a vessel with a hot iron that has been heated in the fire and wrap it with a cloth in the middle of it, put the handle of the instrument on that side, then put the oven in his mouth and place the ulcer in the tube's mouth and close his mouth until he knows that the oven has reached the wound.
When the stitch falls off from the wound, if it does not fall off, the blister reforms multiple times and the patient endures thirst and eats salt and onions and does not drink water. Therefore, this treatment must be performed, and this is a picture of the device that attracts the stitch from the thread if the blister falls on it.
It resembles the clavicle except for this detachment it enters into the thread and its wings resemble the white of the egg when it touches something that was not left behind.
Another device used to tie the throat is a wide metal ring that fits over the chin and extends into the mouth, keeping the mouth open without the patient's will and unable to remove it until it loosens.
Description of the device that opens the mouth on this measurement by itself.
The fourth chapter.
In this chapter, he discusses the speech in the wounds and their division.
The wounds are many varieties, depending on what is mentioned in this book and they differ in their speech and division from one side of the tumor itself and what accompanies it with moisture.
The second type of incision is made in the body because the sudden tumor in the head is not the same as the sudden tumor in the pelvis, and the sudden tumor in the fatty tissue is not the same as the sudden tumor in the limb. Each of them has its own rule for the operation.
Among the tumors, only those that should be excised are those in which the bone has fully formed and completed, while others, such as those near the joints, should not be excised because they have not fully formed and completed.
Because the tumor, if it occurs near a joint, can cause the ligaments or nerves of that joint to become damaged, which may lead to the loss of that limb, or the tumor may be near a major organ, causing damage to that organ.
Because if you delay the incision until the bone has fully formed, you may cause damage to the major organ, so it is necessary to excise the tumor completely located near the pelvis before it becomes too soft and spreads into the pelvis, causing a cyst.
And it may not be possible to remove the tumor completely, and it is advisable to learn when to perform the incision on the tumor that has fully formed during quietness, when the pain of the tumor subsides, when the fever goes away, when the swelling decreases, when the head of the tumor expands, and other signs.
It is recommended that the butcher place the knife at the base of the tumor if possible, to make it easier to cut through and reduce the risk of injury. The knife should be inserted along the length of the body if the tumors are located in the hands and feet.
Muscles, tendons, nerves, and ligaments should be cut in all levels without exception, and if they are affected, the knife should be inserted according to that position. If the tumor is located in the meaty areas, it is best to leave the knife.
The gristle should be cut as much as possible, as previously mentioned, because if you cut it beforehand, the knife will make a long and difficult cut, and some tumors may have to be cut on the surface of the body or according to what the organ needs.
For small tumors, use a single knife, and for large tumors, use a wide or many knives according to the size of the tumor. Some tumors may need to be cut if they have become like a crack.
In some cases, it may resemble what is shown in many autopsies and morgues, and among them there are those that cut a three-sided notch and others that cut from it like the shape of a piece of paper.
The text describes the use of different types of incisions in surgery, including the curved and lunate incisions. It suggests that a simple incision should be made if the tumor is not large, but if it is large and has taken a long time to form, it may be necessary to wait for the entire gallbladder to expel its contents before making the incision.
If some of the tumor is removed, it should be left to grow for a while before removing more of the gallbladder. This process should be repeated gradually until all of the tumor has been removed.
However, if the animal is weak or a pregnant woman, a child, or an elderly person, the spirit may leave with the expulsion of the gallbladder and the animal may die. It is important to be cautious and avoid this possibility.
After removing the tumor, it is recommended to clean the wound and observe it. If the wound from the tumor is small or was only a simple incision, use the flax or fine cotton wool to clean it. If the tumor was large and had many incisions, use a different method.
It is recommended to enter into each incision until some of them meet, and if the tumor has cut or scratched the skin in some places, it should be covered with flax or non-moisturized cotton wool and left until the third day.
Then remove and treat it with what is most suitable from the applications until it is clean, for if bleeding is observed during your work, use cold water and vinegar after drinking a drop of vinegar mixed with a piece of crushed vinegar and placing it on the site of the bleeding multiple times.
If the bleeding persists, it is recommended that you use the measures and treatments we have described in many locations of this book and division, and if it is winter and the location of the tumor is rich in nerves, it is recommended to apply warm ointment with hot water to the affected area.
And place them on the site, and if it is summer and the locations are fatty, it is recommended that you apply cold ointment with water and oil or hot oil with water until the third day as we said, it is recommended to remove the tumor and clean it.
And use in treating it what is shaped until it is clean, this is what you need from knowledge of treating tumors on the sentence and as for the detail, you have mentioned all tumors with how to treat them briefly summarized.
Chapter Thirty-Three and Fourth.
In the section on tumors that appear on the scalp.
In the scalp, small bumps are present, which are types of goods stored in baskets that resemble chicken gizzards and have various kinds such as shahmia and others that contain moisture similar to soreness.
And among them is that which contains moisture similar to mushrooms and soup, and others that are hard and porous, and all of them have no risk in the hole and removal without obstructing the hole with a thread.
The operation in the hole is to squeeze it first with the device that comes after the one called the forceps until you learn what it contains, and if it contains moisture, then the hole is a long narrow hole as shown in this image.
Start by making the hole from point ~b~ to point ~j~, and if you drain the moisture, empty the container that contained that moisture, cut it all, and do not leave anything behind, as much as possible, if something remains, it will return often.
Then, dip a cloth in the saltwater, if it is present or not, then fill the wound with it and leave it until the next day, as it will eat what remains of the container, then re-dip the cloth in saltwater twice more if it becomes necessary.
Until you are sure that there is nothing left in the vessel, then treat the wound with a sponge until it is clean, and if the tumor contains fatty substances, cut them off as shown in this image.
Cut the suction tube and all sides of the wound, and push it out through the hollow that contains it. If you encounter a cord, make it as described to you, and also make it in the tumor if it is hard.
The treatment is as described, and cutting the hard tumor is easiest because it has little blood and moisture, and some of these tumors in people's heads have no moisture with them. That's why I cut it off on the tumor.
The head of a old woman had a tumor as hard as chalk, white and small, which could not be crushed even if it was thrown with a stone, and there were no other tumors in her head like this except for the ones in children's heads.
And when cutting the ears, cut them all in a simple way and make the base of the ear lower to facilitate the matter downwards, then treat it according to what suits it from the treatment.
The second and twentieth chapter.
In the shoulder, the carpal bones that are exposed in the neck are often exposed in the neck and below the shoulder girdles, and also in the ribs. There is one that is exposed in the neck, and there are many of them. Some of them are born from others.
And each of these bones is in a separate box for it, just like in the markets, and the skull bones as we described, and the types of these bones are many of them curved, some of them contain moisture, and some of them are harmful and do not respond to treatment.
And what I saw of it was a good sign in touch, and its appearance was near the color of the skin, moving to all directions without being connected to the nerve of the neck, nor to the wound, nor to the cord, nor was it empty. It is recommended to cut it in a simple way from above to below the body in this shape from line ~j~ to line ~b~.
And it is recommended to dry it from all sides and stretch the skin edges with astringent or astringents or many strings as we said in the skull bones and exit little by little and be on the neck so that it does not cut any vein or nerve, and the sewer be not too much.
Do not extend your hand beyond the cut, do not worry about the bleeding, if you have cut a vein or artery, close the wound with a piece of cloth or some pieces of reeds that cut the blood.
Close the wound until the tumor has grown and the wound has healed and stopped bleeding, then return to your work until it is empty, then clean it with your thumb if there are still small pieces left, and cut them off and clean them.
If the main artery is a large vein, it is better not to cut the gallbladder from its original place but rather to tie it with a thin and long cotton thread and leave it until it falls by itself without causing any harm, then clean the wound with a piece of cotton that has been soaked in the Egyptian ointment and then treat it.
If you have cut the gallbladder completely, it is best to gather the wound and clean it every hour after knowing that there is no remaining fever, as I saw that there was still a fever in the gallbladder.
It is best to cut it at its root and empty it, and use the scalpel and what we mentioned, and there was no humor in the gallbladder, so you can cut it simply where you see the position of its growth, and make the cut as below what we said.
After the knife with the Egyptian mace, you use it to eat whatever remains of the spoil until you see the wound healed and then treat it with the boiling hams until it is clean.
The third chapter, forty-third.
In the section on the gallbladder, about the inflammation that occurs inside the gallbladder.
I mentioned this section in the gallbladder first, but I have not seen anyone make it in our country, and this is the style of their talk, and those who slaughter should avoid this section because they do not benefit from it.
In order for all the organs and the lungs to be inflamed, and those who have inflammation in their stomachs or gallbladders or loins if it is not in the gallbladder, it is necessary to use this section of the gallbladder to avoid the pain that comes from choking.
It is preferable if we want to do this under three circles of the gallbladder or four small sections in front of two circles as much as the section is not in the gallbladder but in the costal cartilages, and this position is suitable for the section.
Because it is lean and the vessels of blood from it are far away, if the surgeon is brave, he should stretch the gallbladder's skin with a needle and then cut the skin until he sees that the vessels of blood are close to the gallbladder, if he sees anything from them.
The surgeon then clears the incision site, which was described earlier, and shows that it is the same as the opening of the bladder that releases what is crushed and the sound that is cut off, leaving the wound open for some time. If the time that was feared in the constriction has passed, the wound's scab will be formed from the skin.
He then drew a line that was not a gash, and then used the drugs that make the meat to remove them, as this author of the book explained that this sentence means "if they see the cat's tooth closed one of these worms that were mentioned.
The cat closed the death and said to itself that it would cut the throat to breathe on the wound's position some breaths and save from death, but they ordered to leave the wound open until the disease is cured and becomes a three-day sura.
So they ordered to dress and treat the wound until it is clean, and I saw this myself when a servant took a needle and sent it to close her wound, cut some air passage with it, and called for its treatment and found the wound open like the open one of the dead, and revealed the wound.
I found the blood that exited the wound to be clear, indicating that no organs or bones had been cut. The wind also exited the wound, so I cleaned and treated it until it was healed, leaving nothing but a slight sound.
After some time, it improved to its best condition, and from here we can say that the incision of the hen's leg has no risk.
The fourth chapter.
In the incision on the tumor that is exposed outside of the thigh and is called the thigh tumor.
This tumor called the thigh tumor is a large tumor on the body's skin and is common in women and is of two types.
Either it is a natural one or an exposed one, and the natural one has no doubt about it, and the exposed one is on two points of either one being similar to the acne and the other being similar to the tumor that is from the thickening of the vein and in its incision there is risk. It is not recommended to expose it with iron wire except what was small of it if she pricked and washed it with the needle and made it look like the acne and it was not related to anything from the veins so she cut it as she cuts the acne. The patient empties the contents of the vial if it is in a vial, and otherwise discards all of it. Then, they treat the affected area with the appropriate treatment.
The fifth chapter and fortieth part.
In the section on types of goods in the store.
The goods are many and I have mentioned all their types in the division, so it is necessary to explain the difference between the product and the waste as it is a problem, so I say that the waste has heat and fever and fear until the cooling of the glow. And the ash remains in this state of heat and cold, and the product does not have heat or fever or pain with it, and it is contained in a small case with its own color and its beginning is like the hammasa and turns into the bahihah and largest to smallest.
And it is of two types, either charred or if it contains moisture, and the colors of moisture are many as mentioned in the division, so it is necessary if you reach the treatment of the goods to dry and wipe it first with the device called the madse on what appears in the next room.
The size of the tumor, then remove the dressing and observe what comes out in its wake, for moisture will come out along with the color it had, breaking it into a simple division as mentioned in other tumors, and if it does not come out in the wake of the dressing, know that it is a gangrenous one.
The division of this moisture is a compact one, as I informed you, binding it with threads and pulling the skin from all sides, preserving it in the box if possible to come out correctly with the medicine.
If the box cannot be opened when working and it did not come out correctly, many times it is better to cut it into pieces until nothing remains of it, for if there is still something left, it may be a small amount or too much medicine has returned.
If the wound is large and there remains some of it, shave around the tumor and treat it with other medicines until it comes out, for if the medicine is large, cut its scar and treat it with what is suitable.
If you encounter a poisonous or non-poisonous bone with bleeding, shave the area with the prepared cuticle and leave it open for one or three days until the wound heals and the blood stops gushing, then return to cut off what remains of the medicine.

In the section of the instruments.
There are three types of scissors: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large scissor.
Image of a medium-sized scissor.
Image of a small scissor.
These are the handles, also known as the bows, which are made of folded iron and are finely cut to facilitate entry into the wounds. They come in three sizes: large, medium, and small, image of a large handle.
Image of a medium-sized handle.
Image of a small handle.
These handles are used to examine wounds, incisions, bones, and abscesses, and to explore what is inside them. They are made from a soft, smooth material similar to ivory, such as Chinese ginseng, gold, silver, or copper, and the best ones are made from Chinese ginseng.
Handles can also be made of lead, and they are used to remove splinters from wounds by pulling them out with the wound. They come in three sizes: long, medium, and small.
As far as it requires, he should make a groove around the entire circumference of the nozzle and its opening, like the image of a large leaden spear.
A middle image of a leaden spear.
A small image of a leaden spear.
The images of the spices are many because there are simple ones with one handle and there are three kinds of large, medium, and small ones, and among them are the Spanish cinnamon, which has three kinds and among them is the Spanish cinnamon with handles, which has three kinds, and among them is the Spanish cinnamon, which is mixed with handles, which has three kinds. And among them is the Spanish cinnamon with three kinds of weights, which are three kinds, and all these are needed in its place, a simple image of a large leaden spear. A middle image of a simple leaden spear. A small image of a simple leaden spear.
A large image of an expensive Spanish cinnamon. A middle image of an expensive Spanish cinnamon.

A large surgical instrument with three-pronged cusps.
An intermediate-sized surgical instrument with three-pronged cusps. A small surgical instrument with three-pronged cusps.
These are images of the instruments used to excise and remove tumors, which come in three sizes: large, intermediate, and small. Here is an image of a large instrument.
An image of an intermediate-sized surgical instrument.
An image of a small surgical instrument.
The edges of the incisions should be limited, while the other sides are not, in order to facilitate removal of the tumor without causing excessive bleeding or damaging surrounding tissue. The patient should find some relief from the pain caused by the excision.
These are images of the retractors, which come in three sizes: large, intermediate, and small. Here is an image of a large retractor.
It is made of a type of steel that is easily bent, with a wide opening on one side resembling a bird's beak hidden inside, which is used to enter and exit the body as desired.
Images of the palmar fascia that lie between the fingers in bone tumors are not felt by the patient and there are three types because some of them are large, others are medium-sized, and others are small. Image of a large palmar fascia:
Images of the ligaments that are cut by bleeding and there are three types because some of them are large, others are medium-sized, and others are small. Image of a large ligament:
These ligaments should be large and small in number to quickly cut the blood when necessary and when no medicine is available.
However, these ligaments should not be used to cut the blood in all parts of the body, but rather in the meaty areas such as the thigh, heel, shoulder, chest, abdomen, and surrounding organs.
And they can be made into smaller instruments that resemble the buttons of a dress on this image:
It cuts the blood when bleeding occurs from a wound or when cutting flesh or thread, and it can be made into an instrument on this image:
The seventh and fourteenth chapter.
In the treatment of male impotence.
Some men's penises become soft and yellowish due to dreaming, until they resemble female genitals. If one dislikes this, it is recommended to cut the penis in this manner.
From point A to point J. Then clean the wound with salted water, then close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals, as the penis from top to bottom is relaxed due to its bone structure.
It is recommended to cut the upper part of the penis with two lines that resemble a crescent moon, and connect each line with the other at their ends until the largest line encircles the smallest on this pattern. From point A to point J, then clean the skin between the lines and remove the sutures, and use what we mentioned of sutures, stitches, and what is needed for treatment until it heals.
If you do not want to cut what is recommended for fear of bleeding or from blood loss, it is recommended to cover the wound with a damp cloth in the warm water and leave it until the remaining sutures are eaten, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Eighteen and Fourth Part.
In the bones that are exposed under the shoulder.
These bones that are exposed under the shoulder are of the hard variety, encased in a case and containing within it moisture. Therefore, it is recommended to make an incision in this shape.
From point ~b~ to point ~j~, if you remove everything from the tumor in that time, cut it with a clean cloth and leave it until the next day, then remove the cloth.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it is removed. If the tumor is of the hard variety, as we mentioned in the incision on the hard bones, either if the wound extends to the end of the rib, use the knife as we mentioned earlier.
Chapter Nineteenth and Fourth Part.
In the incision of the tumor that is exposed before the tendon or nerve and is called aneurysm.
If the tendon is cut and the skin above it is stripped off, this often exposes a tumor and also exposes the nerve to have a spasm and a tumor.
And the signs that one knows that the tumor and spasm are before the tendon or nerve, if the tumor is before the tendon, it is rectangular in shape and extends in the depth of the body, and if you press the tumor with your finger, it feels like it has a partition.
When the tumor is before the clavicle, it appears as a swelling on the body's surface, and the application of iron treatment to these tumors is dangerous, especially in the shoulder and collarbone, and many other parts of the body, it was very large, so it is best to avoid treating it with iron.
And what was also dangerous in the sides or on the head, it is best to avoid it, and if it was a swelling in the intestine, it would open it in the skin, then close it with sutures, and then cut the intestine and end it from the wounds.
Until it bursts, then enter a catheter under it and pull it to the other side and tie the intestine with a thin thread in the two places you know from the knotting of the intestines in the knees, then pull it with a needle in the place between the tendons until all the blood that was in it comes out.
And the tumor is cured, then use the treatment that produces scar tissue until the tendons fall, and then treat it with the appropriate scars until it is released.
If the tumor is before the clavicle, it is best to hold the tumor with your hand as much as possible with the skin, then enter a catheter under the place you held with your hand and pull it through and have a thin thread in it until it comes out of the other side. After securing the tumor with a good tie, as mentioned in tying the grape from both sides to the blade's points, I feared that the threads might slip, so I inserted another needle with another thread under the tumor all at the point where the first needle's point meets.
Then, cut the tumor in its center until nothing remains but cut off the skin flap and leave what is left attached, then place a piece of gauze soaked in oil on top. Then, continue with the treatment that consists of the plaster and poultice until it releases.
The fifth chapter.
In the tumor that shows from nerve swelling.
Similarly, the tumor is also exposed in the muscle and vein, and it also shows in the nerve if a blow or excessive fatigue or similar occurs in it, and this is more common in the areas of tendons and fascia.
And in every position where the joints move, a tumor that is similar in color to the rest of the body appears, and it is usually not painful unless pressed with great force, as if there were inflammation, and the tumor does not form in the depth of the body.
A movement beneath the skin, moving in all directions, not advancing or retreating, what it was in the joints should not be exposed to lead, for it may cause a delay, and what it was in the head or on the side.
If the skin is split along a line, and the tumor is small, it should be removed with scissors from its origin and then cut away if it is large, then remove it and close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
The ninth and fiftieth section.
In cutting the inguinal slits that are exposed in the abdomen.
Many people may have slits in their abdomens and in other parts of their bodies, called the inguinal hernia, which resembles the fistula but is softer and has a prominent head, and it has changed its scar and has small ones and large ones.
I have seen a man with inguinal hernias in his abdomen, which resembled fistulas but were softer and had prominent heads, and they had changed their scars and had split, and moisture always flowed from them, so I cut them and threw one weighing around eighteen ounces and the other around six ounces.
The operation involves cutting the wound, as the affected area is moist and the color of the thyme is white and moist. It should be cut with a wide blade and placed in your mouth for heating in the fire. Often, much blood flows when cutting it.
If your blood flows excessively when cutting the wound, see that the affected area is swollen and frightened from being cut with iron. Take a lead wire of moderate thickness and make it as thin as the thyme that is in this form, and leave it for two days, then increase the thickness of the lead wire, and it will still be thin.
Whenever the thyme is affected until it breaks and falls from its own, if the thyme is originally harsh, then some fear and anxiety should be felt when cutting it, especially in the abdomen, but it may be possible that half of it or some of it can be cut.
Then, do not let it bleed, and treat it until the wound is clean, and be careful not to expose yourself to cuts that are like a thin needle in the eye, as this is a sarcoma and you will remember the sarcoma after this.
Chapter 25, Part 2.
In the treatment of rectal cancer.
The cause of the wound may be many, either due to the division of the abdominal wall which contains the intestines as they exit the body, or blood oozing from the umbilicus or vein leading up to it, or wind that causes irritation.
If the wound occurs before the division of the abdominal wall and the exit of the intestines, the color of the tumor resembles that of the body and is not painful, appearing in different situations. If the wound occurs before the exit of the feces, its position will be more distinct than what we have described so far, if you press on it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns, possibly accompanied by a tingling sensation and swelling when entering the bath and intense fatigue, if it occurs before wetness, it is not painful.
It will not disappear if you press on it with your fingers and will not increase or decrease, if it occurs before blood, the tumor will appear white with this sign, if it occurs after the meat has become soft, the tumor will be firm and fixed on one point.
If it occurs before wind, it is not painful, and the reason for this is that if the wound of the abdomen was before the blood vessel, vein, or wind, it is better to stop treating it because there is fear and anxiety as you know in the chapter mentioned about tumors that occur before the veins and arteries.
When the rectum is before the elbow or the thigh, it is recommended to order the midwife to hold herself and stand firmly extended, then learn around the entire rectum using the midwife's glove. Then order him to lie on his back with his feet towards you, then wrap a wide strip of gauze around the rectum at the position you taught with the glove, then pull the tumor site to the top with a large pincher, and tie the position of the wrap with a strong leather ribbon in a wide band.
The tie of the gauze should be an X, then open the center of the prolapsed tumor above the gauze and insert your middle finger into it and ask the midwife if she found it in the gauze, if yes, pull the X and push the midwife into the abdomen, and if she found a thigh, wrap it with a large pincher.
Cut the ligature, if you meet a thread or string, open it and take two strong ribbons and insert them into the tumor that you made around the rectum, tie them together and make sure they did not cut each other, then pull the tumor in four places on the belt.
If you want to remove the belt and leave the position until the prolapsed tumor recovers and falls by itself or cuts it if it becomes dry, then treat it with what is appropriate from the remedies until it is clean, and if the rectum is full of dry matter in it.
When moisture is present, the tumor should be punctured as we mentioned and the blood or moisture found within should be removed, then treated according to the situation.
The third chapter and fiftieth section.
In the treatment of cancer.
We mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat them with drugs, and the warning against treating them with iron, as it may worsen, and we mentioned the cancer that arises in the abdomen and warned against treating it.
We mentioned at the beginning that when the cancer was in a position that it could be removed as a whole, like the cancer that is in the ovary or in the thigh and similar parts of the functional organs to extract it intact and especially if it is small and initial, but when it has grown large and become big, it should not be approached.
I have not seen anyone who has successfully treated it before, and I have not seen anyone else do it either, and the operation if it is feasible as we mentioned should be advanced to make the removal of the black day easier times and then amputate if it is in the ribs and is full of white.
Then the flap is placed in a position where it can be worked on, and then it is covered with the skin from all sides until nothing of its original roots remains and leave the blood to flow and do not cut it quickly.
Seize the heavy blood all with your hand or with whatever tools you have, and if you encounter a significant bleeding from cutting threads or dissecting organs until the blood stops, then treat it with other treatments until it is cleared.
The Fourth Chapter and the Fifty-First.
In treating the wounds.
We have been informed in the classification of types of hydration and how water is collected and signs of each type and treatment with drugs, and the one that treats with iron is only the zinc type and not with the copper or the lean meat type.
If this is a wound, and you have treated this type of zinc wound with drugs and it did not improve, then look if the weakness or another disease other than the wound is present in it.
Vomiting or diarrhea and similar symptoms, if you treat it with iron, then it is a poison because I saw the patient's strength was not alone without another disease, and he was not a child nor a young man, so the purpose of the treatment is to make the patient stand upright between your hands. A servant behind him cuts his stomach with his hands and pushes the water downwards towards the side of the wound, then a shaky measurer takes this picture.
The incision is long and defined on one side, like the measurer, but there is some fat on the other side to avoid irritating the patient during the abdominal operation. If the fistula arises from the intestines, it is observed if the fistula develops from the abdomen.
It is recommended that the incision be made three fingers below the navel, if the fistula arises from a liver disease, then your incision should be a vaginal incision of three fingers, if it arises from a gallbladder disease, then the incision should be on the left side by three fingers.
It should not be made in the side that the patient wants to lie on, otherwise curiosity may reach that weak position, then close the skin with the instrument all over, then insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
The measurer between the skin and the swab is made as if it is washing it, with a size similar to the toothpaste, then close the swab until the measurer reaches an empty position, which is the position of the water, then remove it and insert the instrument into the handle of the device that this is its image.
A narrow tube made from thin silver, bone, or ivory, with a smooth opening at the bottom and small projections on three sides, as shown.
He may place a side on the side of the pen's handle on this image of it.
The top part of the device has a hole, and if it reaches the water, it descends from its time on the device, and water flows out at a moderate rate because if you let it flow out more than is appropriate in the time, the animal's spirit will die from the loss of life force.
Or it may be near death, but it lets out water according to its strength and what it shows of the animal's life force and color, then the device exits and holds the water, which is because it absorbs from its time.
Due to the skin that holds the pin on the spout, which I told you to cut off at that point, then the device will return another day if I see the animal possible for that.
And it also comes out of the water in a moderate amount, doing this days while you are on your knees and preserving from mistakes so that only a little water remains, if you hid from the animal and left some water, then deal with it by burying it in hot sand.
The excerpt is a description of a surgical procedure involving the removal of excess skin from the bath and sun exposure, treated with purifying drugs until it is removed, and then applied to the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as described in what has been mentioned earlier.
The fifth chapter of the forty-fifth part.
In the treatment of children who are born and the positions of their umbilical cords that are not curved or have a narrow curve, or in positions other than their usual position.
Some children may be born from the womb of their mother and have an uncurved or narrow curve, it is recommended to tie her umbilical cord as soon as they are born.
On a very fine thread on this image:
Then place a thin lead bar in the knot and tie it and hold it for three or four days until the child refuses to urinate, and if you do not use lead, it may be that the urine that flows on the position does not leave it to drip.
And the one whose knot is narrow is treated with lead as we have said for many days until it expands, and those who have a knot in a position other than their usual position and that is because some of them are born and the knot at the end of the womb cannot urinate forward.
Until the surgeon raises his hand above and does not depend on the earth for access to the patient's body, which is a corrupt state, the task is to make the patient lie on his back.
Then, with your left hand, stretch it widely and make the patient's head bend with a pen or a sharp nail, as if you are holding something that is about to be inserted in the middle, and place the needle in the middle on what is supposed to be.
And be careful to avoid bleeding as much as possible, as it is often accompanied by what should be cut to treat the wound until it is clean.
The sixth and fifteenth chapter.
In the case of the wound that is exposed on the cover, the cover, the white, the impure, and the pollution, and the tie.
This wound is often exposed in surgery and is a piece of infected meat that becomes clean, so the clean should be tied with a soft ribbon.
And cut it until it is clean, then cover it with a damp cloth in the Egyptian mosque, and then treat it after that with the Egyptian lime until it is clean. And if the wound is dirty and black in color, it is recommended to use the lime after cutting and cleaning.
When the blood is inside the sheet, it should be removed first, and then treated from outside if necessary.
Because you did not treat them together, the sheet may have torn, and it may also have become yellowish in women and white in the sheet. It is recommended to note down all that has turned yellowish and whether it has become yellowish or has already become yellowish.
Then, apply honey to it after that, with the softened and perfumed carnelian beads and the cloth, and then treat it with other remedies until it is cleaned. If bleeding is observed, use a cork on this image:
Honey is beneficial for both cases, especially bleeding and wounds, if the wound has been eaten and has left its followers at some time, it is recommended to enter the urinary pipe with lead to empty the bladder on him, and as for tying the sheet with the wound.
This tying only happens when the sheet is good and has not been torn, and it may be exposed to the wound or scar. It is recommended to untie it with a thin gauze until the gauze becomes soft and the wound disappears from all sides.
In the process of differentiating between the curettage and the cervix, it is recommended to remove a small piece from both the cervix and the hymen, as the hymen is delicate and will easily tear, then separate the hymen and the cervix with a thin, cold water blade to avoid any further connection.
Then, it is treated with a thin, diluted vinegar until it becomes smooth.
The seventh and fifth chapters.
In the cleaning of infants and the treatment of mistakes they may encounter.
Circumcision is not something that can be separated from other surgeries, except that it was one of our practices with our own will and use in infants, especially, and therefore we must draw the best work from it.
The easiest way to ensure safety, I say that the ancient writings did not mention circumcision in anything because it was not used in their rituals and it is what we acquired from them.
Through experience, I found that the majority of manufacturers and barbers use cleaning with mustard and vinegar, with tweezers and needles, and cutting with razors and knives, and I have tried all of these faces.
Cleaning with soap and cloth is better than with wet rag and thread because the cleaning with soap often damages the skin due to the multiple layers of the skin, especially when the upper layer is cut and the lower layer remains.
It forces one to cut another piece and cause pain and cleaning with oil does not agree with it because it may enter the wound, and as for cleaning with sand, it may damage the skin or the child's skin is short due course.
Many times they do not need cleaning and I have seen this, and as for cleaning with soap and cloth, the experience showed me its advantage because the cloth is suitable for cutting the upper scab like the lower scab.
When you measured the size of the scabs and cut them in one go, and in one time, the edge of the thread became like a wall for the skin of the excision from all sides, there are no mistakes in cutting, and the first thing is to fool the child.
And especially when someone understands that you only tie the thread in excision and call him for another day, then make him happy and comfortable with both hands, as he can do this from his mind, and then stop him between your hands holding the crown.
A patient should not be seated or leaning against a wall or under their feet, and should not place anything on the table. Then, insert your hand into the wound and blow into the skin until it rises to the surface until the head of the wound emerges.
Then, clean what gathered in the wound, then tie the position of the exposed part with a thin thread, and tie a small second suture below it. Then, hold your thumb and the second suture in place, ensuring a good fit, and cut the knot between the two sutures. Then, lift the skin quickly and expose the head of the wound, then let a little blood flow, as it is best and least painful for the wound. Then, dab it with a wet cloth, and apply crushed crystal to it, which is better than what you have tried or ointment from Al-Hawari, as it is also beneficial.
Then, lift the skin quickly and expose the head of the wound, then let a little blood flow, as it is best and least painful for the wound. Then, dab it with a wet cloth, and apply crushed crystal to it, which is better than what you have tried or ointment from Al-Hawari, as it is also beneficial. Then, place the eggs on top of the wound in a crack, and cook them in rose water with good rose powder and let them stay on it until the next day, then treat it with other remedies until it is cured.
This is an image of the incision that is suitable for cleaning:
The incision should be deep and straight, with the edges smooth. If any mistake is made during cleaning, it is recommended to moisten the inner skin or part of it before the wound heals.
The incision should be made at the highest point, and if you cannot hold it with your fingers, use a clamp and cut it. If after three days the area beneath the head of the explant remains inflamed and swollen, leave it to heal the tumor and remove it afterwards.
Cut it according to what suits you, and preserve the head of the explant, as cutting something from the head of the explant does not harm it. Treat it with the remedies we described for the wounds in the chapter on wounds.
If the skin is cut above its measure and reduced to above, it does not cause much harm either. Treat it with what we mentioned until it is cleared.
The eighth and fiftieth chapter.
In the treatment of the urine that is retained in the womb.
The retained urine in the womb is caused by blocking of a part, or a solid, a dry, or a raw, or cooked meat and similar matter. If this is treated with what we mentioned in the chapter on the treatment of the blocked parts, the retained urine will be cleared.
Do not allow the bolus to pass until I see that the cut has not harmed the angle of the throat. It is best if the patient lies on his side with his legs extended and then lies on his back with his abdomen against his back and holds himself firmly as he can.
In such cases, the angle of the throat must be forced back to move the cut towards the back, and if the bolus does not pass and the patient's condition worsens, it is recommended to use an instrument called a tenaculum, which looks like this:
It is made of silver and is thin, slightly curved like a bird's wing, with a curve in its head and a point for attracting the bolus with it. A fine thread is taken and tied to a silver or cloth loop.
The thread is inserted from the bottom of the tenaculum and twists around the silver or cloth loop to prevent it from slipping, then the tenaculum is greased with oil, wax, or egg white and the patient lies on a chair.
The patient's throat is emptied and the hole is filled with water or oil and the tenaculum is inserted into the hole until it reaches the bottom of the hole, then it is turned upwards towards the side of the rib and the tenaculum is pushed inside.
Until the analysis is completed, then push the probes into it until they are close to the seat. The left tends to go downwards and the probes inside them, then push them until they reach the abdomen and feel with the finger that they have reached something empty.
And this is because the vessel through which the urine flows in it swells, then the cord is wrapped around it with a little force, for the urine follows the cord, then it is pulled out and the urine is stopped, and the probes are repeated.
You continue to do this until the abdomen is emptied and the finger finds a void.
The ninth chapter and fiftieth section.
How to wash the abdomen with the trocar.
And the instruments that are used for this are made of silver or of glass with a long tube on a handle, and you should cut in it the water and the drugs, and that is done with an instrument called the trocar and here is its image:
And it is made of silver or of glass with a long tube on a handle that is all covered except for three prongs, two from one side and one from the other as you see:
The excerpt discusses a critical area where the chest muscles are in contact with the ribcage, up to the point where they attract moisture and move when oil is applied, similar to how seaweed moves in sea wars.
If you want to apply moisture during the wedding ceremony, insert the handle of the sponge into the moisture and attract it with the chest muscle towards above, then the moisture will be absorbed into the sponge's core and then inserted into the analysis according to what we have described in the Qathatir, then push the moisture with the handle.
This moisture reaches the wedding ceremony on the spot, and this is a picture of a gentle touch that soothes the wedding:
Make a head from gold or silver with a small crown that resembles the crown and has a band below it where the ring goes, then take the wedding ceremony and put the moisture you want to apply to the wedding in it, then tie it between the two locks with a narrow ribbon.
The moisture is slightly cooled on the fire, then insert the handle of the wetting into the analysis, and raise your hand with the moisture raised evenly until the bride feels that the moisture has reached the wedding.
If you do not have a feast, take a piece of cloth and make a circle from it, then pierce it from all sides. Then insert a thin thread into the pierced circle as it rotates, and gather the cloth circles like the sleeves after placing what you want in them of moisture, vapors, and water.
Then tie it in the device and make it as you made from the feast with your finger tip until the moisture reaches the feast.
The seventh part.
In removing the piece.
We mentioned in the division the types of wounds and their treatment with drugs, and mentioned the difference between wounds originating from the kidneys and those originating from the uterus, and signs of all of them, and mentioned the wounds where the work is done with the hand and the finger.
This is the wound originating from the uterus, especially, and which starts in the dissection, and I describe it as a brief explanation and summary.
I say that the wound originating from the uterus is more exposed to children, and among its signs is that the urine comes out of the uterus similar to water in its stream.
And it shows the dung and it is mentioned and it is played with, and it spreads a lot, and many of them are affected by it, and it becomes easy for children to reach fourteen years old, and it is difficult in the elderly, and as for the young men, it is in the middle between these two.
The largest pieces are the easiest to treat, and the smaller ones should be treated first. If we proceed with treatment, it is recommended that the affected area be inoculated with an inoculation that will remove all pus present. This may prevent the appearance of the lesion during inspection.
Then, the affected area is wrapped around the leg and rolled down to the ankle or from a higher position several times, then it is placed between your hands with one hand on top of his hand under his wrist so that the entire wound leans towards the bottom and is inspected.
If you feel the wound in the space, start cleaning it as soon as possible if it is not under your finger tip, then clean the little finger of the left hand with ointment if the lesion is a child or the middle finger.
If it is a child's wound, enter it into his seat and inspect the wound until it falls under your finger tip as little as possible, then gently pull it with your finger and push it out towards the place you want to clean.
You order the attendant to cut the wound with his hand and order another attendant to spread his left hand above the women's skin towards the position where the wound is to be cleaned, then the examiner takes the smear as it appears in this picture:
In the excerpt, Albucasis describes a surgical procedure involving the removal of a solid mass from between the legs and towards the left side of the pelvic bone. The operation should be performed on the same area, with the index finger placed in the socket and the thumb applied externally to create a wide exit for the solid mass while keeping the entrance narrow. The extent of the removal will depend on how much of the solid mass can be extracted from the socket.
In this excerpt, Albucasis emphasizes that the pressure applied to the finger in the socket should not be excessive, as it may cause difficulty in removing the solid mass. He also warns that the solid mass may have curves or irregularities that could make its removal more challenging.
In this excerpt, Albucasis explains that the solid mass may have curves or irregularities that could make its removal more challenging. He suggests that if the solid mass does not easily come out, it may be necessary to cut it into smaller pieces using a precise cut with a sharp blade, similar to the edge of a knife. This would help to reduce the difficulty in removing the solid mass.
In this excerpt, Albucasis advises that the solid mass should be carefully held in place and, if possible, a gentle instrument with a firm edge should be inserted under it. If this is not feasible, the exit should be slightly enlarged, and if blood is found, it should be cut with a sharp blade. This would help to ensure that the solid mass is removed safely and efficiently.
In case more than one large pill is swallowed and then the small one, and then the large one is also swallowed afterwards, and this is repeated with more than two pills, if the large one is extremely large, then it is necessary to cut it into a large piece because it exposes one of the two dangers.
Either it dies or it causes permanent dilation of the bowel to prevent it from touching the operative site, but try to push it until it comes out or breaks in a crush with the collodion until it comes out as a piece.
If you are relieved from your work, clean the wound with soap and water, dry it with a cloth or with alcohol and cold water to keep the tumor warm, and then allow the inflammation to subside until the third day without closing the furrow.
If the position is washed with a lot of water and oil, then treat it with the mallow root and the basil root until it is cleared, and if there is an excessively hot tumor that is eating away at the wound and causing it to swell like the cold of the stomach preventing the passage of the bowel and knowing this from the exit of blood with the feces.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove the blood, for if it remains, it will cause the bone to decay and rot. Then cleanse the wound with water, salt, and vinegar, and apply each type of remedy according to its shape until it is cleansed.
During the entire treatment, it is recommended to tie the thighs and gather them to confirm the drugs placed on the site, for if the tumor is small and entered the abdomen and became there and stopped the excretion of urine, it should be treated as described before it becomes a tumor.
Often, this treatment has replaced the tumor, as I have tried it and it is that image: take a stimulant from iron from Florence.
Cover the sharp angle of the abdomen with a bandage, then take a thread and tie it around the tumor under the bandage so that it does not return to the bone, and then insert an iron stimulant into the analysis until it reaches the same site as the tumor.
Hold the stimulant with your hand in the same site as the tumor a little, and you will turn the point of the bone until it exits from the other side, for the urine will flow out of its time, then close your hand on what remains of the tumor outside the abdomen, for it will tear and exit with the urine and cleanse the wound.
If this treatment does not alleviate the obstruction in your throat, tie a cord under the gauze and another one above it, then pull it through the gauze in the same loop between the two ties, then remove it.
Then clean the wound and let the cold, dead blood that entered the wound drain out, but if you do not tie the cord under the gauze, it may return to the incision and the other cord above, so that even after the gauze is removed, the skin will return to its original position covering the wound.
Therefore, it is recommended that if you tie the cord above, you lift the skin up to cover the wound when you remove it and it will return to its original position covering the wound as we said.
The ninth and tenth sections.
In the removal of the gauze from women.
A little of the gauze is produced in women, and if one of them shows a gauze, it makes treatment difficult and many faces turn away because the woman may be shy and the second because there is no woman who exposes herself to the doctor.
If it is a small piece or from those who are veiled and the fourth, you will not find a woman who can improve this industry, especially handwork, and the fifth, that the position of pulling the cord on the gauze of women is distant from the position of the gauze, so you need a loose cord.
In that case, it is risky and necessary to invite a good female physician who is rarely found. If she does not exist, ask for a light-hearted, friendly male physician or prepare a good female physician in the matter of women or a woman who refers to this craft some indication.
Prepare her and order her to make everything she commands of the inspection of the incision first, as she looks if the woman is pregnant, it is recommended that she enters her finger into her seat and inspects the incision if she found it and press it with her finger.
And when she orders her to cut it, if she is not pregnant and has a tight belly, order the good one to enter her finger into the pubic bone and inspect the incision after putting her left hand on the mound and pressing it well.
And if she found it, it is recommended that she descend from the pubic bone to its end until she reaches the knee of the thigh then inspect it on either side of the pubic bone at the knee of the thigh from whichever side she approaches the incision and feels the abdomen in that area.
And her finger should not leave the incision pressing it, and then make a small cut on that small cut and if you feel the incision increase according to what you know that the incision comes out of it, know that there are many types of incisions.
From small to large, male and female, mastectomy, amputation, castration, and shaving. Know their types to support your conclusion, as your blood will be in the clean, disinfected area and you should hold it for an hour until the blood stops, then return to your work.
Until the excision is complete, and you should be familiar with the instruments mentioned in removing the gauze from men for your use, as your blood will be lost and you will know the pulse of the blood that it is from the cutting of the veins on the site.
Sharpen the blade sharply and leave it, do not take it back, leave the excision and if the wound heals after a few days and the area is clean, return to your work until the excision is complete.
The second part and sixth section.
On the left side of the wet vagina.
The wet vagina is only moisture in the white layer under the peritoneum surrounding the egg and it is called the serous membrane, which may be in a special cloth provided by nature on one side of the egg.
Until he thinks that it is another egg and there is between the peritoneum and the white layer we mentioned, and this tissue does not exist except in the labia, and this tissue is produced from the weakness that women expose to them and may be due to a blow on women.
This moisture has many colors, either it is white or red like blood or black like charcoal or white like eggshells, and the signs that are known for it.
Where the water is, if it is in the white vagina that we mentioned earlier, the tumor becomes less long and more like an egg shape and does not show any symptoms because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in a white cloak, then the tumor becomes less long from one side of the egg.
And the man thinks that it is another egg, and if the moisture is between the skin of the clitoris and the white vagina then it is under the skin, and if you want to know the color of the moisture, cut the tumor with a square-edged knife and what comes out after cutting is what determines its contents inside.
If we go to treatment with iron, it is recommended that you order the patient to fast if possible and observe his body full of then he lies on his back on something high but little and places many cuts under him and you sit on his left side.
A servant is ordered to sit to the side of his master and extend his right hand towards one of the sides of the abdomen, near the navel. Then, a wide-bladed knife is taken and the abdominal skin is cut from the middle towards the nearby wound.
The cut should be made perpendicular to the line that divides the abdominal skin into halves until it reaches the white, hollow container of the bladder. It should be closed and preserved so as not to cut it again, more from the side that connects to the bladder, and the cut should be sutured as much as possible.
Then, the bladder is filled with a wide amount of warm water and all the water is expelled. Then, the cut is divided between the incisions of the cut and the bladder is raised to the top without touching the abdominal skin that contains it, and the bladder is cut as much as possible, either by the whole or by separate pieces.
Indeed, the thin side should not be cut if you do not suture the cuts, as the egg may not return inside its shell while you work. If you stop cutting the bladder, close it first, then gather the edges of the abdominal skin with a needle and thread.
After treating all surgeries, if the egg has been damaged by another disease, it is better to tie the vessels in the bag that fears bleeding, then cut the twine from the bag and let the egg out, then treat it as we have mentioned.
If the water in both sides is equal, know that it has determined the other side according to what you did in the first one, whether or not if it balances, do the work alone, then clean the blood.
And enter the plugs with soap that has been greased or in the oil of the rose, and from the outside of another soap that has been greased in alcohol and water, spread it on both sides of the gutta and the abdomen, and place a cross above the cut that is wide, which is the rafters. And tie it from above with the tie that has six points on this figure:
Then take the cuts and wrap them around this example, and make the sides that it has with cloth or wet soap, and gather together in the belt of the sleeves and one side takes on the chair to the back.
And the second takes to the pillow and the sides on the bottom of the legs and the remaining two sides on the abdomen, and gather them all together in the belt of the sleeves, and this dress can also be made by replacing the plug with copper.
A surgeon should take a smooth, thin blade and use it to cut the skin of the patient, starting from where we described until the white container for water bursts. Then, take another blade on this image:.
It resembles the Greek eye, then cut that container with it until all the moisture comes out, then fill the container with sand and wet it with the layered cloth and cut it according to what you can until all of it is removed and preserved from the egg not to burn it.
Know that this operation is safer and better than bleeding, for if you meet with a stop in the cut or at the time of the nail, or if you have a cold or blood or something else, it is recommended to treat everything you encounter with the appropriate treatment according to what has been provided.
If the patient is stubborn and did not endure this operation for his own sake, let him use the lamb according to what I have described and if it is correct with what we have provided from the evidence.
It is wet, so it is recommended that the patient sits on a high stool, then cut the tumor at its bottom with a wide blade and let the lamb be on the body's length and make the incision wide enough for all the water to flow, then place the cloth on the position and tie it.
After washing the wound with water, treat it until the wound is clean, because the white membrane obstructs the mouth of the wound and prevents the water from exiting.
Then, it is recommended to insert a sponge or the device that draws water from the perfumes that were presented or slightly widen the wound opening.
And know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so, and if it accumulates, wash the same place and cleanse it with the purifying remedy for a few days.
The third section is the thirtieth.
On the side of the liver and treating it.
Know that the side of this liver from the poison that leads to death in more cases, so we see it and its safety from it, and I remember the work in it and its types of tumors.
I say that tumors have occurred in many bodies, and that is due to the composition of women and it is due to either a frivolous growth that leads to women or due to a strike, and the color of the tumor is on the color of the body and there is no water in it.
The tumor is pulsating and may have been a hematoma with no color or sensation, possibly caused by the constriction and narrowing of the vessels, as they might have advanced or from the constriction of the tendons. The constriction of the vessels is known as the spread of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not expose the tendon, and as for what is caused by the constriction of the tendons, nothing spreads out when pressed with fingers, and this type may cause it to shrivel up on itself and on other parts of the leg.
And it is that the skin of the thigh is stretched, then the egg is pushed upwards and comes out of the white bag, releases the constriction from the blood vessels, connects the blood vessels, and cuts the constriction after it has released it from all sides of the egg's surface, if the egg had been covered by those shrivelled leg muscles.
It is preferred that the egg be extracted and cut, and if there is a constriction between something in the bags or between the blood vessels, it is preferred that all of that constriction be released and cut in a suitable manner.
If the meat is in a position of constriction that is behind, it is preferred that all of it be cut and the egg be extracted as we have said, if your operation is successful, clean the wound with gauze dipped in oil and alcohol, then treat it with other treatment until it is released.
Chapter Fourteen and Seventeen.
In the treatment of abscesses with furuncle.
The furuncle is a boil with some whitening similar to a ring, causing discomfort in women, difficulties in movement and sports and walking, and in the treatment of this type of strain from the groin close to what he mentioned.
But it is better to remember the operation on what was done by the first, and I say that it is better to sit the strain on a raised chair, then to push the woman's breast downwards, then to hold the skin of the nipple with your fingers with the nearby veins of the neck.
And the attendant holds her tight and stretches it widely, then cuts it with a wide blade that is sharp and smooth with a shoe of the veins until the veins ooze, then it swells from all sides as you mentioned in the strings of the knots in the groin, then the forceps is inserted into it with a fine thread.
And tie it in the first position that the furuncle revealed to her, and also tie it in the last one, then cut it in the middle with a cut that is based on the length of the body and what comes out of it are the decayed acrid exudations.
After treating the gauze with the other surgical operations you want to give time for the veins that nourish one of the women to fall, there is no problem with that, as long as the incision exposes all the veins, it is recommended that one of the women leaves with the veins so as not to spoil the egg food. Before cutting the veins, it will swell and will not benefit from it.
The fifth and sixth section.
In the treatment of the male masturbation.
This masturbation occurs from a gap that extends on the abdomen in a manner resembling the navel of the belly, and the semen is injected from that incision to one of the women.
And this incision can be either from the abdomen or its extension, and this type of causes has many reasons such as hitting, congestion, sneezing, or lifting something heavy, and its sign if it is from the extension of the abdomen is that it happens a little bit slowly in a long time.
And it does not happen suddenly and the tumor is at depth from before the abdomen cuts off the semen, and its sign if it is from the abdomen incision is that it happens first with a great pain and the tumor is different, visible under the skin near.
The patient is discharged from the hospital and its destination is outside the sickroom, and it may be discharged with the pessary, and these ducts are called pessarii and throbbi, and they can be affected by wind, and in the pessary of Zablus, death may occur here.
Because it is a difficult pain and twitching, especially when it advances, and the treatment of these types of diseases with iron is risky, so it is advisable to warn against falling in it, and the description of the work is to command the patient to put the pessary in his hand inside his chest if he comes to reverse.
Then he lies on his side with his knees on your lap and raises his legs, then the skin that follows the pessary is rolled upwards and all of the skin of the thigh is rolled over it until the opening of the thigh is opened with these rolls.
The opening of the thigh is on the extent that the egg can be expelled from it, then the sheets under the skin of the thigh are wiped until the white hard shell breaks from both sides when this happens, then insert your little finger into the egg below.
Between the white sheet under the egg and the second sheet, with the adhesive that comes from behind the egg, then press with your left hand inside the skin of the thigh and at the same time roll up the white sheet with your right hand and lift the egg with the sheet to the side of the opening.
The servant is ordered to beat the egg to the top and then firmly press the nail that was shot from behind with full force, using your thumb to ensure there's nothing sticky in the white rigid bag. If you find something, remove it from the bag and push it into the belly below.
Then, take a needle with a thick thread that has been pulled from ten threads and insert it at the last part of the bag beneath the skin of the rabbit that follows the hip. Then, cut the ends of the thread until there are four threads. Then, tie some of them together in a tight way and tie the bag that we mentioned is beneath the skin of the rabbit with a very strong ribbon from both sides. Then, also tie the ends of the threads so that nothing from the fluids that it feeds can reach it. So that it doesn't show a hot grip and also appears as a second ribbon outside the first ribbon, more than two fingers apart, and then from this bag, take the one that is beneath the skin of the rabbit according to the size of the finger.
So that it doesn't show a hot grip and also appears as a second ribbon outside the first ribbon, more than two fingers apart, and then from this bag, take the one that is beneath the skin of the rabbit according to the size of the finger. And cut the rest according to the pattern and remove the egg with it, then make a wound below the skin that drains the blood and time as we described earlier, then use the painted cloth in oil and place it in the wound and use the ribbon that we described.
The white gauze that we mentioned after cutting it with caution to avoid bleeding, often exposes this, and leaves the tendon until it falls by itself, as soon as it falls, it is dipped in hot water and carries on it what it sheds until it falls.
Then, treat the wound with other surgical remedies until it heals.
The sixth and seventh chapters.
In this case, this cautery is not something I have ever seen treated with copper, although I mentioned that it should be made as we described in the wound, with a hole and that the vessels should be tied below after cutting them.
Then, cut in the middle and treat the tumor with what opens it until the vessels fall and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
The seventh and eighth chapters.
In the incision that is in the thigh.
The incision in the thigh may be placed as we mentioned in the case of Nenuto, and it does not descend to the women, and if it descends, it is slow and returns in all times.
However, if time passes, the cut in the gauze will become more extensive until the mucous membrane and the flesh of the thigh are exposed due to the extension of the gauze that is in the thigh as we mentioned. The surgical instrument is extended and then relaxed, and the position is adjusted, and the wound is closed as previously described and presented.
The wound may be closed with a needle on this page. First, bend the tip of the needle between your fingers, then cut the warm, clean wound in an upward direction on the palm of your hand, and stitch the incisions that are under the skin.
Until the white wound that follows it bursts, take a sponge and place it on the inside of the wound, then wrap it around the abdomen, and then cut the two sides of the wound on the side of the sponge with the needle and stitch them together.
Then, smooth the sponge and do not cut the white wound or break the egg or anything else as I informed you in treating the surgical wounds, and then treat it with surgical treatment.
If the threads break, cut them and smooth the wound until it heals, and the wound will not increase in size and the opening of the incision will not be large.
And the best thing in this case is because it is closest to safety.
The eighth and seventh chapters.
In the relaxation of the skin of the thigh.
Many people's skin itches due to the meat inside it, and its appearance changes. Therefore, if someone wishes to treat it, they should apply a poultice on its surface.
Then, all the itchy skin cuts on the thick skin come together, and if you want to scrape them first, use three gauzes or four and then cut between the gauzes.
Then, treat it with other surgical treatments to remove the threads and they will fall off.
The ninth section and seventh part.
In the excerpt.
The excerpt is forbidden in our law.
Therefore, I did not mention it in my book because it is forbidden in our law, but I mentioned it for the sake of knowledge of the physician if asked about it and to show the treatment for itching, and the other face that we often need some animal sacrifice for our benefits.
And I say that the sacrifice is made by two methods, either by cutting or by tearing, and the method by cutting is that we put the animal in hot water until the female part of it becomes relaxed, smooth, and wrinkled.
He should be held by your hand until he sweats and does not show any signs upon being touched. As for the castration and incision, it is advisable to hold the animal and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the strings and cut on each egg one single slice.
Until the eggs are white, cut them after you have swollen them and do not leave any of the thin membranes on them except the fine one that is on the vessels, this beating from castration is better than what is done by cutting.
Because the cutting may remain on the female, the animal was gathered, then the wound was treated until it was clean.
The seventh book.
In the treatment of the boil.
The boil can be in men on two types, one of which is that it appears in the space or in the skin of the vagina in women, shaped like a woman's private part with hair and may discharge from the one that is in the skin of the vagina.
And in women, there is one type that appears above the breast on the pregnant woman, similar to small testicles, pointing outwards from one of them like a man's penis, and the treatment for the three types.
The excerpt discusses two types of men and one type of woman, who should have excessive fat removed until it is no longer felt, and then treated with other surgical procedures until it is completely removed. The second type of man who has bloody discharge from the navel does not have any function or purpose in this context.
This is the title of the 30th and 70th chapters of the textbook on surgery by Albucasis.
The excerpt discusses the cutting of pubic hair and excess fat from the women's bodies.
The excerpt discusses the possibility of increasing pubic hair in women until it becomes unsightly and may even spread like that of men, leading to a disorganized appearance.
The excerpt advises that it is preferable to hold onto the pubic hair with your hand or a scalpel and cut it without being concerned about the depth of the cut, as this will prevent bleeding from the source.
The excerpt states that the excess fat should be treated with surgical procedures until it is completely removed, and the unripe fat is fat that grows in the mouth of the camel until it fills it.
The excerpt suggests that the excess fat may have gone outside, for example, like sin. The excerpt states that some early physicians called this disease "the sinful disease," and it is preferable to cut it off like pubic hair and treat it until it is completely removed.
The second and seventh chapters.
In the treatment of ascites.
Ascites occurs when the female's abdomen is not reinforced, or when the reinforcement is small, and it can be either congenital or acquired. The acquired type results from an excess of fatty tissue.
It can be a thin or thick pad, and it can be located in the abdomen, on the sides, at the top or bottom, preventing the embrace, the girdle, childbirth, and possibly the thickening of the belly. The knowledge of this is obtained by looking.
If the plug is visible, it is not necessary to dig for it with your fingers or with a hook. If the plug is a thin pad near the nipples, you should break it by making the nipples resemble thorns, and then insert both hooks from your hands into the nipples.
The woman lies on her side, and the breasts are exposed, then the nipples are stretched until the thin pad is broken, and the plug opens, then she takes a spoon, drinks it in oil, places it on the spot, and the woman does this every day to prevent the spot from being harmed again.
If the fistula is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel resembling paper, and if it is from meat that has putrefied, it should be tied with silk threads, cut open, and surgery should be accompanied by drugs such as onions, garlic, and lard, which are grouped together.
Then use a wide iron tube to prevent the wound from becoming infected quickly, keep it for days and use some powdered uncooked ash, then treat with other remedies for hemorrhoids until it is clean, and there may be another piece of meat growing in this wound.
However, if the cancerous tumor in the wound is not there, the cancerous tumor in the wound does not expose to the iron nail.
The third section and seventh.
In the treatment of boils, carbuncles, and red blotches that expose in women's private parts.
But boils are swelling of the corners of the mouth until a lot of blood flows from it, and if it becomes a carbuncle, it is a boil. It has been mentioned in the classification that its types and signs are noted here.
What is acceptable for treatment and what is not, I say that intestines and gallbladder are not treated if they are deep in the chest and have not shown symptoms. There is no treatment with iron in them, and whatever was in the chest does not fall on them, it is the one that treats.
It is preferred that a woman enters a cold house and then pours gallbladder with a cloth or a fine knife and cuts it from its roots, then leaves it on the blood that comes from one of the non-cutting uterine arteries.
Like the saffron and cinnamon and ginger and similar things, then raise your legs to the wall for an hour, then dip them in cold water if the bleeding persists, then sit on the baking of the caraway and the necks of the rhamn and the aloe and similar things, then take flour and grind it with honey and spices.
And put it on her back if the bleeding stops, or else the firm bandage and the ovaries are required, then take alum and grind it with the ginger sauce or the ginger of pregnancy or the sauce of the agal of the al-laliq and mix it with the drink of aloe and place it in the right position.
If the tumor is empty, treat the area with mercury until it is clean, and as for the blood-red substance, it resembles the rough ends of a hazelnut, it is recommended to cut what is visible of it according to what was mentioned in the Thalliel, regardless and treat it until it is clean.
The fourth chapter and seventh section.
In the lower eyelid that is exposed in the cheek.
Various types of tumors such as cancer, hard tumor, warts, callosities, ulcers, ganglions, cysts, and abscesses are found in the lower eyelid, and all of these diseases and their types and symptoms have been mentioned in the classification.
It is recommended to mention the hard tumor that is found in the lower eyelid if it is a tumor that accumulates in its corner, as it may look like this in the iron treatment, so you should look at it, as it may have a severe pain at the beginning with swelling and fever.
I saw it was red and if it was affected by the cold, treat it with iron until the symptoms disappear, then the woman should sit on a chair with her feet resting on her chest.
The woman's thighs come together below the abdomen and her feet are exposed from both sides, and her arms are under her hips and they are tied together with a band that adjusts.
Then the woman sits from the right side and uses the device that opens her womb, and it is recommended to use this device if you want to use it, that the depth of the husband's womb should not be more than the depth of the womb.
The woman should be careful if the device is deeper than the depth of the womb, and it is recommended to place the teeth on the neck of the womb to prevent the entire device from entering the womb all at once, and it is recommended that the tooth that is done in the device comes from the upper side.
And you hold the device and the attendant does the tooth until it opens the neck of the womb, if the foreskin appears and is touched with your hand and it is soft, it is recommended to cut it at the head with a wide blade if the entire time has passed.
It is recommended that a gauze with a soft foreskin is wrapped in rose oil or green oil with some cut and the gauze is placed outside the incision in the neck of the womb and it appears outside on the neck and on the abdomen, a soft swab is dipped in cold water that has been mixed with soap.
After two days, treat with the ointment that is suitable for that purpose until it clears up.
The wound and the cut may be cleaned with water and sugar, then with water that has become turbid with soda or long zarund, and then return to the ointment. If the discharge is receding internally in the wound, it is to be applied within.
It is best to stop treating with mercury and instead use what we have mentioned in the division.
The fifth and seventh chapters.
In teaching the dressings, how to treat the living organs if they are not in their natural form.
It is best for the dresser to know first the natural delivery shape and its signs, if the woman moves towards the lower part of her body and clenches her teeth and sweats on it, what is on it of the nard.
And the birth of the child is faster, know that this delivery is in its natural form and the exit of the child is at the top of his head and the movement or fixation of it, if you see these signs, it is best to stop the belly of her to make the child be born quickly.
And if it comes out at the top of his head, the movement or fixation of it, if she cleans herself well from that excitement, nothing wrong happened in this delivery, as it is not natural and unnatural because the child may come out of his hands and his hands before his head and feet.
A single hand or foot, or the head with one hand, or the back with one foot, and perhaps falling on a chair, and in this manner from the various forms of danger, it is recommended that the woman be careful with all these things and warn against carelessness and mistakes.
And I am sure of each form of it and how to prove it by that and stand on it, if the child is born from the head of the woman naturally and increases her strength, making her difficult to give birth, and I see her strength has weakened, then I sit her on a chair and order women to hold her.
And wrap her belly with the cooked laurbah and the wet dates, then the woman enters between her fingers with a small stick to squeeze the mash or squeeze it with her thumb until all the moisture is exhausted and the stomach of the woman dries until the child is born.
If the child does not come out, it is recommended that the woman be injected with laurbah ointment with sesame oil, then order her to sweat and moisten her lips and nose after the injection, and if the child comes out early, it is recommended that they gently wipe his hands and feet a little.
When the woman does not enter, place her on the platform and raise her raised legs. Then, tap the platform on the ground and the woman grips to prevent falling off the platform. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut off the hands and attract the remaining fetus.
Or, tie her hands with a knot and attract them with equal force if the fetus comes out. If the fetus comes out through her legs, it is preferable to push her hands upwards, then slightly turn the fetus until it is straightened, and then take one of her legs and make a slight movement.
If the fetus comes out through the clitoris, order her to vibrate and cool the clitoris with a candle until it comes out. If it does not come out as described or if the fetus is slightly deformed until it becomes natural, then it comes out smoothly when she stops what was described.
Take from the husk of the wheat and the husk of the barley, anoint the shave, moisten it with a soluble substance, and beat all on the board with a good blow, then lay the woman's private parts in front of her belly and sit her in warm water until the shaving is complete.
If I think he is lying down, make a pillow from cloth and place it under him. If you hold the pillow for an hour, sit him on the chair, then wipe his mouth and nose, and dry his throat and lower abdomen gently. For the fetus to be born, he should lie down for a short time.
If he is born, let him lie on his side for a short time, then the woman should lie on her stomach with her legs apart and her hands on the bed, and keep her fingers on his abdomen for a short time. Then remove the cloth from between her legs until it is flat below, if the fetus has not been born, take both of her legs and move them in a strong motion, then wipe above the pubis until the fetus goes up, then she enters her hand and aligns the fetus slightly.
And the woman is ordered to give birth, the fetus comes out with one hand extended, she should hold her hand in his, if she cannot hold it, make the woman lie down and make her walk, if she cannot walk, she can lie on her side.
The patient's bed was moved and her legs were strongly rubbed, then the fibers were taken out, laid on a chair, and the hand was massaged to straighten the fetus in its natural form, and the woman was advised to walk until the fetus is delivered.
When the fetus is delivered, it should be taken out of the mother's womb with the help of her hands, and its face should be turned towards the mother's face. It is recommended that the willing woman hold the fetus' hand, then gently turn and straighten it, and if it stands up, she should carry it on her chest, as we have described in relation to the grease and fibers.
Then, she should gently move a little, if she does that, lay her on the chair and advise her to lean towards the right side, then she should walk until she is exhausted and massage the fetus with oil, as it will be delivered tied to the side.
If the fetus is delivered through the mouth of the mother while she is walking, the walking should be stopped until the moisture is dried, and if she ties a bandage around the fetus' face and neck, it should be cut from the abdomen to prevent it from dying, then the fetus should be placed inside until it is in its proper position.
The woman is ordered to give birth multiple times because it is easy. The twins or many offspring are delivered, know that the twins often reproduce and can have three or four, but they do not survive unless in a high altitude. The five is something outside of nature that does not survive.
Surround them and know that if they multiply, they will separate into one group with a barrier between them, attached in a sac for each one. They may exit as the single fetus exits naturally and easily, and they may exit with a difficult exit as we described.
If some of them are difficult to give birth to, it becomes what we mentioned of non-natural forms, and treat it as we described, so that it is suitable for a gentle approach and does what it does with the help and adapts to all shapes according to what helps it to safety.
Mention what is imagined in the womb of the fetuses to fall, it may be imagined in one and two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten, and I have heard that a woman gave birth to seven and others to fifteen, all of them were imagined as that.
It is the great and wise physician who should strive to master this art, for it must be applied as appropriate as in that day when it will meet its match.
The sixth chapter, seventh verse.
In the delivery of a stillborn fetus.
If the stillborn fetus was treated as mentioned in the classification of treatment, it did not come out and you were forced to perform manual extraction. It is advisable that you look at the woman's strength and see if she has any symptoms that cause her fear of damage. If the woman is strong and there are no signs of disease that she fears, it is advisable that she lies on her side with her face up.
And her head should be tilted downwards and her legs raised, with a pillow or sheet tied to the bed to prevent the body from falling when the fetus moves.
Then, moisten the mouth of the deceased with wet ointments such as almond oil, sweet almond, and rose oil. Then, apply these ointments to the patient's mouth. Then, insert her finger into the mouth in a direction that allows the cords of the fetus to be compressed.
Look, if the fetus is coming out of its head, the cords will be compressed in its eyes, nose, mouth, neck, or chest, or under the thighs and groin, or under the shoulder blades.
When the patient's leg is raised, it should be supported on the left hand and the right thumb should be inserted into the mouth of the forceps, which is held by the left hand, and the forceps should be used to grasp some of the areas we mentioned.
Until something is empty, then the forceps or another one should be used to grasp it on the other side, making sure the traction is even and does not lean towards a particular direction. Then the incision should be made evenly, not just on the plane but also moving in all directions.
This will make the exit easier, similar to how a saw is used when cutting wood. It is recommended that some fingers be greased so that the forceps can easily pass through the opening and move the placenta to another position if some of it has been expelled.
She should do this gently until all of the baby is expelled, as if one hand had gone before the other and could not be returned for pressure. In that case, a cut should be made on it and it should be pulled out until all of the baby has been delivered.
Either in the knee joint or in the groin, it is recommended that the same action be performed on the other hand and both legs, as if the head of the baby is large and has pressure to exit, or if there is water in its head. In that case, a shaking motion should be made between the fingers.
The head is shaved and the water is extracted or it is dried using the instrument known as the suction device, whose image appears alongside the images of other instruments in the following chamber.
Similarly, if the fetus has a large head, it is preferable to shave the scalp or dry it using suction, as we have mentioned, and then remove the bones with the forceps. If the head is exposed and becomes wet during extension, continue shaving until the moisture in the chest dries.
Then the chest is added, and if the chest does not add and there is no exit for the head, cut off what you can, whether it is below the abdomen or has a hole in it, and it is preferable to tie it until the moisture comes out of it.
If the fetus is on its sides, it is easy to draw and straighten its legs to the mouth of the mother, and if it is pressed against the abdomen or chest, it is preferable to draw it with a break, perhaps tearing off the abdomen or chest until what is in them comes out.
If all the limbs are removed and the head is raised, enter with your right hand if the mouth of the mother is open, insert your hand into the neck of the mother and draw the head with your fingers to the mouth of the mother, then enter a cotton or two cottons and draw it with them.
When the mouth of the patient is hot and exposed, it is not appropriate to hurt it, but rather it is recommended to use moist, putrid things and to apply ammonia and sit in the running water.
And if the fetus is on one side, it may be possible to straighten it by using what we mentioned for the living fetus, but if that is not possible, it should be cut into pieces and removed, and it is recommended that nothing of the membrane be left inside the womb, if you have stopped treating yourself, use what we mentioned for treatment in hot wounds that are exposed in the abdomens.
If the flow of blood from the womb is downward and into cold water, and I have seen a woman who gave birth to a stillborn fetus in her belly and then wrapped it again.
Then the other fetus also died, and she was wrapped after a long time and placed in her womb and expanded until it opened and made the umbilicus wide, I treated it after a long time but the wound did not heal, I put some of the strong attractants on it.
He got out of the position and took an bone, then passed some days and another bone came out, I was surprised because the belly does not have bones in it, I estimated that it is from the bones of the stillborn fetus and I searched the wound and took out many bones from the bones of the head of the fetus.
I followed this method until I extracted many bones from her and the woman was in the best of health. Indeed, it was a long time ago, a period of walking on the road that was not usually taken, and yet I bring this here as a rare occurrence.
Because there is knowledge and aid for what the surgeon tries to do with his hand in treatment.
The seventh and seventh section.
In it are images of the instruments needed for extracting the fetus.
A picture of a saw that opens in the mouth of the child:
This rule that balances the books, either with a lamb in both sides of the paws, except that this lamb should be more beautiful than the punch and should be made of bone or wooden sticks, and the width of each stick should be measured with two fingers.
And they are cut at the tip of a finger, with a length of half a finger and in the middle of the paws, two pieces of the same wood have been made more firm by them, and their length should be half a finger or less, and their width should be about two fingers or less. And these two pieces.
These are the two that enter into the mouth of the lamb to open it with your sawing, another image of a tool that is more beautiful and smaller than this.
Make a spoon from willow or willow wood in the shape of a calliper, except that it has two edges like you see, with each edge as long as a thumb and with two fingers as the width, and if you want to open it with this spoon.
Make the woman sit on a bedsheet with her legs spread wide apart, then insert these two edges into the mouth of the knife and hold the device under her hands between her fingers, then open your hand with the tool as you would with a calliper, however much you want to open the knife. Until you make what you want, see picture of another example mentioned at the beginning:
Picture of the gun that pushes the fetus:
Picture of the suture that is sewn around the head of the fetus:
It resembles the tooth on one side as you see, and it can be made into a straight line like a calliper in this picture, as if it has teeth like the teeth of the carpenter, cut it and close it.
Picture of the gun also:
Picture of the suture:
This suture has a small gap in it so it does not break when the fetus is pulled by it, picture of the suture with the hinges:
Wide-bladed fetal cutting images.
These tools were all made faster and better as the variety of their types increased, and they were made available to the craftsman according to his speed, and not to be considered as a tool that you should have made for yourself because there is no need for it.
The 8th and 70th chapter.
In the extraction of the delivery.
If the labor pains came after the water broke, it is recommended that you ask the midwife to hold herself tight and then rub her belly with the mustard seed and press your hand on her belly and rub it, or if this does not work, take a remedy.
Be confident in the cover, place a pin with an open mouthpiece for the mouth of the patient like the fennel, caraway, betel nut, ginger, turmeric, cardamom, and senna, or some of them, and pour them with water and carry them over the fire, then put a gold tube on the pin of the cover and the other side in the mouth of the patient.
And hold it until the water reaches the root of the patient, then rub as we said, because the labor pains come quickly, and if you are still after this treatment and have not given birth, ask the midwife to moisten her right hand in ointment or ghee.
The textbook then instructs to introduce the hand into the abdomen and spread it slightly, until the affected area is reached. If the hand is attached to the peritoneum, insert your finger as described earlier, until you find the affected area and gently draw it towards the healing process.
To prevent the peritoneum from tearing during strong traction, it is better to move it gently towards the convex and concave sides, and then increase the degree of traction until it responds and separates from the adhesion. If the mouth of the peritoneum is connected, we have described the treatment as desufflation, abdominal massage, and hydration.
If not all of the described treatment is removed, and there is pain during re-traction, it is better to tie the remaining part to the woman's abdomen, then inject the four-percent maraxylin cream, as it relieves it after a few days.
It should be noted that if it becomes infected, it produces a foul smell from the abdomen and the head, which can harm the patient. Therefore, it is better to use the appropriate dressing.
Therefore, some early practitioners tried dressings made of wool and tin, which the woman applies to herself when experiencing abdominal pain and vaginal discharge, and similar conditions.
Create a substance resembling lead or place the thin edge on the cheek and the wide part on fire, apply smoke on the eye until the smoke is gone and repeat again.
The ninth chapter and seventh section.
In the treatment of the non-spiraling wedge.
Many children and their wheeled strollers may have a clogged wheel caused by a thin sheet, it is better for the able-bodied to insert that sheet with their finger or else use a sharp nail and warn the muscle not to touch it.
Then place a magnesia sponge in the drink and oil, and treat it with mercury until it is clean, as I feared that the lead tube would clog for many days and cause the child to vomit.
And the wheeled stroller may also be affected by excessive scarring or wound, it is better that the scarring is cleared and then treated as we mentioned in the treatment and lead Pb.
The eighth section.
In the treatment of the heels that occur at the bottom.
The heels that occur at the bottom are knotted and swollen, they happen near the wheeled stroller outside or in the space from one side and the heel is one or more.
When this difficulty arises, it should be opened and moisture, white or light sand, which may be one of these waters, is drawn from the veins and the lungs, and it is not drawn in. The drawn-in water is known by what comes out of it when the rhubarb and turpentine are used.
However, if it has come out, and it was from the space, it may be one of these waters if it is not drawn in. And if it is drawn in, it may be one of these waters if it is not drawn in. And what is known as the drawn-in water from the seat is not drawn in.
If you insert your little finger into the seat and insert a thin rod into the spinal column, if it is not in the spinal column, then if it is in it, insert a thin rod of lead or a hair from the horse's mane.
Until you feel the rod or the hair in your finger, if you do not feel it with the nail and the spike does not show anything from the rhubarb and turpentine, know that it is not drawn-in and start the treatment.
And if the spinal column is drawn-in, or if it is in the ureter, the evidence is that the urine comes out of it and it does not absorb the drugs, and if it is drawn-in from the thigh or the penis, the sign is that the rod reaches there.
In the absence of bone growth and constant pain in the direction, and the continuous exit of pus from it, and that there is no healing or worsening by marriage, and these afflictions are all of them, not one of them is a true abscess.
The treatment of this is a false abscess for those who twist it due to the ignorance of doctors, and as for those that are not swollen and not chronic, they should be drained with iron according to what I have described and what has been tried, which is to place the wound between your hands on its face.
The leg of the patient will be raised and the thigh will be inclined towards the abdomen, then a lead or mercury rod is inserted if it is in the knee until it reaches where the rod ends, and if the patient feels pain towards the seat, it is recommended that you insert your little finger into the seat.
If you feel the rod in your finger, it has been cut without you feeling between your finger and it with fat or meat, then know for certain that it is swollen and there is no healing in it, as we have said. Do not tire in it.
It has been said that it discharges in some people in the swelling and from the treatment that is required for its benefit, to wrap a thin covering according to the size of the knee as it is presented and inserted into the knee until it reaches the seat, then it is returned twice or three times.
Until you learn that all those excessive, swollen meats resembling a bird's throat have been burned, and then treated with a soothing ointment in the fat until they emerge, then treat those meats that have been burned with the saline margarine, and if it heals, it is cured.
Otherwise, it will never be cured without treatment, and if the probe entered, it did not reach your toe in the seat, there was a thick veil of meat or cloth between the probe and the probe, and you saw the nail in the following skin surface, the skin surface split when the nail first entered. You will pass the split with the probe while it is in the nail until you reach the split where the end of the probe meets and the probe falls, then remove those excessive meats that resemble a bird's throat bird's throat and nothing remains.
Then treat it with the saline margarine until it heals, as your blood flows and there is between you and your work to cut those meats, and the best thing you can do and fastest is to make it with fire or a strong drug because the fire unites two good states, burning those excessive meats.
Cut the veins and wipe away the moisture, then treat it with the boiled stone or the lead-based ointment made with oil until the area is healed and the burnt meat from the piercing is extracted, then treat the wound with the salty margarine made from solidified ham.
The drugs that contain astringent and wipe away are such that if they are inserted, it will be cured and will not cause any pain to return, and if the nutcracker has reached the depth of the seat and below the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the seat and examine it with it.
If you felt the horse and between it and you a veil of fat or meat, and it was near the collapse, then the work in it is only on the way of the taste and the request, because you will use one of three aspects, either to wrap as we said.
Or if you cut it until it reaches the root so that you can easily introduce the ointment and treat from a distance, and do not cut the muscle surrounding the seat so that you speak of the surgeon's exit without intention, then treat it with what we mentioned, maybe it will be cured as we said.
Or if you cut that veil and tie it after cutting it to the near seat as we said, either with the horse or with another sharp tool, then extract those burnt meats that were in the cut all of them to where you can reach by searching.
Then, the surgeon completely cuts through the entire incision with the sharp and upper jaw until it seals off, leaving the nasal opening exposed inside the seat, which is the most delicate part. It may damage the nasal opening on this shape.
And if the sickle enters the nose and was on the side of the seat towards the body surface, with the skin and the edge of the seat, then at that time a curved-sided sickle was used as a spoon on this appearance:
And inserted a loose thread of five threads or so, then inserted the sickle with the thread into the nose until it reaches its base, if it is loose within the seat's frame from inside nearby:
Then, remove the thread from the sickle by inserting your finger into the seat and removing the side of the thread, then straighten both sides and leave it for a day or two, every time the thread cuts through the meat, it becomes well-hardened until the meat between the sides of the threads falls off, and then treat the wound until it heals and comes out:
And if the nose of the nasal opening was not loose, then it would have to be deep in the cheek, and you would not be able to do that for the muscle otherwise, it would cut it. Then make it as we mentioned until it heals:
The image shows the dissection of the shoulder, which is done very deeply, and the other side is not cut so deeply to avoid cutting something that is not needed, as you see.
The chapter is the ninth and eighth.
In the region of the clavicle, where the blood flows and is cut, and it is treated.
The clavicle should be on two sides, either inside the chest it resembles openings like blood or like grapes and it has small and large ones, and the blood flows from it continuously.
One is large and is outside the chest, and in its sides, except that this one which is outside the chest is less humid and it flows clear water or little blood continuously and it is on the color of the skin.
And the treatment of that which is inside the chest is to make the scarlet and it should be agitated until the chest comes out and you see the veins appearing and they speed up and tie them with the spindle or hold them with your finger, then cut it at its roots, if not the spindle does not stick to the moisture and relaxation.
The edge of the scarlet is cut with a rough scratch or a piece of polished brim or it is attracted with your fingers, then it is cut and some of its roots are left to stand on the seat of the kyphosis or the hump for what comes after in the door of the kyphosis.
After treating her with all other methods until she is relieved, if the chair does not allow her to leave, a poultice should be applied to the affected area with a small amount of dampness to cleanse it and speed up the exit when the poultice becomes inflamed. The outer pus-filled puss should then be cleaned.
And it is that she should be taken with tweezers or tied with a needle and cut, then treated as we mentioned until she is relieved, and if one dislikes cutting with iron, it is best to use the scissors on this type, taking a loose thread and inserting it into the probe.
Then draw the pus up and push it through the probe from the other side, bending the ends of the thread under the probe and making it crooked, pushing the pus far and wide until the thread is tightened and the probe is removed, do this with all the pus and leave one that is not cut.
To ease the pain, place a greased cloth on the chair and order the pus to be still, then leave it until it falls if it falls, treat it with the moxa and all other methods until it is relieved.
In the treatment of fractures, many times the toes of the foot and the tightening of the nail are affected. If it does not improve with medicine and time, it is recommended to soak it in the oil of the perfumer or rub it with your hand until it becomes moist and removes the upper layer of skin that prevents it from healing.
Then, treat it until it subsides to the extent that is appropriate, and if it does not subside, repeat the treatment with a more intense soak until it subsides positively and then treat it as it will release.
The second and eighth section.
In the treatment of inverted and non-inverted nails, dull and gnawed toenails.
The nail is only a ring that adorns the color of the body, resembling the top of the nail in all parts of the body, especially in the soles of the feet and fingers, and it causes pain when walking.
It is recommended to cut around the nail and hold it with tweezers or a plier, then remove it from its place and treat it. If you want to keep one of them in the same position, the small, soft, curved, adorned ring on the surface of the body is one of them.
Often, children present with a swollen thumb and treatment involves dilating the thumb, cutting it, or twisting it with a silk thread or wool until it falls off, even if it means burning it or applying strong medicine.
The thumb swollen and not swollen has often been treated with the instrument I remember in treating the wart, and the wart is also a small, protruding, rough growth on the surface of the body that goes deep into the skin and if it gets cold, it resembles a wart.
It is found in the body as a whole and more so in the hands, and treatment involves inserting a tube from a strong spider's web or a scorpion's web into the wart until a circle of the tube surrounds the wart, then you wrap your hand around the tube to cut around the wart.
It is found deep in the meat and the wart is removed from its original position, and if you wish, do this with a glass or iron tube on this image:".
The top of the tube should be open and unobstructed to make it easier for the fingers to hold and turn it, and if you wish, cut off the wart on the side of the thumb where the swelling is.
The third and eighteenth chapter.
In the chapter on the instruments used for enemata, ascari incisions, and colonic irrigation.
The enema tube may be made of brass, copper, or porcelain, and may be made in various sizes according to the users' needs. For treating small children, whose beds are narrow or concave, the enema tubes used should be large and easy to insert, as shown in the enema tube image.
The upper part of the valve that connects to the bladder should be wide and have a flap on both sides, with one side having two thumbs and the other side having one thumb.
The thumbhole on the enema tube should be large or slightly smaller, and the bladder that contains the drugs should be made of animal mucus or of small intestine and should have a square cross-section with a side length of about an inch.
The thumbhole should have many thorns that rotate and are wide between each thorn, followed by a thin thread made of ten strings or similar, which collects the bladder like a tube. When the drug is placed on the top of the bone between two thin plates, and then it is sewn, this is the image of a circular incision and a thickening.
How to sew it is to fill the cavity or the abscess with the drug and make it higher than the probability of suppuration, beware that it is not too hot nor too cold, then the suppuration will rise on its back and raise the legs upwards.
Underneath it is placed a dressing or a salve, then the edge of the suture is drenched with ointment or egg white or galls or similar, and it is inserted into the cavity in this manner, then the servant of the abscess takes it with his hands and cuts it with great force until all that is inside the suture is in the abscess.
Then the suture is removed and the suppuration raises the legs to the wall, because the drug stimulates its exit, let him take as much as he can and if he sleeps all night it was reported in the stomach, then the suture is for the diarrhea and accelerates its exit, so the suture should be withdrawn until it clears.
If it is in the abscess or with hard scars, the suture should be gentle and smooth, as the sutures used by Albucasis for children's suppurations, this is an image of a gentle and smooth suture on his skin.
The Fourth and Eighth Chapter.
In the treatment of surgeries.
The surgeries differ according to the thing that is in the operation and the place where the wound is located.
The things that are in the operations are many such as stone chips, sword cuts, sickles, arrowheads, and such.
And the surgeries according to the places of the body are the wounds that are on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, and such.
I am describing the treatment of some surgeries to make them a standard and law for all surgeries, and I start with simple head surgeries especially because the machine will be mentioned in the first chapter of this third part.
I say that when a simple wound occurred in the head and there was no fracture of the bone, if it was a stone chip or such, and the skin had only swollen and the wound was large, and I feared the occurrence of the hard tumor, I quickly and carefully lifted the quilt from the bed. Do not delay the extraction of blood from the vein in proportion to its strength, unless it obstructs the flow, especially if the blood exiting from the wound flows smoothly and the obstruction is against the exposed side.
The physician warned of the excess, drunkenness, and heavy foods, for if obstruction occurs, one should reduce food intake, avoid fatty meats, and alcoholic beverages, and if a hot cloth is applied to the wound or with alcohol alone or with an alcoholic beverage present.
If the tumor is hot, apply heat to the wound if it has not changed its color and the air does not change it after a short time, but if it has changed, apply some cooling agents.
Until the wound is fully healed and treated to remove it, if the wound is large and was caused by a cut or similar injury and has not been cured by the rafad, gather it with sutures on the abdominal surgical gauze.
If the skin is peeling off the bone and has not been cleaned except in a small wound, cut it off and treat the wound with drugs to replace the hard skin with soft skin, and the physician advises eating foods rich in vitamins such as brains and skulls, and similar ones.
If there is a pustule on the skin that is not attached to the bone, cut it all off and wash it, then treat it. If in these surgeries there is a vein or blood vessel that is bleeding from it but has not been stopped by medication, examine the vein.
If the wound does not heal, tie it with a bandage and reinforce it. If necessary, even if it does not help what we mentioned, cut it until the blood stops. If these surgeries are simple and easy, order them to be treated by simply closing the wound with what is left of its blood.
Before the air changes, describe the wound as follows: take a part from the lard, another from the gut, and three parts of the grease or non-greasy intestine, wrap all of them together, and insert and close the wound well so that it sticks to a good patch.
And let it be for the blood, then wrap it with rafaad and leave it until it does not absorb anything, as long as it does not expel the medicine, and the gut may do this alone if the lard and gut are not available.
And this action can also be done on the eyes in many major surgeries if the placement and wrapping are well done, and the wound was dry before the air changed, and if the air changed a little, especially during summer.
Do not consider this thorn to have a meaningful treatment as we mentioned that it can be carried on some sharp tools or it can carry an almond from flour made with water and sugar until the wound is filled, then treat it with other methods until it is cleansed.
And what about if the wound occurs in the bone and it was slow? Attract it with a gentle touch, and as mentioned in the treatment of wounds on the head in ophthalmic surgery, if the wound occurs in the eye, it is not different from the wound in the head if it is simple in terms of treatment.
And if a nerve or string was cut from the eye, and it is a nerve, then there is no need to avoid treating it with severe tweezers like the hand and finger, as they cause pain and injury to the nerve.
Do not place something cold on the wound as the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection to the brain, which is the most important organ, and what is treated with the cold drugs like the nourishing water several times emulsified with oil or ointment of rose and almond is.
And if you also clean the metal stones and wet tools on this basis, and as for the wound if it is large, use the suture or apply gauze with ointments then treat it until it is cleansed.
In case of surgery, if a wound is deep and there is a gathering of pus at its bottom, it means that the intestine has been cut and its blood has oozed out or been tied or sealed. If necessary, it should be done.
If the wound has cut some tendons of the Achilles or all of them, and the pulse has ceased, then gather the edges of the skin with sutures on the Achilles tendon and do not compress it but leave it in its natural shape, then tighten it firmly and evenly for a few days.
Then treat it with gauze that has a clamp and drainage until it is expelled, if the wound has affected the bone, then search for any pieces of bone in it or what can be taken from it and what cannot, and leave the rest until the wound is healed and expelled and made easier to remove.
If the wound is long, let it be treated with the nails we described earlier, if the bone becomes spongy and becomes a punch, treat it with what is mentioned in that chapter, which is surgery for the chest and between the shoulders.
If the wound is from a sword or a dagger and you see pus coming out of it, look at it, if the wind comes out of it when the person breathes, know that it is a combat wound, if it does not have pus and is long, do not put the nails in it first, and do not tighten it for fear that the blood will clot in the pus.
In the heart, the poison kills the patient; but if a piece of cloth is placed in it twice a day, and the wound is kept clean, the patient will recover.
Do not open the wound if no inflammation or tightness is present, and if three days have passed since the injury; if all other symptoms are normal, then treat the wound with a poultice and complete the treatment until it heals.
If the wound cannot be seen or the pulse is not felt, know that the patient has become collapsed; treat the wound from the opening, and if three days have passed since the injury, treat it with splints.
If the wound is large or near the bones, and it has affected the bone and caused splinters to be cut off, clean the wound and remove the splinters if they are protruding; if they are not protruding, leave them until they fall out.
The wound will heal if it is easy to remove, and other emergency surgeries on other organs are treated according to the treatment mentioned earlier.
Chapter Five and Eighteen.
In abdominal surgery and the removal of the umbilicus and its stitching.
The incision that exposes the abdomen may be large or small, and middle, and the large one may expel the umbilicus or several intestines, making its insertion and stitching more difficult.
And the small incision may also be difficult from another angle, so it must be stitched more carefully and the umbilicus if it does not start to move when it is inserted into its place, it will be difficult to insert it, therefore the medium-sized incision is better because it does not make it difficult to stitch the umbilicus as in these two types.
And know that stitching the abdomen on four sides of the two stitches is suitable for stitching the abdomen and for stitching other surgeries of the body and the stitches are specialized for other surgeries except that they are excellent in stitching the abdomen.
And I will explain it to you in one way and provide a description, so I say that if the wound is small and something from the umbilicus came out of it and it was difficult to stitch it back, that is due to one of two reasons, either the incision is small as we said, or because the umbilicus was exposed to wind before the air cooled.
When it is necessary, this should be heated by immersing an icepack or a damp cloth in boiling water alone or having cooked in it dates, almonds, and spices, and then wiping it with vinegar until the wind escapes.
And the drink that contains ginger is better than water alone in dissolving wind, if you see the wind has dissolved, wipe the vinegar with water that has been boiled with ginger or turmeric, as it will enter more easily.
If recovery is difficult after this treatment, a small incision can be made with the forceps and the first remedy if it is more effective in healing, but it will have to be made only when necessary and due to failure of the hymen, and this is a picture of the tool:
The one that is cut should be limited and the other one not, the narrow side is not rough but slightly wet and it resembles a small saw as you see, if the incision enlarges and enters the vinegar then it should be treated in its natural form.
The place for it if possible is best, and if the incision is wide and was at the bottom of the abdomen, it should be lifted on its chest and make the thighs higher than the head, and if it was at the top of the abdomen, it makes the head and neck higher than the body.
If the incision is in one of the abdominal walls, your intention and purpose should always be the higher part, and thus it is advisable to use this method in major surgeries and in medium surgeries.
For small surgeries, place the incision according to what you are capable of, then prepare a helper on your right side who will hold the entire incision with both hands and stitch it together. Then remove the suture for the patient to remove the sutures one by one.
This is the general suturing technique, which involves taking a needle or several needles on the size of the wound, then leaving a part of the suture as wide as the gallbladder and passing one needle without inserting a thread into its edges. Then, with the two ends of the suture from inside until they are all out from that side, and when the wound edges meet, wrap a fine thread around the needle several times on both sides until the wound edges come together in a neat way.
Then, leave the end of the thumb as wide as possible and pass another needle, then entangle it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Keep doing this until the wound is completely exposed and the needle is evenly distributed between the tension and the tightness.
For the scissors, it is best to make a mid-cut through the meat and fat, as it is difficult to penetrate the skin. Therefore, it should be cut in the middle of the meat and fat, not at the edge of the skin.
Do not cut the meat too quickly, and do not open the wound before closing it, and do not cut the scissors' handles to avoid hurting the patient's eye when he sleeps and causing him discomfort from a wide gap on both sides of the handle.
Leave it until you learn that the wound has healed, and this type of scissors is suitable for small surgeries because it may be sufficient to close it with one or two or so.
Or, the second type of scissors is that it collects with the four-edged scissors and the two-edged scissors in one cut with a scalpel in it, which is a moderately open blade in the cut and the gap, then if you perform this cut, you repeat the scalpel from the same side.
The blade should be sharpened from the top of the wound to make the scissors like the blade of the rasp that the patient uses and to leave a small gap between each blade, after the little finger is squeezed, this blade is known by everyone.
In this excerpt, the surgeon drew an incision on a man's abdomen where he had previously injured him with a sickle and the wound was deeper than a thumbnail. He then exited through two inches of the middle of the belly, and the wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
She reopened it after the abdomen was closed outside for fourteen hours, and the wound healed in about fifteen days. It was treated until it was cured and lived for many years, managing all situations. The doctors decided that he could not cure the wound.
It is interesting that I did not treat it with a poultice because there was nothing in the position where I was, so I applied cotton twice a day on the wound and promised to clean it with grape wine until it healed.
As for one of the types of surgical gauze, I remember it in the speech of Galen as follows: start the gauze from the skin and insert the forceps from outside to inside, if the forceps pierces the skin and the muscle that is advancing towards the stretch in the whole belly.
I left the edge of the incision in the side where I inserted the forceps and it pierced the other edge of the incision from inside to outside in the other edge of the abdomen. If it pierces it again in this same edge from outside to inside.
Peel the skin from this side and remove the forceps from its other end, turning it inside out, and remove it through the skin into the edge of the incision on the opposite side until all of it is removed.
Then, starting from this side with the line and point, remove the forceps from the skin on the other side and bring it back into the same skin, then place it in the line of the incision on the other side with this line of the moraqab.
And remove it from the skin on that side, and do this several times until all of the surgery is done on this example, and this sentence of this bandage is to cut the bandage for the wound.
And cut the bandage once from one side with the line of the skin and leave it once from the other side until it is completely removed, and the second type of bandage mentioned by Galen is also a saying.
And it is that the surgeons do the same as they collect all parts and match them with their corresponding problems in the bandage, and they bring the edge of the incision to its other edge and the edge of the moraqab to its other edge, which is what I mentioned earlier.
It is preferred that you sew the needle from the edge of the sheet nearby to you, pull it inside and leave it alone in it, then push the needle from outside to inside in the second sheet, both of them then pull it out again.
And pull it from inside to outside in the second sheet that is on the opposite side, this beating of the gutta-percha is better than the easy gutta-percha, which is the one that is mentioned, as said by Jalenos in its pure form, and some say that the abdominal wall can be fixed with two needles. And that is to insert a thread in them and start by pushing the needle from you and pulling it to the other side and then push the other needle from the opposite side for the gutta-percha according to the stitching of the sutures, whether.
And know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then the stitching of it is harder than the rest of the abdominal wall, and as for closing the incision, its judgment is based on the judgment of other surgeries because you know the incision by touching it before the air changes it, and you redrew the thread and closed it, then hold the poultice and the string on it.
When the wound is altered by air, cover it with some absorbent materials that will prepare it until the threads are cut and the suture and stitching are done, then treat it like any other surgical wound until it heals.
If you have no medicines, cover the wound with cotton cloth and replace it twice a day as I have told you until it heals, and if the surgeries are simple, you don't need any other treatment. But if you fear that the pain will spread to the main members, cover them with cotton cloth.
It is recommended that you wrap our ointment in a warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the ribs and the breast, and if you feel pain or dryness in that area, often apply black horse serum to relieve it.
Especially when dryness reaches the chest and becomes a wide wound, know that what was previously hard in the stomach is easier to remove and what was soft is harder to remove.
And the stomach known as the fasting one does not allow removal of surgery that has occurred on it because of its many veins, bones, and hardness of the wound and closeness to the nature of the nerve. And if the wound was caused by sharp pain and you noticed it carefully, remove it according to your stomach's reaction, whether.
If the leg has been long in the bed or is black, it should be dressed above the area that is blacker, otherwise bleeding from the veins will be exposed. There are valves and cords in the thigh, then cut off what is below that.
Make the ends of the suture threads project below the incision from outside it to make it easier to sew and remove it when the thrust falls and to heal the wound, mention the wound that is exposed in the dressing, but if a crack is exposed in the dressing and it was small.
It may happen that some people do not believe that a man was injured in his belly by a lancet and the wound was on the right side of the stomach and it became ulcerated and the pus came out of it and I treated him on the assumption that he was not cured. I did not stop my care until it was cured and the wound was healed, but when I saw the wound had healed I was afraid that something bad might happen to him in his belly, but he did not suffer from any abscess and remained in the best of health. Indeed, he eats and drinks and goes to the bath and enters the bath and rests in his service, and some of the practitioners have mentioned that when the wound is exposed in the dressing and it was small, it should be covered on this basis.
The excerpt translates to: "It is that the large-headed mice take their heads, then gather the edges of the wound, then place one of them on the wound's edge if caught and squeezed, its head cuts off, and it sticks together without leaking, then another mouse is placed nearby.
The excerpt translates to: "And it continues to do so with several mice on the wound's edge, then scrape the wound, and those heads remain stuck in the dough until the dough thickens and pushes out and does not cause any harmful effect, and the dough may also be cut by a thin knife.
The excerpt translates to: "That which sticks the animal with a stuck head after entering the forceps, is that it takes one end of this knife from Mصران and it does stick, indeed, then ties it in the forceps' other end a thin, loose knife, then this knife enters the forceps. The excerpt translates to: "And in it, the Mصران knife cuts the dough and then returns to the hole, and this striking of the knife by the mouse and Mصران is only on the way of tasting and pleasing.
The excerpt translates to: "And if the cut is large and wide, and especially if it is in one of the mucous membranes, there is no danger and no harm from it.
The sixth and eighth chapters.
In the treatment of gallstones and gallbladder.
When a wound or abscess becomes infected and forms an abscess, it does not penetrate the tissue and remains open. This is called an abscess in any organ, and we call it a gallstone or gallbladder when it occurs in the gallbladder.
In reality, the gallstone is a hard, white mass that causes no pain and has a smooth surface like the feather of a bird.
Therefore, it was called a feather by some, and it can be wet at times, with the gallstone always being open and sometimes the moisture has disappeared in some cases, which can be abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
It has been mentioned in the division regarding surgery that no abscess is ever cleansed or grows meat in it, for there are nine reasons for this, either because of a lack of blood in the body, or because of its dryness, or because there is firm meat inside and on the surface that prevents the growth of good meat. Or, it may be that they are many in number and dry, or because the abscess itself is light and the matter that opens it is rough in texture, or because the medicine is not suitable for treating it, or because the disease has spread to the neighborhood of the gallbladder, or because it is a special case in the neighborhood.
Or, it may be that they are many in number and dry, or because the abscess itself is light and the matter that opens it is rough in texture, or because the medicine is not suitable for treating it, or because the disease has spread to the neighborhood of the gallbladder, or because it is a special case in the neighborhood. In the city of Saragossa, diseases take longer to develop and operations are delayed due to the slow healing of wounds, which could be attributed to either a single bone or multiple bones. The causes, symptoms, and treatments with medications have been explained in detail in the classification.
It is important for me to know that you want to know about the treatment of gout and hematoma, which can be performed manually. I will inform you that gout can occur in any part of the body, including large joints, tendons, or nerves.
Or to the foot, or to the thigh, or to the groin, or to the buttock, or to the knee joint, or to the elbow joint, or to the wrist, and so on, which can lead to the proximity of major organs and similar.
As for this gout, if it did not reach the affected areas mentioned, such as the joints, tendons, or nerves, it would not be considered an incurable disease and would not cause despair and confusion in its treatment.
And you wanted to know about this, take a copper or iron probe if the gout is passing over a flat surface and examine it with it, as the lead is used because it softens the gout due to its ability to soften the body.
When entering and turning towards the incision, if the patient has many holes in their nose, you cannot determine them with the probe later. Instead, insert one nail into one of their nostrils. The moisture that fills it will flow through the other nostrils and drip.
Then, thoroughly examine the face you can reach to determine if there is a bone or nerve, or if the patient's nose is far or close, or if it is a single nose with many holes. Stand on all of this based on your intuitive evidence of pain in the area where you touch with your hand.
In relation to the symptoms and causes of the tumor, if you stand on all of this and stand on the truth, then it leads to treatment with confidence and that is to look when it is.
The tumor is visible near or in a position that is distant from the limb, nerve, or vessel, or one of the locations I mentioned to you. Then, cut the tumor according to what has been described and remove whatever is in it of decayed meat and excess meat.
And what comes out of his mouth is not meat or gristle and in the same way, treat it until it is expelled, if the nose is far from the root and was on a firm basis, then it should be cut in the depth that you can, then clean it of all decayed meat.
Then use the fused pills from strong drugs and fuse them to the lion's nail, which is grasped by iron. Do this several times until the strong drug is completely consumed from the lion's nail of corruption.
Then force it with the maces that produce fat correctly until it is cleared, for if it is not cleared by this, then it will be your fault and the reason for the lion's strength and health in your hand, so examine it and cut it according to what you were told, if it does not prevent you from preventing.
If the bone or nerve or main part of the body is broken as we said, then remove the bone and remove the impurities in it until the impurities are gone, then treat it with what cures it until it is clear, for if it is not clear and the wound does not heal as it used to.
Know that you have not removed all the corruption, remove everything else second and clean and purify it with all your effort then force it, for if it is cured then know that this corruption is far from the other corruption and remove everything else second.
And clean and purify it with all your effort then remove the impurities, for if the broken bone was a small bone and you could attract it, then attract it with the sharp pliers that are suitable for this.
If the bones are many, draw them all and leave none behind, for your effort will not be in vain. If something obstructs the tendons before them, do not despair, as there is no risk in cutting those tendons and muscles if they are present, and complete the bones.
If you do not feel the bones move from the time you start, carry the wound with whatever it presses on the bones and muscles and tendons, and keep the wound open so it does not become infected during your work.
But if you fear that it may become infected, wrap it in a damp cloth with vinegar or in a cloth soaked in olive oil, or in one of the damp cloths used for ablutions, and if it swells and the bones become loose, they will be easy to extract.
If a single large bone like the thigh or knee bone and its surrounding parts became infected and swollen, it should be excised completely until all the pus and swelling have disappeared. If a large part of the bone was affected and the infection had reached the bone marrow, it is necessary to open the wound wide.
Until the corruption ends, it is treated until it heals, and I tell you about Zakam who was presented to a man in his leg to serve as an example and aid in your treatment, this man was a case of the year.
About thirty years ago, he was presented to him with pain in his leg due to the movement inside the body until the materials reached the leg and swelled greatly, and there was no cause from outside, then time passed with the mistakes of doctors until the wound opened.
Many materials and bad for his treatment until the leg swelled and many holes appeared in it that moistened the skin and the body's humors, he was treated by a group of doctors for two years, but they were not skilled in craftsmanship.
Until I saw his leg and the materials flowing from those holes, great swelling, and the man had emptied his body color and inserted the screw into one of those holes, the screw pierced the bone, then all the holes were exposed.
I found some of them pierced through each other from all sides of the leg, I drilled on one of them until I exposed some bones, I found it rotten, eaten, blackened, and shattered, I pulled out the nail to the marrow, I spread what I found to him.
I have equipped myself with the rotten bone and I think that there is no other rottenness in the bone but that which was cut and spread, and then I restored it, then I forced the wound with the magical drugs for a longer time, it did not touch then, I repeated the examination and I discovered another bone above the first one.
I found the rottenness connected to the bone and I spread what I also found of that rottenness, then I forced it out, but it did not force out and did not touch either, then I discovered it again above the first one, I did not cut the bone piece by piece and I closed its wound, it does not force out until I cut off a part of the bone.
I removed it with its covering, then I forced it out with the drugs, the wound healed quickly and was clean, and this repetition was necessary for the operation and dissection of the weak bone and low probability and fear of death from it because it happened to him in every time from excessive exploration, it was covered and healed completely.
It grew in the position of the bone in firm flesh and healed its condition in his body, it reduced his strength and directed him to his conditions, and it did not expose him to danger that harms his joints, if the bone is in a place in the body that has cracked.
It is recommended to place it on this sheet and take a thread, insert it into the end of the bone, and order whoever ties it to tie it above and make another thread of gold finer than the first.
Then tie it on the fat under the bone, stretch its side to draw the fat downwards, and you will reveal the position you want to expose without harming the hanging fat, and place a board or sheet under the bone from below firmly.
For if you do this, the hanging fat will not stop cutting the bad bone, and it is recommended that the exposure be above the position of the bad bone rather than in a twist of the bone so that the bad part is not visible in its appearance for the observer, and you will have to expose it again.
If the bone is bad and not separate but connected by some parts of it, or the badness is in the middle or in some parts of it, remove all the fat from all sides of it, then place the board from below, and expose it from the first side where the badness is.
If you have exposed it from the other side, expose it from a distance from the badness as we said, and if the badness is in a separate part, cut the separate bad part and expose the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the wound is in a distal part, there is no other remedy than amputation, whether it's on the hand or the leg. The treatment of the wound is difficult and should be cleaned as much as possible, dried, and purified at any stage you can.
And by what means do you purify yourself when blood or nerve does not hinder you, and know that there are many amputations and incisions for these bones according to the position of the bone, its placement, its thickness, its brittleness, its strength, and its weakness. Therefore, it is recommended that you have a machine for each type of work.
And know that the work itself may indicate the type of machine you need if you have a long apprenticeship and knowledge of this craft because it is a noble craft and a witness to many diseases. It may happen that what you think causes the machines for each disease is shown to you in this chapter, and I am a witness for you at the end of this book several machines.
Make it an example to be admired and a standard to compare with others, insha'Allah, a picture of clarity.

A similar-shaped hollow for a thigh bone is made from Indian iron, and it is also recommended to make all the parts mentioned in the text, such as the cuts and the molds.
The seventh and eighth sections.
In cutting the ribs and bones.
The ribs may rot either from without or within, and if the rot is treated with medication and the medication fails to cure it, I have seen the rot moving towards the organ without being repelled by anything.
It is recommended to cut the affected organ to the point where the rot ceases, so that it may not die from this or from a great calamity, which is an indication that the rot has overcome the organ until you think that the fire has burned it.
Or the rot may spread after the fever, until it reaches the organ and engulfs it, and then you should cut it, and also if the cause of the rot is a blockage in some of the veins such as the thigh or calf veins, and so on.
If the rot or swelling is in the finger, cut off the finger and do not let the rot spread to the hand, and if it has already reached the hand, cut it off from the base of the nail and do not let the rot spread to the shoulder.
Also, if one cuts the arm at the elbow joint, and sees that the wound is towards the humerus, do not cut the forearm bone for in that is the death of the patient, and use other treatment according to power.
Also, if one cuts the toe, cut it at one of the nails, and if one cuts the leg, cut it by its bones, and if it rises to the knee, cut the thigh at the knee joint.
And if the wound reaches the knee, there is no hope except to leave it and amputate the limb or leave another one above the desired position and leave another one below the position.
And extend the first graft below and extend the other graft above and leave the meat between the grafts with a thin slice until the meat is all exposed, then cut or leave it, and it is better to place the slice from all sides on the incision.
So that the graft does not reach the right position, causing excessive pain and suppuration, if you notice bleeding during your work, quickly cut the position or place some of the cut tendons on the blood and then return to treatment until it is exhausted.
Then, attach the transplanted member to its respective tendon and treat it until it is completely removed. I will now give you an example of a man with this affected part in his leg, this eye that I described to you, which occurred in his leg, similar to fire.
And that deformity was the first thing that happened to his finger until the man took everything from himself because he saw the deformity spreading in the member with such intensity of pain and fire only cut it at the joint.
When time passed, he saw the deformity in his little finger of his left hand and I suggested to him to remove that deviation by cutting the red dot with what he had on his hand after cleaning his body, but it did not remove the deformity and made it spread in his other finger.
Until he took the deformity into his hand, I asked him to cut his hand and cut off his finger with my request on his wrist of that deviation and I was afraid for him when cutting his hand because the power of man was on the fall, so when he got scared, he went back to his country.
I was told that he cut his hand with his own hands and removed it, and I only told this story to be an aid for what may happen of this kind of disease and to be a evidence that can be used against it.
The eighth and eighteenth chapters.
In the treatment of abscesses and how to inject them with drugs.
If a wound occurs in some of the muscly organs and the duration of the wound extends until all the duration is exhausted, either it inflames or becomes a cavity and all that was in it is expelled, leaving the position empty as if it were a container.
And the skin that was like a crack and was not yet corrupt as to affect bone, nerve, or tendon, therefore it is appropriate to call it an abscess and was never called a fistula except when its duration extends until corruption affects something of these organs.
Therefore, it is called a fistula or a fissure, and its treatment is to cut off that entire skin as it rotates, especially if it has become corrupt like a crack and it is observed that it does not adhere to the position due to corruption.
If the wound is not yet corrupted and was only a lump in the skin, it was treated by injection, and that means looking at the abscess if it is large and the smell emanating from it is strong, then inject it with Egyptian medicine.
The text describes a process involving oil, honey, and cinnamon. It instructs to mix these ingredients in a bowl and cook until the medicine turns into a thick syrup, then add your desired amount of the mixture, soak it with water and honey, and apply the ointment to the affected area for about two hours.
After removing the ointment, repeat this process daily until the ointment is completely absorbed and the wound has healed. If the ointment is not available, you can use the ox gall from the cow or the gall of the buffalo, soak it in water.
After applying the ointment, wait until it is completely absorbed and the wound has healed. If there is no oil or gall in the ointment, you can apply a mixture of water and honey containing something from the cinnamon.
Or you can apply a mixture of honey and wine, as the honey cleans and softens the ointment, and the wine makes it supple and does not crack. If you repeat this process several times, you will notice that the ointment has completely disappeared and you can apply a mixture of meat fat to it.
For example, you can take some honey and replace it with a dough made of wheat flour, water, and wine, or apply it with some of the other ointments and medicines we have mentioned in the article about the medicines. If the mouth of the ointment is narrow and does not allow the tube of the ointment to enter, do not apply it.
He expanded it slightly with iron or added a small piece of melted lead in the Egyptian or Sirikon mouth until it expanded, and similarly if the mouth is wide, he gathered the corners of the gum around it without adding anything more to the extent that the insert fits.
And if the mouth from which the saliva flows is high, he cut it in the lowest part of it so that the saliva flows downwards because if the saliva enters the cavity, it prevents the meat from growing in it.
And if you cannot cut the cavity downwards as you wish, then place the organ in a way that the saliva flows easily from it according to what suits you and prevent anything of the hard saliva from entering it.
And the salty drugs that are placed on the cavity from outside and how they are placed on it is that you take one of the problematic salty remedies that you want and spread it on a small piece of linen and make the cut in the linen as much as the cavity contains. Then you take a small piece of gauze around the mouth of the cavity and make a larger cut in the mouth of the cavity slightly, then spread a soft remedy on another piece of gauze of the same size as the cut and place it on top of the cavity, leaving some distance from the mouth of the cavity to make it easier for the saliva to come out and do not remove the large incision unless.
Several days later, the one that is on the mucous membrane of the cavity is the one that is removed at all times to remove what has gathered in it from the hairs and to know what will come from it of the new hair. Is it much or little, sharp or blunt, or non-sharp?
And also, you should check the position of the cavity itself whether it hurts the owner of it in it or not, and whether there is a worm or not in it, if you proceed with the treatment like this and see the material that comes out slowly on the mucous membrane of the cavity.
Know that the cavity has been closed or is approaching closure when this happens, and to close it on the following day or in three days, and when the wound heals, replace the fissure with another one and renew the mucus, for if new hair comes out after a long time of thin new hair, do not worry about closing it.
It is close because some people who slow down the growth of meat in their surgery and among them is one who does not, if new hair comes out after a long time of non-sharp hair, know that the cavity has not been closed and if the closure of the cavity is slow, then it is the cavity that is slow to close.
And it lasts for a long time in drying the drugs and to have drugs that are moist on their surface and dry in their strength like the mucus of the oak if they increase in it, then increase the anxiety of the tension, and inform what is treated with the fact that the mucus of the oak is taken.
In this excerpt, Albucasis describes a method for preparing an old, mild wine by passing it through a cloth and then using it for its intended purpose. He also mentions that this process can be done if the desired wine is not available, by using a substitute such as honey wine or grape juice. The author emphasizes the importance of patience, endurance, and perseverance in this process, and warns against wasting the wine by heating it excessively. Then, he pours it onto a strainer and presses it against the bottle or lets it drip with the old wine that was cooked until it thickens, and places the pills on top and presses them. This step suggests that the author is preparing a medicinal wine by adding pills to it and pressing them to release their active ingredients. The use of pills in this context is reminiscent of ancient medical practices, where herbs and other natural substances were used to treat various ailments.
In this excerpt, Albucasis mentions that certain substances such as the long pepper, saffron from Spain, and anise seeds can be used in a similar manner to treat various ailments. He emphasizes the importance of using these substances correctly and not wasting them, as he warns that if they are left unused, they may cause harm. This statement reflects the ancient medical practice of using natural substances to treat illnesses, and the need for proper knowledge and skill in their use.
In this excerpt, Albucasis states that certain substances can have an effect on the bones or other hard tissues such as tendons and ligaments, and that they can be used to treat nerve pain. He recommends using the treatment of the Narcissus as a reference for the appropriate use of these substances, indicating that the Narcissus has been known to have medicinal properties in ancient medical practices. This statement highlights the importance of using natural substances to treat various ailments, and the need for proper knowledge and skill in their use.
The 9th and 8th sections.
This section covers the treatment of dislocated and fractured fingers, as well as excessive finger nails and broken finger joints.
The dislocated thumb is a large piece of meat that grows under the affected hand or arm, and may grow on other fingers as well. If left untreated, it can become infected and cause serious problems. It is important to treat it promptly and properly.
Or, if it becomes infected and spreads to the bone, it may become very serious and cause a foul smell on the finger tip and a yellowish color. If treated as described in the division, it should not have spread.
It is recommended to cut all the growth that comes from the fracture with a knife, and then close the wound afterward. This is very beneficial, and if the bone is also healthy and the fracture was also healthy.
The hole in the fracture was filled with meat, which caused it to swell and become infected. It is recommended to place a thin piece of cloth under the fracture hole that causes the meat to swell and raise it above the surface, and then cut the meat off.
And place the remaining meat on antiseptic ointment until all of it is gone, and then treat it with the ointment until it is clean. If the infection has affected the bone, it is recommended to cut off that bone and remove it, as it will not be cleaned unless the bone is also infected.
The surgeon observed the consumption and corruption, aiming it in the little finger, then cut it off at one of the clean places as he mentioned, and then treat it until it is clean. If the flame is a blow or a wound, it happens in it, causing severe pain, it is better to amputate the little finger first.
Then the flame should be cut horizontally, from top to bottom, and kept from reaching the meat underneath the flame, as you will speak of this on the little finger, causing severe pain, which is a cause for excessive meat growth in that place. Then treat the place with what soothes the wound.
And the extra fingers that grow in some people's hands, it was all meat and sometimes bones, and sometimes fire, and it grows in some of them in a distal part of some fingers.
Or it grows in some clean places of the fingers and does not move, which grows at the distal end of the finger, maybe it moved because only the meat was left, then cutting it makes it easier to cut it at its root with a wide horizontal cut.
And the growth in the distal end of the finger is difficult to treat, and if it grows on a clean place of the finger, it is better to cut its meat first, then spread the bone with one of those corresponding nails.
Then he deals with it until it is removed, and as for the incision that exposes some fingers to others, this is often the case and is what humans bear and is seen when wounds or burns from fire occur, and in this way, it is advisable to cut this incision.
Until the fingers return to their natural position, then place a plaster or a crack between them in olive oil so that it does not quickly stick to them or make a thin lead sheet between them until the situation improves as it should.
And also, if the incision exposes some fingers to others, then cut this incision according to what suits and restores the shape of the organ.
The ninth book.
In cutting the wounds.
The wounds are dark-colored scars that are tightly wrapped and cause pain in more parts of the body, especially in the legs and thighs, and most notably in the knee, ankle, and waist, so it is advisable to first remove the black blood from the body several times with strong nitrates.
Then remove the base of the wound, and as for treating it with iron, it will be on two blows, one of which is to cut and the other to let out the black blood and the other face to make the blood flow with its own color and come out in its entirety, and if it is cut, it will cause the leg to separate first by hot water, yes.
Until the thick, cloudy blood is absorbed, then sharply flex the knee of the affected leg, seizing it with one hand and holding it down with the other, and then gently rub the affected area in one place or in two or three wide places.
Then, let the black blood flow from your hand from below the knee upwards until you see enough or as much as you can bear of the affected blood, then tie it and order it to abstain from the food produced by the black day and it will reabsorb and dry.
When the joints are filled and cause pain in the affected leg, and if the leg has much hair, then wash it with hot water and rub the leg with it until it reddens and dries or becomes a strong movement.
If the leg is not washed with hot water until it is heated, then gently flex the skin around the affected area, either at the knee or at the ankle, and then open the skin with your fingers and dry the affected area from all sides until it appears to the touch.
If the affected area appears red and swollen, then if you remove it from the skin, it will look like a wound. Then, insert your fingers underneath it until it rises and comes out of the skin, tie it with a thin, damp gauze, and then gently flex the skin around the affected area three inches away from the previous one.
After removing the skin from the dye, then lift it up as you did and tie it with another thread as you did first, then cut or make several cuts if it became necessary.
Then pull and cut it at the end of the first slit near the tip, then draw it back into the second slit until it comes out of the third slit and draw it up to the top of all the slits until all of them come out, then cut them off.
If you do not need to pull and cut, insert a strong wire with a fine thread, tie it, pull it, and insert under it with your hand to all sides until it comes out and keep it so it does not break, if it breaks, it will be difficult for you to pull it again.
And it enters on the wound from it, if you pull it all, put it in the position of the surgery with a glass dish filled with water and oil or ointment and treat it until it is cleaned, and if the incision is wrinkled with folds on its sides.
And if it was not in its shape as we said, it is better to cut it at each side of its wrinkles and folds on the places of the creases, then tie it with the threads until all of them are squeezed, and keep it in mind that you cut the fat or scrape it if it is difficult for you to pull it back, to save your effort.

Image of the large intestine:
It does not have a sharp point and is not as rough as others to avoid cutting the flesh, lest it pierce the tissue with its sharpness, but it has a gentle edge like we said.
Chapter the thirtieth and the ninetieth.
In the city's flesh salve.
This flesh grows in the thighs in hot countries like Hijaz and Arab lands, and in some hot countries with little fat, and it may grow in other parts of the body not including the thighs, and it grows from scars that occur under the skin.
Just as it happens inside the alive and dead bodies, the wounds and scars that occur between the skin and the fat, and an indication that this flesh begins to appear when it appears in the thigh, it swells then the place becomes empty and then the flesh begins to come out from that empty place.
As if it were a plant or an animal, if it appears from it, it is better to cut it with a small piece of copper that is its nail from one end to the other and dry it and leave the copper stuck in the thigh.
Whenever something is removed from its place in the lead, it is cut and the rest is left. Do not cut it from the original before it all comes out, because if you cut it, it shrinks and enters into the meat, causing a wound and ulceration in that place, with a ragged, raw edge.
Therefore, it should be handled and slowly removed until nothing remains of it in the body, and in some people it may come out of this mass five cubits and ten.
It was reported to me that it came out of a man of twenty pieces, if you cut it while treating him for it, you insert a gouge into the wound and draw it out long with the body until all material is removed from it, and try to heal the place with drugs for days.
Then he is treated with the treatment of the boils, and this mass may have many types and especially if it appears in the male or female's leg, it causes many holes and comes out of each hole in the face, and it is treated as we mentioned in the classification and according to what has been achieved.
The second part of the ninth book.
On the operation performed on the child born under the belly of the cow, called the disease of the ox.
This disease is called "goat's woe" in some of the countries we have, due to its frequent exposure to goats. It is a small, single lump that develops between the skin and meat, and spreads throughout the body, both ascending and descending.
It is visible to the touch on its surface, wherever it penetrates the skin, until it reaches the bone, where it exits and forms a wound from which some pieces of metal are exposed, as it is also exposed to dough and lives and fleas in the belly.
And it is expected from its evil that if it penetrates the body and spreads to the head, reaching the eye, and then opens it and exits, it may blind the eye, and it is often seen, so if you want to treat it and remove it, it can only be done when it appears in its surface.
It is best to cut it off and remove it, as it has not found the meat in it, and hold it on the affected place with fire until it burns, and the greatest fear is that it will damage the eye, as we have said.
If I see it has entered the head near the eye, cut under it on the neck with a strong bandage, and remove it, and it is recommended that the patient clean his body with easy drugs for sharp metallic impurities and to protect the food that causes the wound from the wound.
The third book and nineteenth chapter.
In the section dealing with the disease known as Naphthuta.
This disease, known as Naphthuta in our country, is a wound that appears on some parts of the body and then spreads from one part to another. I have seen it as you describe.
I was sent to a woman who lived in a distant village. I examined her arm and blew gently on the tendon of her arm. When an hour had passed, I saw that this breathing was rubbing against the tendon as if it were rubbing against the dough with the speed of the bread knife moving towards its end.
If I blew from the affected part to the opposite side, the pain disappeared from that place and moved towards the end of the tendon. After an hour, it spread throughout the body until it reached the other arm, and she told me that her whole body was moving as she had seen.
I was surprised by the speed at which the pain spread from one part to another and had not seen anything like this before on this patient, except that I had seen a group of people who were experiencing pain spreading from one part to another, but I had not seen it like this.
I could not understand it except that the woman might have come from a remote village with a thin body and open chest, so this wind-like pain became apparent. It was necessary for it not to be seen in the healthy and moist bodies and the hidden chests.
When you desire to treat it and feel the pain of its owner, if the abscess appears as described, tie a bandage above and below it, until the pus comes out of that place.
If you do not see it with your eye, treat it by applying remedies to the body, such as ointments and creams that draw out pus like the saliva in the mouth and sweat in the sweat glands.
The fourth book and ninetieth chapter.
In removing the pus.
The pus can differ according to its types and the location on the body where it is found, and this difference is due to the fact that some of them are large and small, and some of them are glassy and transparent, and some of them have three openings and four openings.
And some of them have noses and some of them have mouths, and as for those that are according to the organs that are found in them, they are either two or three, according to whether the organs are organs of the head that are glassy and transparent such as the brain and heart and liver and kidneys and lungs and stomach and pancreas and so on. When pus settles in one of these organs and you see signs of death that I have described to you, it is best to avoid removing it from there, because death will affect the owner of it in the worst of cases. When you do not see these signs of inflammation and the pulse is not rushing in the member's vein, then remove it and treat the wound, and if the sign of the brain is affected, where the bone has been crushed and the skull fracture on the brain, then this will expose severe headache, sweating, and dizziness.
When you do not see these signs of inflammation and the pulse is not rushing in the member's vein, then remove it and treat the wound, and if the sign of the brain is affected, where the bone has been crushed and the skull fracture on the brain, then this will expose severe headache, sweating, and dizziness. Redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, tettery, and confusion of the mind, and sometimes the blood comes out of the ears or nostrils, or perhaps the speech is lost and the sound goes out of its place, with white moisture like egg whites, similar to honey, is done like this.
If these signs appear, do not treat the case of the hemorrhage and remove the pulse if it did not come out, and if the signs of the pulse are that the heart is near the left breast and feels as if it has touched something solid instead of something empty.
Maybe the pulse has a movement similar to the heartbeat, and blood comes out of the wound, followed by coldness in the limbs and shivering, and know that death is near, and the sign of the pulse is if the lung is injured, blood comes out of the wound.
The veins beneath the neck swell and change color, and they breathe deeply and demand cold air. The fact that the hollow of the chest is close to the small ankles and the breathing is intense with severe pain.
The abdominal muscles relax and all the abdominal organs move, and if the pain is severe, the liver follows and blood resembling the color of the liver comes out of the wound, and if the spleen is affected, it is something not related to nourishment.
He ordered a poultice, and if the abdomen swells and something comes out of the wound or scar or abscess that has penetrated, there is no remedy for it and no removal of the poultice, and if the poultice is the substance of the ulcer and the urine comes out.
Something comes out of it and the pain in the neck increases, and know that it is a hemorrhage, and as for the other organs such as the face, the eye, the cheek, the shoulder, the abdomen, the thigh, the leg, and so on, they are lost in the matter.
The splint did not meet with a string or nerve, and the splint was not contaminated, and I tell you some of what I have seen of this splint to indicate its treatment for you, because a splint was found in the eye socket of a man's nose from the beginning of the nose.
The patient was operated on from the opposite side, removing a tumor from the other ear, which had not caused any issues in the eye. Another piece of tumor was removed from the tumor under the lower jaw, which had been wrapped and only the small tip connected to the wooden plate remained.
Another large piece of the composite gallbladder iron was removed, which did not have ears and the eye was clear, no bad incident happened in the eye, and another piece was removed from the Nazarene's hook, which was Arabic.
This is the one with ears, which was split between the vagina and it had gone into his hook, so we removed it kindly until it was taken out by the Nazarene and it was clear, and another piece was removed from a man who had it in his belly and we estimated that he would die from it.
After the period of thirty days or so, nothing changed in his condition, the tumor was split on the piece and it was removed and it was clear, and I saw a man who had a piece in his abdomen and the wound was closed on him.
After seven years, the piece was removed from its original place, and I saw a woman who had a piece in her belly and the wound was closed on it and the piece remained and nothing changed in her condition and she did not find any harm in any of her natural actions.
I observed another man with a piece in his face and closed the wound, but he found little pain, and such was the case for many others, and I extracted pieces from a man of the Sultan's guards who had a piece in the middle of his nose that had reached the left side slightly.
The entire piece disappeared, and I called for treatment after the piece was removed for three days. I found a narrow wound, which I examined with a fine needle, finding nothing but a small crust and pain under the left ear.
I hoped that the crust would be from the piece of the wound, and I closed the site with a bandage of strength and attraction, hoping that the area would heal and show signs of the wound. However, no accident occurred in the area, indicating that the piece had reached the site.
I kept the bandage on it for many days, and no accident occurred in the wound. The pain decreased until I felt the piece inside his nose one day and informed him of the matter. I applied the strong medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened and burst, and I felt the thin piece attached to the cloth. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medicine until the piece appeared in front of us through the surgery, and it stayed with me for about four months.
After expanding the wound and enabling entry into the cellulitis, it attracted and moved it, but it did not respond to exit. I did not cease my efforts to hold it with clamps from the instruments until I caught it on a day with a scalpel, according to its appearance in the last page of the book.
The doctors decided that the patient's nasal gristle would not be stitched, so I stitched it and closed the wound, and healed the wound completely without causing any discomfort to the patient. I will tell you how to remove some sweat to make it an example and evidence of what I did not mention.
These parts and their details are not described by description and cannot be enclosed in a book, but the craftsman measures the little on the much and what was absent is replaced with something new, and a new machine is made at strange nights.
If you fall from this industry, I would say that sweat only exits from the parts that swell in them on two types: either by attraction from the position from which it entered, or against the opposite side, and from where it exits.
Either the cone should be placed in a meaty position to attract and withdraw if it is not necessary to leave it for the time it has passed, it is recommended that you leave it for days until the meat around it becomes soft and facilitates its attraction and withdrawal, and also if an abscess forms in the bone.
But if it is not necessary to leave it for days, you should reinsert it every day by attracting and moving it around the meat from all sides with a gentle hook until the cone expands and attracts and withdraws it.
If the attracting cone is in the bone of the head and has been soaked in one of the brain's cuts, some of those symptoms mentioned to you have appeared, then hold back its attraction and leave it for days until it recovers its action.
Attract and withdraw the cone, if it is attracted greatly and you were not attracting it, use the hooks around the cone as described to you, then treat the area until it is cleared, and if the cone has been soaked in a position of the body. He removed the consciousness and examined it with a spire, if he felt it, he attracted it with some instruments suitable for attracting it, if he couldn't hold onto it due to the narrowness of the wound, the distance from the axis in the gore, and there was no bone, nerve, or flesh.
He divided it until the wound expanded and became firm with the bone, so that he could extract the attached meat from all sides using any method you can, and if you can't extract the meat from the crushed ears and pulled them until it is extracted.
And if you tried to extract the axis, use your finger with a sponge in all directions until it is extracted, and pull it as far as possible without breaking the axis, otherwise it will be difficult for you to attract and extract it from time to time.
Leave it for a few days until the meat around it heals, and then return to it as it is easier when you do not resist bleeding, use the treatment we mentioned in its section, and save your effort from cutting bone, nerve, or flesh and use the instrument.
In any case, you can extract the axis and make it stable and firm as described for you, and it is recommended that you use when attracting the axis that the deformity on the shape of the axis when it was injured is perpendicular.
If you cannot do this, use what you can of the forms, and as for the cone that emerges from the opposite side, it may have something outside of it, or you may find the edge of the cone at the top of the skin nearby and see it coming out.
Divide it into parts as much as possible, then attract it, for it is easier to exit, and if it sticks in the bone, gently place your hand on the handle until the cone affects the bone and expands itself, then attract it.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days to extract it again, and if the return of the cone is possible, pull it out with the device that has been flattened to enter its tension in the socket, then pull it out with it.
If the cone is flattened, pull it out with the device that enters its tension, for the cone will be easier to exit this way, and if the cone is hard, it is best to cut off the fat that has become in it all, if possible, and then treat it according to what is appropriate for that.
If the cone is in the chest, abdomen, navel, or side and is close to what makes you cough with the lever, and you can divide it, then divide it and preserve any fat or nerve and remove it.
Then the incision is made if sutures are needed, and it is treated until it is cleared, resembling the clavicle that attracts the wounds with its strength.
Its ends should resemble the beak of a bird that has swallowed something large, or something small and thin, and it can produce various sizes according to the size of the bone, its thickness, the width of the wound, and its narrowness.

Chapter 50 and 90.
In the chapter of joints.
Joints that are usually cut in the body typically have three joints in the head, eleven in the neck, the two known as the auricles, and two tendons in the chest, and two joints in the eyes, known as the gaze.
The joint in the middle of the gum and the joint in the nose, the turbinates, and the joints in the upper lip, known as the mustache, and the joints in the lower lip, known as the beard, these joints are called the labium.
The excerpt discusses the five bones in the arm and hand, specifically the humerus, which is located on the side with the horns and is commonly known as the skull bone or the middle bone. It is a combination of two parts: one from the Basilisk tribe and another from the horns. It is commonly referred to as the body bone.
The Basilisk tribe is the subject on the inner side and is also known as the shoulder blade. It is commonly referred to as the abdomen and the shoulder bone. It is the object on the wind and is the one that connects to it and is visible above the pubis with a clear appearance and the sacrum.
The bone that is between the thighs and the upper limb has two tribes, and in the thigh and leg, there are three bones: one located below the hip bone on the horns side, another one that is white and its place is at the knee on the inner side, and the third one is the bone of the female genitalia and its place is at the elbow on the horns side.
In the other thigh, there are three bones similar to them, and as for the two ribs that follow the ears, they have the advantage of removing them from the chronic conditions of the nose, the elbow, the wrist, and the receding hairs on the head, and how to remove them according to what was mentioned.
The excerpt translates to: "This is the process of tying the testicle and placing it in the position of the thighs with a fine cut, then tying the testicle's neck with a band so that the testicles are exposed and their positions behind the ears in the lower parts of the head are seen, and they are felt by touching them with your finger, where you feel the pulse under your finger, this is a method of tying the knot.
The excerpt translates to: "Then, a thin needle is taken, which is known as the catheter, and it is inserted under the testicle into the skin until the needle reaches the bone, then your hand is raised with the testicle and the skin over it, and the skin and testicle are cut in a zigzag pattern, with the length of the cuts being twice the length of two fingers.
The excerpt translates to: "Or, you can take out the amount of blood you want and then tie them with gauze and leave them until they are cleaned, and in the first book, the cuts and how to make them are described, and as for the two strings in the chest, their benefit is to prevent the frequent headache, the difficult migraine, the persistent dizziness, and the sudden twitching of the eyes.
The excerpt translates to: "And how to tie them as described, the testicle is pulled up with a band so that the testicles are exposed and their positions behind the ears in the lower parts of the head are seen, and the pulse under your finger is felt, at this time you learn by tying the knot, then raise the skin from the top of the testicle to above with your thumb.
The surgeon enters the wound from below, lifting the skin upwards and spreading it as done in the other wounds, then sends blood from the veins according to your need, then closes the incision with sutures and places one of your fingers on the skin for an hour.
Then, place a cloth and bandage, roll it tightly and leave it until it comes out, and if they mention them and cut them and sew them in the first book, but keep the skin of the wound away from it, as its benefit after removing the bandage is to remove the chronic facial swelling such as the elbow, the bumps, and the redness of the smugglers.
And how to remove it as described, it tightens the elbow with a collar until the skin appears, then take the instrument called the forceps and this is its appearance:
Place the nail of the spring in the head of the forceps on the same skin and beat it with a hammer or something else in that way, then let the blood flow on the side you want, then close the incision and roll it until it comes out.
And it may open wide, but it is not recommended that the knife be sharp like other knives, but it should be slightly narrow and cut on the sides because the bone is close, so if the knife is thin, it may break in it.
Regarding the two types of gases in the eye sockets, their benefit for the eye from experimentation, color, and moisture, and diseases of the face is that they should be removed by making the iris tilt slightly with a small, wide, thin blade. Then, they should be removed while minimizing lengthening.
If the position does not have fat, it is because the blade is too thin and will break, then you send your request to the blood and place a sheet on them and make them wet overnight and dry them, and if you remove the nose mucus, it benefits from the fever.
The severe headache and one of the diseases of the face, such as the chronic red rash that appears in the nose, and how to remove it is to make the iris tilt slightly, then hold the nose with your left hand and take a thin, long blade.
It should be removed in the middle of the turbinate itself between the nose and the nasal bone because the mucus does not show up there, as the blood is revealed at that time, and it is recommended that you slightly touch your hand with the blade and send your request to the blood, then tie it overnight because it will sneeze quickly.
The pharynx is beneficial for its ability to relieve the narrowing of the neck and the beginning of the gangrene and the black plague diseases that appear on the surface of the skin such as the black leprosy, the warts, the rough spots, and the eaters, and how it saves them by raising them under them in the neck with a bandage and the craftsman stands on the head of the pharynx.
The pharynx is placed on a stool, then the blood is drained to a long length with a wide and slight wound, then the blood is drained from the part that needs it, or as needed, then the same is done with another part, and then the bandage is applied.
The two sides of the pharynx are raised to a medium level so that the neck is not burned and left until the next day when it heals the wound, and as for the throat warts, they are beneficial for their removal after the removal of the gangrene because they benefit the jaw, the palate, the rough spots, the eaters, and the swelling of the cheeks.
The warts in the nose and around it, and how to save them by placing the pharynx in front of you and raising your neck with a bandage, then changing the wound and looking at the two sides of the pharynx that you see one on the right side of the wound and the other on the left, and you will clean it from them.
In addition, they have dark veins around them, which are cut in a zigzag manner. If you find it difficult and do not know why, try cutting larger ones and then sew them back together. Do the same for the veins in the lower part of the wound.
As for the veins under the chin, it is beneficial to cut them after cutting the tonsils for treating consumption and other throat diseases, and the method of cutting them is to sit between your hands with the sun shoe on your chin and look under the chin with one hand and the other hand with a dark vein and make it lighter in color.
Cut them and do not be afraid of cutting them, as there are blood vessels under them that may cause bleeding from those vessels. The three veins that are usually cut in the body are the ones that are usually cut on the face and cutting them is done on both sides.
Either they are grafted with a wide Rihani strip or ointment until the hair, and either they are cut with a narrow Sukan strip, which is the nail: This is the image of the wide Rihani strip.
It should be wide as you see to correct the open, swollen, prominent veins that are visible and contain a lot of blood like a nail, and this is the image of the narrow ointment strip:
This is a less invasive and more precise incision, suitable for repairing thin, thin-walled veins that contain thin, pale blood. This is an image of the incision.
This suture is used for stitching and can be of various types depending on the size and narrowness of the veins. It is well-known among surgeons.
And the basilisk, one of these three veins, is beneficial for its stitching as it attracts blood from the thigh and abdomen that flows below the cut and the abdomen, and it is recommended for stitching when stitching it to warn him and be on his neck because if there is a string underneath it, he may mistakenly cut that string.
In case of bleeding, it is recommended not to stitch him with a suture but to cut him with an incision, if the basilisk does not show any clear signs. It is best to avoid it and turn to another one or ask for some of its parts.
Or if you want to stitch his arm, it is clear and can be cut with an incision as we said, if you want to stitch him before tightening the arm, it is best to identify the position until you recognize the position of the pulse, then learn on it with the thread.
The arm is then tied and a notch is cut on the opposite side of the wire, as we have said, to ensure that the strike does not fall in the same position as the cord, and when you see the tendon expand in the position where you taught with the gut, then that expansion is the swelling of the wire and avoid it.
If I saw the blood flowing as it flows from a pig's ear, and the blood was thick and red, I knew that it was from the artery and when I placed my finger on it for a long time, then removed it, the blood stopped almost completely and the shoulder was tightened.
Leave it, and warn the patient of the danger and keep him on his neck without moving for days until he is discharged, because if the blood does not stop and you tighten your grip and do not take medicine at the time, the artery will be cut off if you see that your shoulders are shrinking and the blood stops.
Or take a piece of firm bone and split it in half and take one half and tighten it on the opposite side of the wire, well-tightened with the tendons and the ligaments until another day, because if the blood stops or else treat it as described in the case of the cutting of the tendons for gangrene, and cutting the blood is not difficult in the best of cases.
In small wounds of the arm, the tendon becomes strong, and for the darkest skin, it is beneficial to attract blood from the top of the head to the bottom of the body, as it is a mixture of the Basaraliq and Qifaliq, as we have said.
It is recommended for the graft to be on the neck of the grafted area because there is a nerve underneath, and if it increases in the region of the plastic surgeon, it may cause pain that is difficult to see and possibly did not heal initially. This nerve is often visible during consciousness.
If it is hidden in some people and was thin without knowing where, it is recommended to make the graft of it a scar with the wound and avoid the nerve effort because if the skin is between two nerves, the skin scar is long, and as for the Qifaliq skin, it is beneficial to graft it because it attracts blood from the head.
And it is beneficial for eye diseases, and it is especially good if you graft it in this skin to have scars of the Basaraliq olive oil or the wide Basaraliq Rihana because it closes all the veins because there is no tendon or nerve underneath.
Except that in emergency, it is better to avoid cutting the tendon of the limb and ask for a non-traumatic position, and do not cause harm if the first strike does not cause damage, but may cause inflammation in some people if they did not strike in the first strike.
But it does not cause harm, and the method of cutting and its symptoms and what should be avoided in its treatment is first that one should learn that the cut is used only for preserving health.
And it can be used in diseases and that it is used to preserve health and its stability and to prevent the occurrence of diseases, and it should be cut in one of the three lower legs, which is mentioned in the appendix, namely the knee and the ankle and the elbow, and it should be cut in March if symptoms of swelling appear.
And it should be cut on Sunday or Tuesday after the day has passed for three hours, and the cut that is used in diseases does not have a limited time and is called when needed and necessary from night or day.
And in every hour and in every time, and it is not appropriate for children to be cut until they reach fourteen years old, and it is not appropriate for the elderly who have exceeded sixty years, if one of them is cut for any reason.
It is preferable that the gullet be cleaned before incision by injecting a solution of lint seeds if it contains many hard-to-remove particles, otherwise they may stick to the pharynx during incision causing harm to the major organs, and the incisions should not be made on the wheezers, the sacchi, and the thyme until this is done.
And let the incision also be warned against after the cough, catarrh, backache, and excessive sweating, exertion, and sleeplessness and fasting, and all strength-draining activities either physical or psychological, then look at the anastomoses before that if the blood is thick.
By food, drinks, and medications if possible, then he enters the bath if it does not prevent him or makes him skip some exercise so that his blood is thick and makes the incision in the morning as we said and removes all the psychological impurities of the day from his heart.
Like anger, grief, fear, and all the physical impurities such as fatigue, excessive sweating, backache, and nausea, and prepare for him things that people have used in their habits of using them from the fasts of the month of Ramadan and the months of Muharram and Nabaniyah and so on as much as he can.
The surgeon then places the assistant on a higher stool than that of the patient, then removes his arm and grasps the assistant's hand twice or three times with his own hand, then stretches the tendon with his thumb and pulls it twice or three times, so that the stretching is gentle.
Because if the stretching was not gentle, either due to excessive stretching that prevented blood flow, or to relaxation that also prevented blood flow, then after the stretching, it is recommended that the assistant shake his hand with both hands.
Until the muscles spasm and become visible to the senses, then the assistant should clean the oily hand of the patient with old oil especially, then place the little finger of his left hand on the same spot under the position he wants to hit lightly so as not to cause a blow. Because not all muscles are filled with air like the wrist, and when the assistant places his hand on it, it sinks under his hand, deceives the surgeon, and does not open the muscle, and if it opens, it is only a narrow opening.
Therefore, the assistant should remain calm and composed in all these matters, then the assistant should descend if the opening of the muscle from the stretch is small, or if it is above the position with a quick movement if the position does not allow for a quick movement.
If the swelling or wound of the heel is left for a day or two, and the tendon is not tightened, it may cause a hot swelling that does not enter the bath. Then, the fester may repeat if desired, as long as the incision was made small and the bleeding was thin.
I was afraid that the blood would not all come out, so I reopened the incision in the same socket and gently pushed it against the healing tissue in the wound opening, a little bit, before the area swells. In many people, the area may swell at the small opening.
If you see that it has swollen, do not tie it again as it does not serve any purpose and there is nothing to put on it like oil of unguent, as it facilitates the bleeding and it is better in this case than the oil itself and other oils and also.
Use oil of unguent on all the wounds of your throat when the bleeding is difficult and may be done by applying either the ointment or the plaster on the site, as the blood will run and drip if it is rough.
If a large swelling occurs in the wound of the healing or especially for those who have not been incised before, or if the opening of the throat is small, apply a poultice of resinous ointment mixed with water and a little salt on the swelling and leave it for an hour, as it will drain.
When it comes to removing blood from its own color or from another, if there remains in the position after a few days of whiteness or greenish color, it will not harm it, so if you like, carry something patient and local mucus on it.
Or something from the gum of the poppy and similar, and often happens inflammation and swelling when removing the nails, if you find it on your hand, it will subside when pressing it against your toe if it is swelling on your toe then that is bad do not put anything on it that we mentioned.
For it may be bleeding from the thread blood but closed it with something to fasten the position then treat it with other treatment until it comes out, and it is recommended that every person takes out of the blood according to his strength and what appears on the color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it come out until it turns red, and if it is thick, send it until it becomes thin, and if it is severe, let it pass until its end, and it is recommended for those who are full and need to remove the blood once.
To widen the removal of the color and make the scraper wide, and if it is weak, it is recommended to fight against it and take it out in stages and make the nail narrow, and the best that can be used for removing the color is a sharp, round, and without thorns.
This is a surgical procedure for varicose veins, known as striking the knot, which is performed by Ahmed and Aslam. It involves incising the vein horizontally and longitudinally. If the patient is used to standing during varicose vein surgery, it is recommended to feed them something like bread soaked in warm rice vinegar or sugar syrup before the procedure.
If the patient has fainted three times or four, they are considered a depressed person. Before surgery, they should drink something like bread soaked in wine, grape juice with anise, or a healthy beverage like Rhubarb tea.
If syncope occurs during surgery, and the cause is excessive bleeding, it is recommended that the patient drinks lamb broth and a weak Rhubarb tea, applies the ointment containing gallic acid to their chest with it, and uses other items mentioned in the division for treating syncope.
If the patient is experiencing anxiety, and someone wants to relax their arm and remove some blood, it is recommended for those who undergo frequent varicose vein surgery with weak strength that they slowly remove a little blood over time.
If the patient wants to relax their arm and remove some blood, and their body is strong, they should do it seven hours or eight days after the first surgery. If the patient wants to draw blood from the opposite side of the body that was affected, they should go to them on the second or third day.
From the body, if the person has a lot of blood that is hot and has been created, it is recommended to remove it all at once and remove the large amount of blood and expand the opening so that the gushing stops after it has been independent of all conditions for bleeding. And if you place your hand on the pulse while bleeding, do not allow death to occur at the site of the gushing, as it is often exposed when ignorance of the wound occurs and the mistake is made, and it is not recommended if you want to amputate the arm and let the blood flow again.
And the throat has closed and made it difficult to remove the blood from it with great force or to squeeze it with strength, as that is very undesirable either to leave it until it dries up again or to pull it out with the tip of the razor without freezing the blood in the throat.
Or carry something salty that has dissolved in the water or carry something acidic or corrosive and squeeze it gently until the blood comes out, if the throat has been burned, leave it alone.
Do not touch it until the tumor is healed, as the need to let the blood flow again is necessary and either to dry it up above that position or to dry it up in the other arm or in the other throat.
In the case of amputating a finger, an artificial finger is substituted from the elbow or knee, if neither is available, or if they are concealed, as it is composed of both. The method of amputation is to insert the finger into hot water until it turns red and appears with a clear color, then raise it above it with a thread, slightly swollen, in the middle.
Then, the color is applied to a slight kneading, without width or length, so that the opening is wide and it becomes your amputation for the distal end of the hand, little by little, if the removal of blood is difficult, then the hand is placed in the basin with hot water and let the blood flow in the water.
Until your need is met, if you are in summer days, you may stop putting the hand in hot water and more so that the blood flows in hot water during winter, and this color is sealed from all colors. Because there is no poisonous color or nerve under it, and if you amputate the little finger from the hand, it is beneficial for the liver and the method of amputation is to raise the thumb or your hand above it after inserting it in hot water until it turns red.
Because there is no poisonous color or nerve under it, and if you amputate the little finger from the hand, it is beneficial for the liver and the method of amputation is to raise the thumb or your hand above it after inserting it in hot water until it turns red. The hand clearly perceives it greatly, then separates it slightly and does not harm it in any way, even if the entire body is exposed to fire, as the hand's nerve is located within the meat, and then returns the hand to hot water.
Let it bleed in it, if you do not return it to hot water, the blood will freeze in the mouth of the ox and stop flowing, if you withdraw the blood in the necessary amount, place it on the ox dung and salt, otherwise it will quickly burn.
And it is also advisable to do the same with every thin piece, and as for the benefit, it saves the hand from the left hand, as it is beneficial for the gout and the same applies when saving it as you did in the second, whether it saves the hips, its benefit for the diseases that are at the bottom of the body such as gout.
And dressing the thistle and diseases of the kidneys, chronic cystitis and gout in the toes and ankles, and other diseases from it, how to save it so that the man's leg enters hot water with the foot holding it until the quinsy rises, then raises the leg above the knee joint with the ox dung, and the position of the leg is towards the thighs.
A large number of warts appear on the man's face, they are best and most suitable to be removed from the face of the man, as removing them from the face of the man preserves the nerves beneath it on the face of the man.
Make the excision of it as if you want to cut off the tail, and make the surgeon's hand clean, as removing the blood from it is difficult, so leave it in hot water until it is empty, and if the surgeon makes a mistake in the color of the wart in the first attempt.
If the excision is made slightly above, as the position is broken, there is no fear of it being a vacuum, and as we said, this should also be done with the woman's breasts, and as for the color of the man's skin, it is as we said from the side that is wild.
The benefit of excising it is to relieve the warts if it is done before the hot blood, and the way of excising it is to enter the bath and hurry and lift the leg from the root of the wart to the top of the chest with four fingers of a long thin glove, as it will not be visible except in this way.
If it appears to excise it in any case, whether it is done by cutting and it is best, or if you remove it by cutting or leave it as it is, and the position is broken, and it is among the most people who are known to be hidden a lot, then you will not find it.
Nothing has been shown for the sensitive part, but some of its parts have been preserved and sent from the veins towards the knees and toes, and they preserve the nerves.
Then, the wound was cleaned and a piece of cloth was placed on it, and the wound was quickly cleaned.
The 108th section.
In the hammer and its method of use.
The hammer may be made of wood, boxwood, boxwood, or glass, and the hammer has two faces: one with a hammer to extract blood and the other without.
And this hammer, without a condition, has two faces.
And the hammers of the surgeons and they are both sides of the neck, and the hammers of the knife and it is below the lower jaw, and the hammers of the knees, and the hammers of the elbows, and the hammers of the ankles, and the hammers of the fingers.
The excerpt translates to: "The ligature attracts blood from the moist, spongy veins in the flesh and for this reason, it should not be used to tie off the artery or any other part of the body. Neither fire nor non-fire should be used in the ligature for any disease that is caused by excess until the entire body is emptied.
The excerpt translates to: "Indeed, the need for the ligature arises from a disease or usually, it is used in every case at the beginning of the month and at its end, and in the middle, and in any other time that it may be needed.
The excerpt translates to: "And that is why, when there is an excess of blood in the body and it needs to be removed by ligature, they find a weight in their head, a swelling in their neck, and some of them find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck, and others find blotches in their face and neck, redness in their eyes, and distortion in their ears, and they have a sense of the position of the ligature.
The excerpt translates to: "And among them are those who laugh more and those who find the taste of blood in their mouth, swallow it, and the blood oozes out, and those who sleep more and those who see in their sleep the blood, the redness, the wounds, and the surgeries, and similar things, when did we see anything like that?
In particular, if in the middle of the month we order the hijamah after two or three hours of daylight, and the benefit of hijamah of the nose is that it benefits the weight of the head and water that flows to the eyes.
However, it should be done after cleansing the body and this hijamah may be an alternative to prevent fainting and warns not to use it if the patient has a cold or has a chill as it can cause great harm.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly and those with cold-related diseases in their head, and by women who have forgotten something on them.
Therefore, it should be ordered that the hijamah operator pours his hand slightly with the hijamah tool fearing the birth of forgetfulness, and the hijamah of the ear is an alternative to prevent fainting and prevent dizziness.
Therefore, it benefits from respiration and constriction of the chest, and the act of inhaling and vomiting, and it is recommended to raise the hijamah of the ear slightly because if it is directed downwards and causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
And the hijamah of the temples benefits from the sudden pain in the head, neck, chest, abdomen, and back, and it is an alternative to prevent dizziness. It is recommended that the hijamah operator does not dip his hand in the thread lest he cuts a vein during the bleeding.
As for the gargle under the chin, it benefits the throat and clears the neck and its surroundings from various diseases in the mouth. It also prevents the growth of gangrene in the shins, and as for the gargles for the shoulders, they benefit from the swelling and heat that is caused by excess.
As for the gargle for the belly of the wind, it benefits what benefits the three windpipes: the bronchus, the trachea, and the trachea. This is because it attracts blood from all those rheumy bronchi in the meat and attracts those bronchi from other more severe ones until the attraction reaches the three thin bronchi.
It is recommended that the gargle be ordered not to cause harm because the position is exposed from the meat and beneath it are nerves and blood vessels, and as for the single gargle that gargles on the teeth, it benefits from the surrounding areas of the seat and the heels of the below.
It is recommended that the gargle be ordered to be large and made of flint because the position requires a strong pressure, and perhaps the gargle of the thighs will break the glass and there is a heavy condition, and as for the gargles for the thighs, they reduce excess in a clear way.
It attracts blood from all the body and benefits chronic pains in the kidneys, bladder, and gallbladder, relieves constipation, helps with cough and asthma, and prevents sprains and dislocations, except that it harms the body a lot and causes swelling in more people, and the support of the ankles' swellings is close to the benefit of tightening the thighs.
The method of applying the splint is to first put it on empty, then moisten a moderate amount, not long, and quickly place and remove the splint, so that the pins arrive at the position in a steady manner, and continue repeating this until you see the position has turned red and opened.
A redness of blood is required at that time, and the moisture is applied repeatedly until the body is examined. If a person among the people has a fat neck that is flexible, it is better to insist on one alone, otherwise it will not straighten the position.
The splint orders that the pin should expand, slightly deepen, and adjust the moisture in a gentle way, and if there is too much blood in the vein, it is better to insist twice, once to open the path for the gentle exit of the blood, and the second time to remove the excess blood.
In case the blood is thick, we repeat the operation three times to achieve the desired result, and by all means if we want to extract a small amount of blood, we can do so with one single requirement, but if we want to extract a large amount of blood, we need more requirements, and we estimate that the blood is thick.
It is preferable to use a deep requirement and a moderate limit for the depth of the skin, not what should be used from the tweezers when placing the clamps and not what warns the clamp, but if his skin was thick, hard, rough, and narrow.
It is preferable to clean the tweezer areas with a disinfected, broad-headed tweezer, but if it is in summer, like olive oil or ointment of benzoin or ginger oil or honey of poppy, or sugar oil.
And if it is in winter, like resin or oil of sassafras or oil of camphor or cinnamon, or such, and the advantage is cold and hard, then the oil should be oil of myrrh or oil of nutmeg or oil of clove or such.
If the tweezer is broad-headed, it cuts meat, then the oil should not be of these, and they should wash their tweezers after plucking with rose water or cold water or water of the antelope's head or water of the deer or water of the ram and such. And if his blood is moist.
In cleaning the ears, either with water or alcohol and vinegar, and if they are very dirty, clean them with old wine or vinegar of mahmari or with the juice of the poppy seed or with the juice of the poppy seed and the juice of the ginger, and it is recommended to avoid touching the ears with the hair after washing.
Indeed, it is recommended to use after leaving the bath for an hour or two, and it is not recommended that one sleeps after cleaning the ears, and what is recommended is that the mug and the mug be rubbed before cleaning and after it.
It is necessary to look first, whether the mug or the mug is empty and the most common is that the blood and inflammation are low, it is recommended that he takes the drinks such as rhubarb and hindbaits with water and sugar and vinegar and ginger and makes his food the Firarij and meat of the liver and spices and nuts and nuts and nuts and nuts and nuts.
And if his mood is cold, it is recommended that he drinks the honey and the honey of Mib and the clean sugar and drinks the middle aromatic tea between old and new and makes his food the Firarij and the spices and the saffron and the cilantro and the soap for bathing is added to it, and it is recommended that the drink be on the day of cleaning and washing more than the food.
It is sometimes advisable for some people to take the purgative, or the opium and digitalis, before the clyster or the enema, or afterward to strengthen the principal members and to cleanse the blood, and it should not be given by the unskilled.
And the unbound enemata are those that are placed on the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and on the abdomen and uterus, and on the flanks and sides, for the purpose of drawing the blood from one organ to another.
When we place the enemata on the spleen in a cathartic or when we use them to draw cold air over the organ, it is because they have been placed on the abdomen and uterus, for they heat and inflame the organ and cause pain, that is, this cold air.
And if a stopper is placed on the kidneys, or a douche is applied to them, it may open the stopper or close the douche from its place, and the same thing happens when enemata are placed on the liver and spleen when cold air is applied to them, these enemata are used only with empty stomachs.
You can use fire and it can be filled with pure water for the purpose of cauterization, because it fills the cautery and becomes large with hot water alone or with some foods that are suitable for this purpose.
Then it is placed on the spot and held in place and is reheated as needed, and this is the appearance of the cautery that is used with fire: .
Its mouth should have two openings on the side as we have depicted and a depth of about half a grain, and there should be a small hook on one side of it that is inserted into the chisel made of Chinese brass or black brass with a rough edge.
The cauterizing substance should be flat and woven so as not to harm the organ when placed on it, and there should be a copper or iron pin in the middle with the cautery where the turmeric is burned, and this cautery can be large or small according to the disease.
And if we use it, the cautery for children and animals is not suitable for men and old people, and the way to put this cautery on fire on the member is to heat a small amount of turmeric or powdered saffron and place it in the middle of the tightened ring that is in the center of the cautery.
Ascend the flame towards the bottom of the mold, lest it burns the body of the model, then place it on the digit and the nail that we mentioned until if we hold the mold, what we remove the digit, the nail is removed.
The water came out on that nail, and the mold melted on the surface, then the fitter placed it back on the scale if it was burnt from there, as for the mold used in the disease of gout in water, it does not have a fixed pin and a nail.
But rather, it is used by filling with water and placing on the digit only, and this is its appearance:
And this mold was large when it was full of water, as much as it could hold, it was better.
The seventh and eightieth chapter.
In the comment to the comment.
The comment is that it is used in more cases in the organs in which it is not possible to place the molds, either because they are small like the nail and the toe and similar parts, or because the organ is fatty from the meat like the digit and the nose and similar parts.
And the method of using it is to take the wet, alkaline water from the suds and leave it in the wet water for a day and night until it swells and nothing remains in its depth. The body is first freed from the cast or bandage, then the affected part is cleaned.
The wound is then cleaned and dressed with a piece of cloth, if possible, with the aid of a splint. If not, the wound is washed with cold water, allowed to dry, and dried again, if the blood flow stopped after the fall and it was due to a contusion.
The dressing is then placed on top until the bleeding stops, if a lot of blood comes out, apply a poultice, ointment, or a similar substance until the bleeding stops or place it on the wound so that half of the sharp edges are covered.
The dressing is left until the wound sticks to its place, if the bleeding stops, it is recommended to rebandage, but do not rebandage if possible, if the bandage does not stick, wash the wound with vinegar.
Or use a probe in the wound until something comes out of the blood, then place it if you feel something from the blood on the ground, if you want it to fall off, put something on it such as vinegar, salt, or pus, it will fall on the ground.
The Third Chapter.
In arithmetic.
This chapter deals with arithmetic necessary for surgery, specifically fractures and unusual deformities in bones.
Inform yourselves, O sons of the doctors and common people, that this chapter may be called the rudiments of surgery by those who have not read a single book on the subject or even a single letter of it.
This chapter has made surgery a neglected science in our country, and I have not seen anyone who has improved upon it. I derived benefit from this chapter only in extending my reading of the early books and striving to understand them, after which I extracted the knowledge from them. Then I had to undergo practice and experience throughout my life.
I have drawn for you in this chapter all that is related to my knowledge. I followed up my experience with this chapter after bringing it close to you and completing it from the art of fractures, condensing it from the condensed, clarifying it from the clarified, and picturing for you in it many images of the machines used in it.
This is how I increased the explanation in the advanced chapters, and there is no power except with God the great.
The first chapter.
In this section, we will discuss the methods of breaking bones and their presentation before discussing the broken and amputated organs one by one. It is advisable to mention the main points and sections in this chapter. First, you must understand and stand on the reality that this is a noble craft that you and others have been seeking to learn.
When a bone is broken, amputated, or cut, it is advisable to quickly remove or bandage it, or all of them. However, if it is not prevented by a contraindication such as weakness or something like that happened to him was something like childhood or elderly, or the time was very cold or very cold, then.
Then, he should limit his diet to cold foods and bird meat, avoid alcohol and fatty meat, and avoid eating too much food until the tumor is cured and no adverse reactions occur to the surrounding material.
Therefore, the patient should return to the first treatment that was applied, and if the broken bone is extracted, it is advisable for the patient to eat foods that are rich in nutritious foods such as heads, rice, brains, and hooves, like goat heads and knees. Eggs and fish, and strong drinks, and similar substances, if used in this manner, accelerate bone fracture healing, and know that broken bones in old men and the elderly cannot connect and coalesce with their original nature ever.
For the bones of the legs and their strength, and they may connect and coalesce with their original nature as that of children's bones, but the nature rises on the broken bone from all sides, like a tooth that is pulled out and causes it to become loose and strong until some parts require support from others.
And they connect with each other until they reach maximum strength and stability, just as it was originally, until nothing can obstruct its action.
Therefore, it is necessary for the patient's diet to include foods that are strong, rigid, and astringent, as we have mentioned, and know that bone fractures differ according to the difference in the parts involved because a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the arm bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the spine bone.
Also, all other parts are different from each other in their fractures, and we will mention each type of fracture separately, and the type of bone fracture may also differ within itself.
The excerpt translates to: "For if it is a fracture without wounds, it may be a long bone fracture with wounds and non-wounds, and it may not have wounds. The fracture is accompanied by a cut and a gash in the skin, and it is a slow cracking sound.
The excerpt translates to: "For each type of fracture, there is a specific method for it, as will be explained in its place, and what is recognized as a bone fracture is its appearance, its color, and its appearance when touched, and its trembling when you press it with your hand.
The excerpt translates to: "If there was no appearance of color, trembling, or trembling when you press the bone in its place without much pain and without finding much pain, it is not a fracture but a sprain or a twist here, or a slow cracking sound, so it should not be moved with strong and painful rubbing.
The excerpt translates to: "But it carries with it the drugs that are mentioned after the position is agreed upon, and it becomes firm but gentle, and know that if the bone fractures and cracks without wounds, it means that all parts of it have separated from each other.
It is advisable for you to begin straightaway to bandage and align the wound before it becomes inflamed, for if it becomes inflamed, leave it for days until the hot wound subsides, then dress it with whatever you consider suitable from kindness and consideration.
Understand that bandaging and aligning it is easier than bone, which has developed holes in it, then it will become apparent what should be done about it, for if the bone has holes in it, then the broken limb must be amputated from both sides, either the hand or the foot.
Either with your hand if the limb is small, or with a rope and either with the rope and your hand, and place the limb in its natural position until the bone protrusion extends, then cut off those wounds at their places with whatever you consider suitable from kindness and consideration.
Strive to ensure that you do not cause harm to the patient through your actions and avoid causing him pain or injury, and try to hold onto one of the bones with the other hand in the best position possible, for at that time it is advisable to touch and examine them with your hand, and if you see anything wrong, correct it and align it with your strength.
Be cautious of the sharp and powerful pain, as many ignorant people experience it often due to their actions. They may cause a wound or damage to the organ, as I have witnessed repeatedly from their actions.
Then, after settling and strengthening the wound, keep the organ quiet and still, warning the patient not to move it during wakefulness, sleep, change of position, or disturbance, and when they stretch or move it, to avoid causing further pain.
And that when they feel pain or discomfort in the wound of the organ, they should not transfer it to a different position than the one they are comfortable with, and they should be aware that the displacement causes a stable and even pain.
So that no inflammation occurs in the wound if it is manipulated, and as for how to strengthen the broken organ, I have described it earlier, know that the broken bones differ in size, weight, and shape. Some of them are small like the arm and finger.
It is best that the edges of the fracture be firm and not inflamed, as the wide ligament supports the large bone and strengthens it evenly on both sides, without causing any weakness.
Then continue after your pause to carry the appropriate paint for that. Then, apply the bandage on the wound position three or four times according to the organ's deserving, slightly tighten your hand with the bandage, and then carry it to the upper side of the wound position.
Then, slightly reduce your hand's tightness from the wounded position, then slightly spread the bandage away from the wound position, until you take something good from the correct position, then take another ring and wrap it on the wounded position as well.
Then, wrap the bandage to the lower side of the wound, and make sure your action is in the hand's tightness and stretching on what we mentioned in the first upper bandage, then place between the bandages of the incision or fracture whatever balances the wound's swelling.
If there is swelling, do not put anything on it, then wrap another ring on it, then tighten on these measured rough edges of your time if there is no wind or heat in the organ.
If there is wind or heat, hold it with what contains that tumor and goes with the wind, then leave it for a few days, and then tighten on it at that time, so the edges are half of the inscribed arch that is wisely cut or the edges are made of Gharbili wood.
The excerpt discusses the creation of surgical instruments from materials like paper, wheat straw, or reed, and their use in various procedures. It emphasizes the importance of proper sizing for each instrument and its specific shape.
However, the instrument placed on the fracture site should be slightly larger and more exposed than others, with its length determined according to the size of the fractured bone. The image shows the surgical instrument.
Then, apply the instruments according to their first tension, and then tie them from above with fine threads according to what we mentioned regarding tension, which is that the tension should be greater at the fracture site. And as you move away from the fracture, the tension was lower.
It is recommended that the threads be medium in thickness and length, and preferably made of damp cloth, especially since if the threads are too thin, as I have seen with the jaws of the forceps, they make them from the broken cloth strips, which is a great mistake.
This is because the tension is outside the balance and the rinsed threads are not suitable because you do not reach the desired tension with them, and it is not recommended to be between the instruments and the instruments less than a finger.
If the wound is on the shoulder after a fracture in the correct position, place a soft cloth or silk under it to prevent further irritation. However, if the fracture is accompanied by a wound and a break in the skin, we will address this separately.
Understand that not all broken bones should be treated with shoulder pressure from the first day, as the bone may be large and it is not recommended to place the shoulder on it for more than five days, or seven, or more according to your comfort to avoid the formation of a hard tumor.
This is the type of bandage that was forced on those who had fractures, dislocations, and sprains, an annual short bandage that forces the fracture to heal and corrects more joints, especially in children and women because it does not allow for cold or heat.
It is to take from the dust of the rhubarb and the door of the rhubarb that sticks to the rhubarb when it is moved during the drying, to shake it as if it were not but to wash it with egg whites and make it neither rough nor thin, then to spread it.
Another type of bandage is required for fractures and amputations, made from hides, leather, waste materials, rags, and twine, each weighing ten dirhams and a month's labor, with a total of forty dirhams. From clay, twenty dirhams are needed. All should mix this bandage with water or egg whites if the wound is putrid, and then use it as the bandage as it promotes bone healing quickly and is more suitable for most people for replacement.
Another type of bandage that is beneficial for fractures and amputations, made from hides, leather, waste materials, rags, and twine, each weighing ten dirhams and a month's labor, with a total of forty dirhams. From clay, twenty dirhams are needed. All should mix this bandage with water or egg whites, making it gentle and wetting it with either water or egg whites. Then use it.
Bandage for the joints and bones of their places, to contain the pain of them and to soothe the bones and fractures, a poultice made from ground herbs is applied to the affected area, wrapped in cloth, and placed on the spot. This bandage does not have strength to heal.
He is proficient in treating burning tumors and relieving pain, especially, a bandage of another type that forces the broken bone, taking ginger paper and fine linen paper and stitching them all together with wet ones, a short bandage of another type used for drawing out the crack in the bone.
You want to analyze the base of the tumor, taking from the gutta-percha and baboon's fat, nutmeg from each part, grinding all of them together with paint if the organ is not decayed, and if it is decayed, grinding it with water of sumac or water and using it.
A stronger bandage for analysis than this first one is used when a hard tumor occurs during bone drawing, taking from the gutta-percha and the root of the turmeric, the basil leaf, the poppy seed, nutmeg from each part, and baboon's fat and gutta-percha from each part.
The materials are all ground and moistened with water of sumac or bitter water or paint according to the temperature and soundness of the organ, and as for boiling, it is not mentioned in his book that it should be placed on the broken bone during setting.
Except for the mustard seed and oil, which is not, it is described as being between the swelling and the rigidity, and as for Galen, he saw that things like shoes should be placed on the broken bone when it is being set, such as things containing mustard seeds along with something of heat like mercury, brimstone, and glycerin, as we have mentioned.
Description of the mustard poultice that relieves pain and swelling, it is taken with magot, gauze, human hair or bird's nest, and salt, which is applied to the affected area and makes it red and inflamed, and as for the amount that should remain in the bandage.
Then it should be left as it is, because if there is no swelling or movement of the broken bone from its position, it should not be left for many days, because if it happens in the position, it will cause severe pain or anxiety or spasm.
Therefore, it should be left at the right time and do not delay the application of the poultice, then take a warm wet spoonful or splint and immerse it in the cold water and clean the area until the swelling disappears and the pain disappears, then leave the patient to rest for an hour.
Then place the warm powdered plaster on the affected area and grease it with ointment or rose oil, and secure it overnight so that the tumor becomes firm and the organ's convulsion subsides, then return it to its original soft and gentle swelling. Do not make it too hard.
And rub it until it comes out, because I saw that the tumor, the redness, the pain, the convulsion, and all the symptoms have truly disappeared and returned to the soft and hard swelling, so reapply it as you did first, whether or not there is anything else in the organ.
Do not reapply it for more than three days, or four, or five, or seven, and it may leave it for twenty days according to the condition of the organ as we said until the fracture is necessary and approaches the meat on it.
Also increase it more in hardness than the first one, and also increase it in sharpening the food of the borer as mentioned, because I saw that the position of the fracture is broken and swollen more than it should be, so know that the food is unable to reach it.
Then apply the cold water every time you apply it, and do this every three days to reduce the hardness slightly, for in this way the food reaches the organ and quickly removes it, and what the blind make of the cooks is breaking the organ another time.
If he does not first perform the necessary operation and then performs an unnecessary one, he is wrong in his action and has committed a grave error, even if it were correct, it should have been mentioned in their earlier works and practiced by them, and I did not see any effect of dispute from any of them in this regard. The correctness is that he should not do it.
The second part.
In the fracture of the depressed part of the head.
Types of depressed fractures of the head are many and their forms are diverse and causes are varied, some fractures may be from a sword blow and it may be that the bone is completely shattered or it may end in the splinter under the bone. Just as the stitching is done in the cloth.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a splintered fracture, and it may be that some bones are cut with a sword and left open but not extended to the end, and this type of fracture is called an open fracture, and the wound in these fractures may be large or small.
And there is a fracture that is shattered or broken, and its cause is a blow with a stone or falling on a stone or similar, and this fracture is either open and approaches the pericranium under the bone or it is inside the bone.
This wound of these fractures can also be large or small, and from the break what is hidden in the bone in the hair follicle is a slow protrusion.
Therefore, this type of wound is called hairy, and from it a fracture can be a fall or a stone fragment that enters the bone surface and becomes a situation as if it were exposed like the handle of a sword if it hits it with a blow part of it enters inside.
And more, this is more common in the soft skull bone of children, and all these kinds of fractures may have visible and invisible edges, and we will mention all these types of fractures by their position, and we will identify all these types of fractures by exposure to them.
And they examine them with forceps and remove the decayed meat from it, and as for the hairy type, it is known that it exposes the bone and cleans and smears it with gut, and if the fracture is black, then the treatment of the fracture is to first look at the symptoms of the wound.
And I saw among its symptoms what indicates fear such as trembling of the limbs, extension, loss of consciousness, cutting off the sound, closing of the eyes, rapid breathing and redness of the eyes, and other symptoms like this, do not approach the wound or treat it because death is inevitable with these symptoms in the most cases.
When I see symptoms that do not cause alarm and seek safety, then I treat them because if the wound reaches the bone in the first place it is cut, that was during the winter months.
It is preferred to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, regardless of the case, and if it is in the summer, it is preferred to remove the bone before the seventh day to prevent the soft tissue under the bone from deteriorating and exposing the symptoms we described.
If the bone is broken through the soft tissue covering the brain and has a sharp edge with hair, it is preferred to cut off the part that is inflamed and described as follows, which is to cut off the wound of the incised patient.
And reveal the bone according to which side you can access and according to the shape of the wound and what is hidden on the patient, if the exposure of the bone causes bleeding or hot swelling, it is preferred to do as follows.
And it is to cover the wound with a wide incision in the abdomen and ointment and close the wound until the tumor settles and stops the bleeding, then to grasp and extract the bone and that is done on one side of the patient.
For the single face, it is that you should cut the bone with a narrow, smooth incision, and this is its appearance:
Then, you should use another incision after this one, revealing a little of it, and this is its appearance:
Then, you should also use another incision, revealing more of it, and there should be several incisions different from each other, some longer than others, and all of them should be sharp and well-made, either from Hindu steel or good glass.
And use the hammer on the incision so as not to shake the head and hurt it, for if the bone is strong and hard, it is better to encircle it before using the chisels with the non-lancet chisels that they call lancet chisels.
For the chisel does not exceed the thickness of the cheek bone beyond it, so that the chisel has a smooth edge almost like a screw or a small circle that prevents it from piercing and going through the bone.
And it is recommended that you take several chisels, one for each thickness of the bone until it prepares for you a chisel with a sharp edge equal to the length and breadth of the cheek, and this is a picture of three types. From the instruments, large, medium, and small.
And how to thrust the probe around a fractured bone is to place the probe on the bone and move it with your fingers until you learn that the bone has been passed and then move the probe to another position, and between each thrust make sure the force is enough or close to it.
Then, cut between the two probes and do this as much as you can manage with your grip, as we said until the bone is either in your hand or another object from among the tools I have mentioned for this purpose.
Like the forceps and the claw, and it is advisable that you take all precautions not to break the probe or the cut piece, for if you have bent the bone and separated it from the clasp if it is attached to it and has been pulled out then it is recommended that you discard it.
And smooth out the remaining roughness in the bone with another tool that is similar to the cut piece but it should be finer and more comfortable than other probes, if there are some small bones or fragments left you take them with the tools you have.
Then, treat the wound after that with the scalpel and the retractor that is mentioned, and the other side of the operation is a smooth one to avoid confusion from the surgery mentioned by Galen and praised by Maneo, this is what he said. It is recommended to first expose a part of the bone from the site where the fracture is most severe, until you expose that part and under it, there appears a hinge of this eyeball and here is its image:
The eyeball part should be smooth and not cut anything, the sharp part of it is on its edges in the long direction as you see, the eyeball part is attached to the shaft and the face of the sharp part of the bone section, then strike the section from one side.
Using a small scalpel until all the bone is cut in the same direction and you are safe from the cover, no unfortunate accident occurs, even if the surgeon is less experienced and makes them, yes, even if they are negligent.
If something remains necessary for the bone from some parts of the bone, remove it from it with the same hinge of the eyeball section and remove it from there, as it will be removed without any harm or fear.
And if the fracture of the bone did not reach the cover and the part that was cut from the bone had white and inflamed spots left in it, it is recommended to remove those spots and lift the inflamed spots by scraping them with a smooth edge that has been made from different ingredients so that you can use it in all its positions and correct it according to what guides you in the work.
The broken bone and its shape, and it is recommended that you use in your first operation on the bone to expose those parts then use sharper than it and still do that on loyalty until you reach the use of sharper and more refined of all.
And the small hair-like fractures and fine cracks, it is recommended that you use in each treatment according to what leads to safety and this is something that is not hidden from those who have this trade lowest degree and stop on what we wrote and explained in the large fractures.
And if the dressing remains broken at the joint of the bone, it is recommended that you take a small crack on the size of the wound and dip it in oil and perfume and place it on the mouth of the wound then take another small crack thin or mixed. And dip it in a drink and oil and perfume and place it on the first crack and make that with what you can afford so as not to burden the bandage then use from above a wide ribbon and do not stretch it more than what holds the wound only.
And this treatment day or two until the tumor becomes soft then remove it and use after that the drugs that are with it prefer those like sodium sulfate and potassium carbonate and potassium carbonate and zirconium and such and it is that you make from these drugs pins.
Keep the wound clean and use medicine that will not cause it to seep or ooze, and make sure your efforts in treating the wound are not harmful and do not cause the metal to corrode, and do not let the rust accumulate in it.
Because if the iron comes into contact with the brain covering, it will corrupt and damage it, and this can happen on a large scale on the skull, especially if the wound is neglected.
And if the wound is not treated, it will be a serious problem, and if the sweat is only due to the medicine applied and that medicine was strong enough to cause it.
It is recommended to mix three parts of honey with three parts of rose oil, beat them well, and sprinkle them on the covering, and then apply any appropriate treatment until it is cleared.
The third part.
If the nose breaks, it must be set.
Understand that the nose only breaks if both of its upper parts are broken, or one of them for it is bones because the lower part of it has a layer of flesh that does not break and it only shows signs of pain, anger, and frustration.
When a part of the nostril is broken, it is recommended to insert the little finger into the nasal conch and mend the break from inside, using your thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape and you should do this carefully to avoid causing more harm to the afflicted area.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger did not reach it, it should be mended with the little finger, pressing lightly there. If the fracture is on both sides, do the same, and start mending it on the first day of the fracture.
If it is possible and not later than the seventh or tenth day after the swelling subsides, then insert your little finger into the nasal conch and make two incisions if the fracture is in one direction, or make one incision if it is in both directions.
The incision should be made with a slight pressure on the nasal conch, and some early surgeons advised to grease the incision daily and change it in milk with eggs yolks added, but I have not seen that and it is recommended to grease the incision with egg whites mixed with vinegar.
Then leave the incision until the bone is set and the edges are callused, and you can insert the incision tube into the nose after cleaning it with Rizh oil and a crack in it to make it more suitable for fracturing the nose and preventing the patient from breathing.
Do not consider this unnecessary if you wish to make the nostrils, for heat applied through your work will close the nostril with gauze or a piece of cloth moistened with oil or something from the eyelid.
If you do not wish to close the nostril, it is best to apply heat externally with fine charcoal and a sharp kundra that has been dried, then place a wet gauze on top and do not tie the nose with anything from the beak, for if the bones of the nose break, they will break into small pieces.
Or if they break, it is best to cut them off and remove them with the appropriate instrument, then clean and treat the wound with the suitable ointment from the herbs that correspond to this, for if there is an injury inside the nose, it is best to treat it with a nail and use silver tubes. Until it is clean.
The fourth chapter.
It is necessary to break the lower part of the nose.
If the lower part of the nose breaks and it is not broken with an injury, then if it breaks from the outside and does not break twice and falls inward, its knowledge facilitates.
When the fracture is in the left hand, insert the little finger of the right hand into the palm of the patient and also when the fracture is in the right hand, insert the little finger of the left hand into the palm of the patient to lift the fractured part from inside to outside.
The other hand is controlled from outside the bone, if the fracture of the cheekbone is reduced by two then it is recommended to use the force of both hands on stability until the reduction is possible, if it has happened in the teeth it will grow.
Or if the fracture is separated, take out the gold or silver or iron wire and put it on the broken end of the finger, then put a large flat clamp on the break and put a wide smooth piece of leather or a piece of skin equal in length to the finger on top. Then tie it from above according to what suits you, do not cut it and order the patient to rest and make his food soft, because I thought that something in the shape of the face would change, so start operating on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to what suits you, do not cut it and order the patient to rest and make his food soft, because I thought that something in the shape of the face would change, so start operating on the third day. Then mend what you covered with gauze with gauze and egg white or sand with a sewing needle removed from it and put a soft lace on the bandage, as long as the bandage adheres to it and the bone does not change in shape, leave it.
Do not remove it until the fracture heals and strengthens, as this fracture often heals in three weeks. During this time, apply a hot object as mentioned earlier to soothe it.
If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, and the wound has healed and become tight, you can gently extract it from the tool. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with a blunt instrument according to your need.
Then, if all the sutures have been removed and there is nothing left in the wound, close the wound if it is wide and use one of the suitable splints for that. And dress the wound until it is clean.
The Fifth Chapter.
If the fracture is broken, it must be set.
The fracture is more likely to break at the front than at the end of the fragment, and if it breaks, it should be set without causing it to splinter and have sharp edges, as this is easiest to set.
Or, if shards are present in the fracture, and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, prepare two assistants to fix one of them on the end of the broken bone and the other to extend the neck toward the opposite side.
Then smooth the fracture with your fingers until it takes its desired shape and does not have a comb or an inscription, for if you find that the fragment is too long, then place a disc of broken pottery or glass under the neck of the ulna.
And the bone should be according to your need, it should be extended and raised and the disc should be pressed with your hand until the fracture takes its desired shape, if you cannot draw the corner of the fracture outwards so that it goes to the depth of the ulna, then the ulna should lie on its own axis.
And place a wedge in the middle of the bone and make the servant's shoulder lower until the bone of the fracture that is deep below rises to above, then correct the fracture and straighten it with your fingers.
And if you find that a part of the fracture is moving, then cut it off and take out that part if it is held in the bone, using one of the cuts that I have specified for this purpose. After the bone is straightened under the fracture device, which is a device that preserves the pulley and is made of wood or iron and this is its image:
A surgical tool resembling a spoon without ornamentation, its size adjustable according to the size of the bone and the work required, and its length determined by what can be worked on, with one end wider and the other narrower.
If the fracture of the bone that you broke during removing the broad shaft of the bone and closing the tumor was not smooth or if the tumor was close, then close the fracture with sutures and if the fracture is shallow or the tumor is far, then open the fracture with the sutures and the retractors according to the depth of the fracture.
If the tumor is wide, then close the fracture with grease or alcohol and apply it to the bone, and if the bone is not a fracture but a gap, then it is that you should carry the graft obtained from the dust of the horse's hoof with white egg. And place the thin needle on it, then place the ball under the thigh if you need that, and then take a long handle with a narrow head or like that, and then carry the graft with the graft and the handle on the needle and the graft, and take a small piece of thin cloth. Its length should be three fingers and also its width, then insert it into the gap, then insert the gap with the cloth in the position of the pin on the handle that is in the position of the fracture, then bend the pin on the fracture as it rotates. The patient's neck is supported by the correct bone and the patient's incorrect bone, and it is tied multiple times on all sides. I see that the strap fixes the break in a firm way, which is not hidden from you.
You understand that the bandage remains on the broken bone. Therefore, it is recommended to inspect the wound every day whenever you notice that the bandage has come off and fix it immediately, then strengthen the wound, and make the patient's bed on his chest and make under the pillow a small roll at night.
Let the patient raise his leg from the side and raise the fracture of the humerus with the elevation of the elbow or tie his arm to his neck, and do not remove the bandage if there is no accident in the position or swelling for twelve days.
Then rebandage if you see such faces. Tie the strap until it tightens and strengthens the fracture, and it will become stronger and more powerful in eighteen days. This may be in some people less than this.
The sixth chapter.
Fracture of the thigh requires reduction. Tell him that the thigh fracture will break in the wide position of it, not in its letters, so when it breaks or is broken in the middle of it, it is known by touch according to the shape of the fracture.
I have reshaped it according to its natural form from all sides of the sickle, then placed charcoal powder with egg white and white lead on top of a broken piece of flint, then placed a wide flat band on top.
Cover the entire shoulder with a little more than it, as the under part of the band may be drawn in the position of the shoulder, then draw that drawing with white lead until the band lowers, then draw from above with a long glove.
Make it firm and pull the band from under it until it does not leave its place, and check the strap every day as long as the strap relaxes the band if it is not in its place, and the thigh should be pulled to the correct side, and the shoulder should be laced in twenty.
Every day or after twenty-five days if you complete this number, loosen the strap and you will be safe as it is one of the bones that does not fear hair growth or loss, for it was shiny and had grown under the skin, it was cut off and removed. And make what you mentioned in breaking the horseshoe when the hot tumor is relaxed, if something happens to it.
Chapter 7.
This chapter deals with the use of geometry in chest surgery.
If the chest wall is divided in the middle, it tends to lean towards the lower part and shows severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and vomiting. The sides are less affected and may only show mild discomfort.
In case of a chest wound, the blood may seep out and the fracture can be seen in the broken bone. The patient should lie on his back with his hands clenched between his knees and the heels brought together on both sides to bring the wound into alignment on both sides as much as possible.
The bone should be put back in its original position, then a bandage and gauze should be placed over it with a pad from the cover of a pillow or a handkerchief wrapped around it and secured in place after it has been torn in a crack. Then, the bandage should be tightened around the broken bone to prevent it from coming loose. It should be wrapped around the chest several times and made firm, then checked frequently as the patient becomes more relaxed, and the bandage becomes tighter each time.
If the wound becomes exposed due to vomiting, pain, or diarrhea, it should be dressed immediately. Remove the bandage, repair the exposed part according to the treatment plan, and then retie the bandage if necessary. The face and the neck are separated until it is cleared.
The eighth chapter.
The leg bones are understood to have fractured if the fracture is in the thin areas that follow the back and sides of the thigh, as it will be exposed for that reason, as they are brittle and known for that reason, it does not escape notice during inspection with the fingers.
The fracture is corrected by aligning the break with the strong hand until it is in the desired shape, then it is held and the broken bone is bound with bandages if necessary, as the leg fracture is inclined towards the inside it is exposed to severe pain.
It is cut like the nail that exposes its nail to prevent the bone from being covered and also causes great fatigue, vomiting, and profuse bleeding, and the first ones were cut with many hammer blows.
Among them is one who says it is best to make the food of the bandage that produces the wind and breath to make the abdomen expand and pull the fracture outwards and we reject this as it is a guarantee for the occurrence of the hard tumor if it has not happened, but if it has happened it increases it and confirms it.
Some say to place a splint on the spot and then forcefully squeeze it, which is similar to a measure except that it fears that the splint may attract curiosity towards the spot due to its weakness. Some say it is preferable to cover the spot with a piece of cloth that has been soaked in hot oil.
A varix may appear between the ankles until it is filled with fluid, making the tendon flat when lifted on its heel, then the varix is treated with the treatment of a sponge from food and medicine, but if the varix is inflamed, it is a severe matter that cannot be endured. The bone used to tear off the cloth harshly, causing fear of the varix, so it is preferable to cut on the spot and expose the broken nail, then insert the device that preserves the sugar lump and cut the bone and remove it.
Then, collect the wound scars if they are large and treat them with the suture until they are removed, as there is a risk of burning in this process, so start by applying oil on the skin and cover the varix with it and treat the inflammation from inside as well.
It lies on the side that hides the sleep until it is removed.
Chapter 9.
It is necessary to cut the back and neck.
Similarly, if the bones of the neck are affected by a fracture and more of them are exposed, and the same goes for the back, if you expose it to one of them and want to know whether he can be fixed or not. If I saw that his hands had become limp, cold, and dead, and he could not move them or spread them, and if I pressed them with a spoon, he did not feel it and did not find any pain in them, I knew that he would not be able to fix himself in any case and he is a corpse.
If he could move them and feel pain in them with pressure and stretching, I knew that the bones were broken and that the patient would recover with treatment, and if the back was affected in the same way and you wanted to know whether it would also be able to fix itself or not.
If you look at his legs, I saw that they had become limp and something similar had happened to them as happened in the hands, then if he lay on his back the wind and saliva came out without his will, and if he lay on his stomach the belch came out without his will. When lying on his back and desiring to vomit, he was unable to do so, knowing that it is incurable, then there is no need for treatment, as nothing was presented to him, and the treatment for what occurred was to soothe the hot tumor.
When the wound is healed, place on it ointment of rose or with beaten eggs three times a day until the hot tumor is healed, then place a firm, clean bandage over it and bind it tightly, ordering it to be still and quiet.
He should not sleep on the side where he does not find pain until it is relieved, as if it occurred in the bone at the time of the attack, a soft spot or something that can be released from it, it is better to shave the skin and remove that bone. Then the wound of the cut will gather if it is large with the suture, then treat with salt marc until it is relieved, as if the last bone of the thumb is broken and it is the sign of the sin, it is better to enter the incision from the left hand into the seat.
The broken bone is straightened with the other hand, according to what can be done and the straightening appears, then a bandage and a gauze are placed on it if it has become inflamed. Then it is bound.
If you sense a broken piece in your nail, split it off and remove it, then treat the wound with the treatment that follows until it heals.
The 10th chapter.
It is necessary to break the nail.
If the bone of the toe is broken, it will break if it breaks into pieces along its sides and extends in length, turning towards the inside, exposing the joint to injury, causing pain in the place, and cutting the leg bone from which it broke.
And pass your hand over it until you find the break, knowing that if the break is on one side only, you can straighten it according to what suits you from the natural shape.
And if the break is long or has gone inside, place a bandage on the inside of the leg and straighten the break by wearing a splint, then put a bandage made of wood or skin on it and tighten it.
Do not fear the movement of the break or the expansion of the bandage, and fill the tendons with whatever suits you until the pressure is even and the leg aches and orders the ankle to sleep on its side or on its correct side, for it will be flat and warm.
Ignore the size and cut it until the tumor settles and carries what it contains on its advance, then return to its size and tighten as much as possible, for if there are exposed bones with something detached from their sides, it is not recommended to remove.
Do not touch but leave it outside as we said and let its tightness until it releases.
The twelfth part.
In the size of the thigh, crush the bone.
The thigh is between the ligament of the head of the toe, if it breaks, crush it on one of its ends, one of which should have a round hole in the middle of this image.
And tie two bands in its ends, then fasten from a high position and place the broken leg on the seat, then place the broken thigh on the back until it becomes a loop in the middle of the bend, then fasten something heavy from above.
Or he can extend it to the bottom, then the doctor crushes the fracture with his hands until the fracture is in its place, and the other face is that the patient lies on his knees and ties his hand from his neck with a band.
A servant is commanded to fix the upper part of the fracture with one hand and the lower part with the other, and to extend both hands towards their respective parts. If desired, the extension should be stronger, then it should be applied under the fracture and above it, and both servants should be extended towards their respective parts.
If the fracture is near the angle of the scapula, it is preferable to apply the tendon under the shoulder and above the fracture towards the attachment, and likewise if the fracture is near the attachment, it is preferable to apply the tendon on that position and on the attachment itself.
Then, the fracture should be aligned gently until the fracture is in its proper position and does not cause a bad fracture. Then, the fracture should be fixed if there is no heat in the bone, but if there is heat in the bone, leave the fixation until the seventh day and put a poultice of ointment soaked in wine on it.
Until the heat of the bone is extinguished, fix the fracture and then put a bandage on the fracture, then put a new suture on the bandage, then lift the arm over the shoulder and place your hand open on the flexor crease, and put your other hand on the back of the arm.
The fracture and swelling on the thigh and shoulder should make the shoulder support the shoulders' burden, unless prevented by some obstacle or change in the bone structure. If you find that nothing has changed, then use the elbows.
Place a fracture pad on the fracture, which should be higher and stronger than all other pads, and should make a gap between each pad's tip. The length of the pads should correspond to the fracture, with an increase of three fingers from each side.
Then, apply pressure to the swollen shoulder mentioned earlier.
The swelling on your shoulder should be more pronounced in the position of the fracture.
As the swelling decreased after the fracture, I saw the position of the pads and the swelling as we discussed in your arm at the time of your visit, so perform the treatment.
If you fear the tumor, leave the swelling and pads as is for today, as we discussed earlier. Check the pulse every three days to prevent any complications such as inflammation, spasm, or starvation of the organ from excessive swelling, and treat them as we mentioned.
If you are sure that nothing will happen, do not cut the gauze until many days have passed, and let the swelling subside on the surface and the hand on the abdomen and place it under the thigh filled with soft sandbags.
Inspect the shape of the broken bone or the gauze will not be distorted or relaxed, correct it with your effort, and make the food of the swelling on the level we prescribed for the food to be mild first even if the bones become hard.
It is preferred that the food of the thigh and leg becomes hard, as it usually takes forty days for that to happen. Then, it is preferred to cut and use the bath and treat with the remedies that are suitable for that, if the break is a wide fracture.
Do not remove the gauze for more than fifty days or twenty-two days.
The thirteenth chapter.
In fracture of the arm in joints.
The shoulder is a joint composed of two bones, one of which is smaller and located below the head, while the other is larger and located below the smaller one. If the larger bone breaks, it may break alone or if both break at the same time.
When the small upper windpipe is broken, the ribs are easily separated and can be seen more quickly. When the lower windpipe is broken, it was previously stiff and difficult to see, but if both bones are broken at once, then the bone that broke the small upper windpipe.
The physician should make the incision as straight as possible until it is even, and if the large windpipe is broken, he should make the incision deeper, and if both bones are broken, then he should make the incision as strong as possible.
It is recommended that the physician places the hand shape on the ribs and makes the incision as long as possible on a flat surface, with the thumb raised above all fingers, and the pinky below all fingers, and the wrist rests on itself.
The surface should be tilted to the height so that the wrist does not become tangled.
Then the servant's arm is extended from below either by his hand or his fingers, and another arm is extended from above as well. Then the physician straightens the bone until it is placed in the best position possible, if there are fractures, then they should be aligned.
Every bone should be treated with care, as it is the foundation of the body. If a fracture is found, it should be carefully examined. If the break is clean, it can be treated with a simple incision.
If the fracture is a simple one, it can be treated by applying pressure to the affected area. If the fracture is more complex, it may require surgery. The surgeon will use a scalpel to make an incision and then use forceps to remove any remaining bone fragments. The wound will be cleaned and dressed, and the patient will be monitored for any signs of infection.
The surgeon will then apply a gauze pad soaked in ointment made from the sap of the oak tree and mixed with egg white. The arm will be gently elevated and supported with pillows to reduce swelling. The number of bandages used will depend on the severity of the fracture.
The fracture may have occurred in one or both arms. The surgeon will then apply pressure to the affected area, gradually increasing the force until the bone is fully compressed. The amount of pressure applied will depend on the severity of the fracture and the location of the break.
The surgeon will then make a small incision to expose the fracture. The break will be cleaned and any foreign objects removed. The surgeon will then use a scalpel to make a small cut along the fracture line, creating a "window" into the bone. This allows the surgeon to see the fracture and ensure that it is properly aligned.
When something needs to be repaired, such as an abscess in the body, it is preferable that the body part be washed with warm water until the abscess is filled and left uncovered overnight to rest, then resumes swelling.
If the swelling has subsided and the bone is still intact or almost so, then this should be corrected with all your effort, and also note that if food is not reaching the body part due to excessive swelling, it is preferable to slightly move it and leave it for a few days until the food is absorbed, and then it will swell again.
If nothing has been exposed as we mentioned, it should not be treated except after twenty days or so, then the patient should place their hand on their neck and keep their elbow relaxed and conserve their effort from the violent movements and make their sleep on their stomach.
And know that this fracture from the shoulder will heal in thirty days or in two and a half months, or perhaps it will heal in eighteen days, depending on the state of the joints and the strength of the patient.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the treatment of fractures of the hand and fingers.
The manuscript's title translates to "On the Fracture and Dislocation of Bones and on the Positions of the Fingers." The excerpt discusses the appearance of fractures and dislocations, stating that they are often hidden or revealed when the finger is bent. It then asks, "When does a fracture or dislocation of the bone become visible through the position of the finger?
The excerpt translates to "It is best that the patient sits with his knee bent and his foot placed on a level surface." This is a medical instruction for positioning a patient with a knee injury for examination or treatment.
The excerpt translates to "Then, he should place his hand on it, then the surgeon should straighten and align the broken bone, until it fractures well, at which point the patient should hold the splint and the sling if no fracture has occurred, then place a pillow from above according to the position." This is a medical instruction for treating a bone fracture, involving the use of a splint and sling to support and align the broken bone. The patient is advised to hold the splint and sling if no further injury has occurred, and to place a pillow on top of it according to the specific positioning needs of the injury.
The excerpt translates to "It was included in a case of a transverse fracture, if the fracture is from below towards the inner side of the finger, then make a model of the fracture and order the patient to hold it with his bent finger, then the fracture will extend longitudinally." This is a medical instruction for treating a transverse fracture of the finger, involving the creation of a model or replica of the fracture using a piece of material. The patient is then instructed to hold the model with his bent finger, and the fracture is expected to extend longitudinally or lengthwise as a result.
The excerpt translates to "So that the pillow is from the skin, and it does not irritate the skin with all the fingers, and it is held according to what is appropriate, if the fracture is outside, then it is best to make the pillow from above and another pillow from below in the finger so that the hand is open and resting." This is a medical instruction for treating a fracture of the finger, involving the use of a pillow or splint to support and align the broken bone. The pillow should be made from a material that does not irritate the skin, and it should be held according to the specific needs of the injury. If the fracture is outside, then a pillow should be made from above and another from below in the finger, so that the hand is open and resting.
Then the splint is held like the hand and moved between the fingers by the bandage, and if the fracture is exposed to one of the fingers, then the reduction should be made on what is appropriate, and then he should be shaped with the thumb and if you want to make a small support for the fracture to rest it.
And if the fracture is in all fingers like the middle, little, ring, or baby, it should be fixed and tied to the correct finger or tied together on the side, which is best, or a small support can be placed on it.
As we said in the reduction and inspection when you tighten and after it, about the hard tumor, it should be treated with what is appropriate when something like that happens on what repeats and describes it.
The fourteenth chapter.
In the reduction of the finger fracture.
The finger bone is often broken and appears to the sense because it bends forward and backward, and the reduction of the fracture is done by making the bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the thumb rests on its face.
Then, each servant bandage is stretched towards its face according to the adjustment of this if the fracture is in the middle of the bone, and if it is near the finger base, it is better that one bandage be stretched towards us either from silk or like it.
In its original state, the femur should be aligned vertically, with the other tendon situated above and the other gutter positioned below the fracture, especially if the fracture is near the knee. The surgeon should then straighten the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural shape.
The bone should be broken in a good way, and if there is no swelling in the limb, it is not necessary to apply the splint and the bandage. However, if there is inflammation in the limb, leave the inflamed part for a few days until the hot part settles down, then return to treating it.
As for swelling, it is recommended to apply a wide and stiff bandage on the fracture, twice or three times, leaving the rest of the leg as it was. Then, wrap the leg until the knee becomes straight at its original position, and insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg below the knee, near the knee from above, with the threads coming from both sides from the two sides.
Then, take care of the thigh and the leg of what was left of the bandage, then place the fracture in the same position as the splint on the thigh, making it a single splint on the thigh bone, then close the gap between the thigh and the leg with the laceration so that the swelling is even.
Then, starting with medium force on the fracture site, three or four times, and each time afterward, reduce it slightly, and make it firm.
Then, straighten the blade that you inserted between the ankle and the knee, and tie it to the following fends from above, then pass the blade from top to bottom until it reaches the thigh bones, and tighten them with the other ends of the fends.
If the tendon does not come out of its place, then leave the force on it until it does not cause any pain in the part, and does not become swollen or inflamed, and does not cause any gas to be produced, and so on, if something like that happens, then deal with it and correct everything as we have mentioned before.
If there is a bone crack that has become loose, it is better to straighten it if possible, and if not, then cut it off and remove it, and treat the wound as we have mentioned before until it heals, and this fracture of the ankle may not be due to the thigh being added to it.
As we mentioned in the hip and shoulder, except that the hinge of the thigh is not exposed to the knee, and if the hinge alone does not include the thigh, then the person who has it must always have it.
The incision should remain for fifty days, or it may slightly increase or decrease a little, depending on the type of wound and other cases.
The fourteenth chapter.
In the fracture of the knee joint.
The fracture of the knee joint may be exposed to it, and it may be exposed to it widely, but if the exposure is broken or torn in its parts, it will be with wounds and without wounds.
And stand on it all, and straighten it by using your fingers to reunite the parts that were separated from its parts until they come together and break down according to what you can achieve with the straightening, the adjustment, and the correction, then carry the splint and carry a well-made bandage if it has been pulled to this.
And the pressure of the appropriate force for this, then all the cases we described in other fractures such as the burn and similar to it will meet each part with what is suitable for it to be released.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the straightening of the knee joint fracture.
The knee joint has two bones, one of which is thick and is called the shinbone, and the other is thin and is called the tibia, and both are exposed to fractures in the same way as the shinbone. Therefore, the arm became like an arm of a wrist, whether by itself or in operation, for when all the bones are broken, the leg turns in all directions, and when the sharp bone is broken, the leg turns forward, and when the thick bone is broken, this happens from below, which is self-evident.
Therefore, use the pulley and the traction rope according to that, whether not, but it is recommended that if the leg bone is broken, it is a deep break with many fractures, then the pulley should be less and narrower, and coordinate your effort with the leg.
And in the leg, there is something excessive compared to the arm, which is that if you tighten the ropes and exhaust all your effort, you will get two pulleys from the turn of the spring that are used to smooth the doors that are placed between the cracks of the plates or can be made from the Nile weeds or like them.
Choose the one that is narrow and not a squeezing tool, and make its length equal to the length of the leg from the hip downwards, then place each of them on both sides with two knots at the end of the leg and the other side of the direction.
From the knee down to the foot, then tie the straps in three positions on each side and the middle, if this bandage prevents the leg from leaning to the right and north and moving in a good direction, it may use mizab from wood along the leg.
It is placed in it to preserve it from movement and more, especially if there is a specific wound in the fracture, then check the leg every day and take care of it with great attention about the tumor or swelling or any other. If something happens like that, it should be treated with what is appropriate to make it free, the bone of the leg will heal in about thirty days or so.
The seventeenth chapter.
In the fracture of the bones of the leg and fingers.
As for the splint, it does not expose the fracture of the ankle and as for the bones of the leg, it may expose it to the fracture, and the fingers are less likely to be exposed to the fracture, but it may be exposed to the swelling in more cases.
If the bones of the leg are exposed to the fracture and you see that some of them have swollen, then place your foot on the ground with your shoe, then you put your foot on what has risen from those bones and press it and flatten it.
Until the suture returns to its place, then lift the tape and the needle under the sole of the foot, a small plate with two flat heads, then tighten the foot firmly with a clean cut and all that is needed for it.
If after three or four days the suture is loosened, you will find the bones crooked or broken that were previously broken or torn, as you see, and if some fingers are broken, force them back into place according to what you have been told in the book on the bending of fingers.
Then make a splint for the broken finger, long enough to cover it slightly, and then place this plate under the foot that you have been told about and tighten it firmly, if the one that broke from the bones is two or three or more.
Make a splint for each finger, long enough to fit the one that is pulled out of the gap, and tighten the plate under the sole of the foot so that each head of the plate is outside the sole of the foot to make a good fix.
And it is recommended that you do not forget to follow all that has been mentioned to you about the other fractures of the symptoms that have been mentioned and each edge according to what is appropriate.
Chapter Thirteen.
This chapter deals with the surgical procedure for breaking a woman's love lock (a metaphor for a stubborn or difficult situation) and the painful consequences, along with the man's involvement.
When the woman's love lock is broken, she is placed on her side with her face towards the direction of the lock. Then, the surgeon gently pushes the lock away from the front until it is completely exposed. The surgeon then cleanses the lock with a piece of cloth until it is full and resembles a ball.
Then, the woman is made to sit up with her back facing the lock. The cloth is slightly raised until it resembles a ball at the opening of the lock. The painful consequence is then removed, and the woman is made to lie on her back so that she can expel the cloth.
The woman is then made to lie down in the same position as she was initially placed in, and this is repeated seven times or as close to it. This is done because it helps to relieve the pain. If you wish to give the child milk, you can place a hollow tube on her lips and insert the milk into her mouth all at once.
The woman is then made to blow strongly into the tube until the milk in the mouth expands and pushes out the painful consequence. The cloth is then cleansed and she is made to rest for the number of days specified earlier until the pain is relieved. If the painful consequence is from a man or woman's bone, it is used in the suture.
She repaired what we described in the bone of the leg, and do not miss the correctness in these strange wounds that only partially describe and especially for those who had some experience and understand my book, indeed because the fracture itself indicates you in more cases.
In the right way to heal his bone and strengthen it, understand, and as for the man if it breaks, take a piece of wire and insert it into the wound, then place a piece of wire from the fracture and leave it for three days or so until it is free.
The ninth book.
In bone wounds if there is a cut.
For those who are offered a wound with a cut, especially if it is a large bone like the ankle or knee, it is better to remove it as soon as possible, as conditions for removal are as we have presented.
If the wound is bleeding, it is better to remove it immediately by cleaning it with a rag if you do not have one, then heal the fracture in that day at its place and do not delay it.
If there is no heat wound, and if a heat wound occurs, leave the healing of the fracture until the ninth day to allow the heat fracture to settle and do not approach it on the third and fourth days as it exposes it to severe symptoms.
In case the broken bone protrudes through the skin, it should be dressed and contoured with your hands, and if it does not come out and be shaped with your hands, use this instrument made of iron, which is long, about seven fingers or eight. Display it on the wound measure.
Therefore, it is recommended that the surgeon take three or four from it according to the need of the treatment in each kind of fracture and make it contoured so that there is a little rounding on it lest it wrinkle when pressed upon it during work.
And the edge of it should be rounded with a blade on its side and the upper part of it should be rounded and the lower part should be sharp and this is its appearance:
And it is called by the Greeks "birm" which means a small projection, so its edge should be sharp and rounded on the edge of the broken bone and push it with it until if the bone returns to its place and some of its sides are equal, then make a contortion of the sides of the fracture some on each other.
If the broken edge is thin and the instrument did not take it well, it should be cut off that part of the bone until the instrument can get hold of it, if it cannot redress the bone with what we described, cut it according to its shape among the cuts we mentioned.
If the bone is swollen and inflamed, and after being moved back to its original position causes severe pain, it indicates that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can return the bone to its natural position, it will greatly benefit the swelling. If you complete the operation on the bone, insert a piece of cloth into the dark wound, especially if it's in the summer and you don't put anything oily or greasy on it.
To prevent inflammation and infection, use the forceps immediately when you're done with the bone operation and leave the wound open by placing a nail on the edge of the wound.
Be cautious not to widen the wound with the fracture, as many doctors have caused this by either killing their patients or making them eat or die, so be careful not to make our wound worse than the fracture.
If the wound is gaping or large and you're worried about the symptoms of a gaping wound that we described, it's not recommended to put forceps on it and make incisions with sharp nails in the place of the forceps and widen it with them.
When it has been a day or two and I see the wound beginning to produce pus, I remove the incision that was made with wine, then use the curette and the forceps that we used to perform the surgeries such as the four-rooted forceps and similar, and it is advisable for you to use the forceps.
The wound should be examined every day in the evening and morning until it subsides and drains, and it is advisable to insert a bone nail from the wound downwards with ease, because if the wound has been for many days and the pus has not come out or the wound has not closed, know that there are small fragments of bone in the vicinity.
It is advisable to clean the wound with the awl, whatever fragments of bone were embedded in it, remove them and whatever was not embedded, which used to penetrate the bone and cause pain, cut it off and remove it from both sides, you can do this.
If the presentation of the wound is a boil, ulcer, or some other form of corruption and ulceration, it is advisable to meet each presentation with the treatment that you have been offered and described in that section.
And what you should do when I say it and prepare your mind if a large bone breaks and presses on the part such as the bones of the foot and toe, and similar of the large members, do not expose yourself to attracting it or extracting it. Many times, death is presented as a result of it, but it leaves it to dry until it falls from its own self after twenty days or thirty.
Therefore, the wound is treated if I see a place for treatment in it, otherwise, it is left.
The chapter thirteenth.
In the treatment of the confusion that is presented after some fractures.
Many times, this confusion is presented after the bone is healed and especially near the joints, it changes the shape of the part and sometimes prevents the part from performing its natural function.
I thought that if the confusion is severe, to use drugs such as stramonium, lard, murri, aniseed, and other similar substances, which are taken from some of them or all of them and diluted with water or egg white or egg yolk.
And to apply it to the confusion and to strengthen it with good pressure and leave it without healing for many days, then heal it and repeat it until the confusion disappears if God wills, or apply it with a dose of lead powder.
For the lead has a special effect of removing everything from the parts, if the confusion has become hard and increased and stimulated the necessity to remove it, it cuts off from above and cuts off the future fever or removes it with some of the ointments until it disappears and the wound is treated until it is healed.
The 10th chapter.
If the bone is fractured and remains soft after that, it should be treated differently from the first injury.
If the bone is fractured and remains soft after that, it is due to many reasons. One of them is either the excessive tightening and fixing of the ligaments on unsuitable parts, or the excessive tightening of the ligaments until food cannot enter the bone, or it could be due to excessive cutting of the ligaments, excessive movements outside of their time, or a lack of blood in the wound and weakness of the injured part.
The treatment for this is to feed the wound and stimulate its body until blood increases in it, using a bath, introducing joy and happiness on it, and similar things, then carrying the bandage on the part to attract food to it or to moisten the ligaments with the watery serum. Until food returns to its natural form.
The 11th chapter.
If the fractured bone is tightened and prevented from moving on its proper part, it should be treated in this way.
When a bone member was fractured or broken due to injury, or deformed and twisted, the appearance of the bone became distorted. However, the bone continued to function naturally and it is not advisable to accept the statement of those who claim to have broken the bone from the head, as many unqualified doctors and surgeons in our country used to do this.
This action is a great error that leads to great weakness, but if the fracture and deformation are deliberate, it is better that they be treated with water in which the mucus of the sea slug, such as the snot of the cow and the bucket of the king, has been boiled.
The fractured bone is treated with the mucus of the sea slug, such as the snot of the cow and the bucket of the king, or by taking the raw material of the sea slug and rubbing it with chicken fat, ghee of sheep, ointment of shire, and by applying or taking the dried tallow and the drugs called antidotes.
The deformation is dissolved by the constant, thin gauze that is in the hand and is used to move the bone to all directions at all times, if the fracture has become more serious and hardened, it becomes necessary to treat it with iron.
It is recommended to incise and disconnect the bone, cutting as much of it or the bone as possible with smooth cuts, using force and care, then treat the wound as described by him until it is clean.
The third chapter and twentieth section.
The jaw is a free fragment of the skeleton that obstructs movement and takes on the shape of the organ, causing severe pain on the affected side. When exposed to someone, it is recommended that they immediately respond.
The delay in responding to the bite is not recommended as it makes the treatment of the wound more difficult, so it should not be delayed, moved, or stretched while biting as it often causes severe pain and inflammation.
However, if the bite is exposed, it is recommended that they immediately stop biting and leave it to heal slightly before immersing the affected part in hot water and oil, then dress and treat each part as described in its position.
The chapters of the jaw were also arranged according to their position on the body, from the top to the bottom.
Chapter Fourteen.
In treating the treatment of the lower lip wart.
If the wart does not disappear, it will be removed in the following way: either it is cut off from one of its two places of appearance, so that it completely disappears, or it is completely removed by scraping it off. Then it should rest for a little while. Until it reaches the back, so that the wart is not able to swallow it and cannot apply its cure, and its mouth becomes sore from speaking, then if it is removed in a slow way, it may return to the same state as before, with the least thing.
And if it is completely and fully removed, it should be hastened to return as soon as possible, and do not delay its appearance, which is that the servant of the head of the wart enters the doctor's hand into the inside of his mouth, if the cure is from one side.
Or if both hands are entered, if the cure is from both sides and all fingers of his hand are outside, he orders the wart to remove it and throw it away to go to every side and the doctor cleans the cure and pushes it back to its place.
In the event of difficulty in washing, and especially if the whole body is involved, the ablution should be performed with hot water and oil until the washing becomes easy and does not prolong the act of washing. If it returns to its original state and becomes straight again without wrinkling, then the folds of the skin are gently pressed with a soft cloth that has been made from the leaf and oil of the date palm.
Then, it is tied with a knot that does not disturb the straightness of the body, and its head and back are wrapped between two bands so that it does not move to the right or left, nor twist, but makes its food soft and pleasant for us.
Until the pain subsides and the wound closes, let it eat what has been given to it, and use it with care and do not allow it to open its mouth when eating, drinking, or defecating until the wound closes and expels.
If the wound does not close quickly after being opened, it is often due to frequent colds and perineal pain, and sometimes the abdomen may protrude, and sometimes it may be swollen and red for a long time. If you see this, know that it is a sign of failure.
Many people die from this exposure in ten days.
The fifth and twenty-fourth section.
In the answer, the traction is removed and the angle is cut off.
And traction, it does not break from the inside side of its connection with the ribs and may break outside, and this is evident to the senses, and it should be relaxed for the patient to lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then, the position is pressed with forceps, it returns, then the gauze and the ropes are put on it, and the corner that follows the angle and connects to it should not be removed except in emergency, for if it is removed, it may not be restored and may not be placed as we mentioned earlier.
Then, the gauze and the ropes are put on it, and the patient is ordered to give a call for peace and tranquility until he releases it, and with this treatment, the corner of the angle returns even if it is still out of its position.
The sixth and twenty-eighth section.
In the answer, the angle is removed.
Note that the angle can only be broken in three ways, one of which is to break it towards the tailbone below, the second is to break it towards the chest, and perhaps it can break above the angle, and this happens in emergency.
The operation must not be performed behind the elbow or in front of the nerve, and more so that it extends towards the shoulder and especially in those with little meat because it exits quickly and enters quickly.
However, for those with much meat, it is better that it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty, and perhaps some people may think they have cut or broken the bone, causing pain and swelling in their shoulder, so they should test this until they are sure of its safety.
Then in treating it, and if the cut is below the shoulder towards the shoulder, it will be recognized when there is a difference between the broken and correct humerus, and you will find on the head of the humerus a mark and under the shoulder when you touch the head of the humerus it will feel like a ball.
The patient cannot raise his hand to his ear or move it, and if he cuts towards the stomach or upwards, you will find this apparent when touching it, without it being hidden.
This cut may make it easier to treat if the patient was an adult or the victim was a child, and the treatment is for the waiter to raise his hand above his head, then you place your hand under the shoulder and raise the elbow to its position and the waiter raises his hand and extends it above.
After this, it should be lowered because it returns quickly, if it does not return as we mentioned and has been absent for many days, it is advisable for the patient to immerse in hot water and use the nail that stirs and makes the paste of khatala and halba and the pot of the king in the water and uses it.
Then the patient lies on his side and a soft sphere of alabaster is placed under his thigh, which is moderate between the laxity and rigidity, then the doctor places the hand behind it and holds the patient's hand with his own and extends it downwards.
And he pushes the sphere with his leg if it returns upright, and if you want to repeat it on this side, it is that you prepare a longer leg than the patient's and stop it from the side of the ribs and enter his foot under the thigh of the patient and raise his thigh until the patient is fixed in the air. Another waiter draws the patient's hand down the belly if the patient is light, it is advisable for something else to be tied around it so that the return of the feces is delayed, and it may also turn towards another side.
And it is that a long piece of wood is placed on the ground with a rounded head like the hawn, not too thick and not too thin, then it is placed under the patient's thigh after placing a groove on the top of the wood for the patient and the patient stands on the length of the wood.
The surgeon then extends their hand from the other side and the body from the opposite side, as the bone quickly returns to its place. Therefore, the difficulty in all that we mentioned is this treatment, which is to take a piece of wood about the length of two thumbs. And he presents it at the length of four fingers and thickens it at the length of two fingers, making it a rounded head to facilitate its insertion into the depth of the bone in this image.
Then, a notch is made on the rounded head to avoid damaging the wooden piece, and then it extends under the bone and the hand and arm over the wood until it is tied to the elbow and wrist, and the wood is tied to the carpal and metacarpal bones.
Then, the elbow is placed on the table. The hand is extended and the rest of the body is fixed from the other side, as the bone enters from the wrist. If it can be inserted from any side, it is better to place a soft ball under the elbow.
Then, the greased bandage with resin, wax, and egg white is carried on both sides as it rotates from above. The ball is then rolled down under the bone, becoming firm and moving the bandage over the scar on top of the hand, and the surgeon ties their hand to their neck.
A surgeon should not handle a patient's hand for more than seven days, and it is advisable to reduce the patient's diet to strengthen the affected part, as this speeds up recovery. After seven or five days, they should practice movement with the hand, and if it remains stable without swelling, it has recovered.
If the joint becomes loose due to moisture exposure or another cause, it is recommended to use the knife with three saws as described in Chapter 3 of the knife book. After seven days, the bone will be reassembled, and the joint will not recover.
The tendon was repeatedly hit around the joint, but it did not recover and fell, becoming limp. I realized that the nerve in the top of the pin had either extended, stretched, or become limp, and I knew at that time that the joint would never be stable.
The incision that is towards the chest and abdomen, and then extends to the back of the body, should be pushed and moved with the hand until it returns, and all other swelling and treatment are used until it is clear. After the removal, there will be a gap in the joint, and it will take longer to move.
The bath should not be used repeatedly on the same patient, as that would lead back to its original nature.
The seventh book and twentieth chapter.
In the treatment of abdominal hernia.
The hernia of the abdomen is difficult to reduce and also returns with difficulty, and it reduces in all directions, especially forward and backward. The reduction of the hernia is not hidden from you as it is visible and palpable under any shape that protrudes.
If the reduced hernia is correctly placed, you will see this by a clear indication of the protruding part and it cannot be flexed by the elbow or moved away from it, and it is recommended that you immediately reduce the hernia from your watch before it becomes exposed to heat.
If the hernia is exposed to heat, it becomes difficult to reduce and maybe it did not reduce completely, especially if the reduction was to the back. Then, you should use the most severe types of reduction and more often, as it often leads to death.
If the hernia can be reduced, it should be done by making the patient's hand push the protruding part with both hands or with the thumb until it returns to its original position.
When the incision is towards the front, it may be reversed by flexing the hand once until it strikes the opposite side of the palm that meets it. If the incision cannot be reversed, use the strong, sharp force of the hand, which is to extend the arm in a servile manner.
The assistant should also hold the patient's clothing or sleeve with both hands to prevent it from being pulled away during the movement of the arm, and if the surgeon proceeds with his fingers, he should clean them with grease to make the joint easy to dislocate.
Then he should force the joint to dislocate, and after it has returned, it is recommended that he carry the dressing that contains the bandage for swelling with egg white and tighten it firmly but not too much, and tie the arm around the neck of the assistant and leave it for a few days.
Then if the joint is firm, untie the bandage from it and leave it, and if I see that the joint has not tightened, then reapply the bandage and dressing and leave them for a few more days until it becomes tight, and if there is any swelling after the joint returns and is released.
It is difficult to move, let him use steam in the bath, gentle rubbing, and massage until it becomes smooth or make an incision on the joint, then tie it and leave it there for a day and night, then remove it and enter the bath, if it sweats, wipe the joint with gentle warmth.
Then reapply the method three times with entering the bath until it becomes smooth, and if you want to make him have a greasy liver that is moist and firm, apply it several times until he returns to his original state.
Chapter Eighteen and Twenty-Eighth.
In the treatment of scar tissue.
Scar on the hand often tears and unravels, but if it is quickly peeled off at the time of its rupture, it will not affect other joints except that it should be done before setting the position or exposing it to hot air.
To peel off the scar, put the scar on a board and make the patient's helper hold his hand firmly on the end of the joint and push it until it returns, except if he looks to see if the tear is at the bottom of the hand.
The surgeon should place the patient's exposed hand on the table, with the palm facing upwards, so that the physician's hand can rest on the same joint of the finger. If the hand is rotated, it should be fixed with a cast for the tumor.
Leave it alone if it does not recover after a few days, as the distal end will remain on its own and will not cause any harm unless the hand becomes relaxed and cannot grasp anything.
So you learn that the nerve may be severed or torn, and there is no remedy for it except that it should be tightened as much as possible, and if the splint is regained, it should be worn for five days.
Then it should be worn and the hand should be exercised if it is difficult to move and there is something in the joint, such as a bone fragment, then wash it with warm water and massage it several times until it becomes smooth.
The ninth and tenth sections.
In the treatment of finger deformities.
If a finger deforms, it may deform towards the tip or the back of the finger. In this case, straighten the finger and pull it back with your hand until it returns to its original position, then tie the tip of the finger to the side from which it deviated.
In the evening, leave it for two days and stretch it until the day's thickness is reached. If it is tied in the evening, it will remain the same the next day and be trained by movement, and it is tied at night until it becomes firm.
Similarly, if it breaks to the inside of the hand, tie it to the opposite side as it was before and do as you did first until it is clean, and similarly, do it when it breaks to all sides.
The thirtieth section.
In the treatment of splitting the back of the hand.
When the splitting of the back of the hand or the splitting of the entire back or when the wounds are numerous from their places, there is no treatment for it because death speeds up the healing.
The sign of it is that the wound of the dead does not expel itself against its will and cannot be closed, and often parts of his leg or arm or one of them are released, and if there is only one wound from a place, it is often lost.
The spreading of it to four sides is called a hernia, and the treatment of it is that if the hernia has occurred from the navel, there is no treatment for it nor from it, and if it has occurred from a fall or a blow or such, then.
She mentioned it earlier in long treatments of therapy, but its benefits were not as significant as the latter's concise explanation of a little of what they brought, clarifying its meaning and explaining it, and depicting the device differently from what was explained and clarified.
I say that the scar on the chest does not have any secret or hidden part, and the same applies to the ones on both sides. However, it is treated specifically for the one on the chest because of its description, which is that it extends across the face.
A frame should be placed close to the wall, with its border extending under it and being moist but not causing discomfort to the chest. Then, a moistened board should be placed in a hole in the earth, facing towards the head of the frame, and another board facing towards the feet of the frame on the other side of the frame.
A servant should hold the board to prevent it from getting stuck in the hole, while another servant holds the other board on the same side. Then, it is laid on the chest of the patient under the shoulder blade, with thin ribbons tied to the board at the head and tied to the board at the feet.
Then, tie ribbons above and below the patient's hips and at the waist. Tie all the ribbons together and tie them to the other board on the patient's feet. Make sure the boards do not move from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not true, as we said, the surgeon places his hand on the wound with force until it returns or places a plate on top of it. Then he leans on the plate with both hands until it returns. If this treatment does not work, he takes a plate with a length of about three forearms.
And he digs into the wall that we said should be near the wound, a place where he enters his hand, then he places the middle of the plate on the chest and the surgeon leans on the other side with both hands until the wound throbs well.
And it returns to its place, and if you want to make it with wood that sticks to the hand, it is that you dig into the earth at the end of the wound in the back of the dressing box two pieces of wood, whose length is the shoulder and on both sides of the dressing box two pieces of wood.
And let there be between each piece of wood a stone made in each piece, and the bone is passed through all the pieces and they are fixed in the earth yes until the wound does not move and returns with a return, which is the bone that is glowing in it in the two holes of the wooden pieces.
In the side of the bone, there is a hole made by a chisel, as long as a thumb nail, in the two other grafts similar to this, then the tendon that was strengthened in the ribs of the thigh, at the top of it, and the tendons that were strengthened in the thighs, at the bottom of it.
Then the servant stands in front of each thigh, with his hand on the thumb grip of the thigh, and the physician places the hammer on what we have given him, this is a picture of the thigh, the servant and the knee:
Then, after the incision is closed and the position is set, it is best that you carry the dried bandage with egg whites, then the needle, then place a piece of cloth above the bandage, its width should be three fingers or so, and its length should be what takes the position of the hammer.
And on some correct grafts, then tie it to the tendon that should be used, and use the knee soft food until it is cleared, because there may still be some flesh in the position at the end of the clearance, it is best to use the drugs that rinse and clean with the use of the cloth that we described a long time ago.
And you may use a lead sheet in this, and there may be some flesh left in the end of the spine grafts, thinking it will come off and it is excess bone that has not been removed yet, do not expose yourself to this treatment because it may cause death.
The 10th Century Arabic Textbook on Surgery by Albucasis, Chapter 32.
In the treatment of a ruptured fistula.
Explain that the fistula and the cicatrix only expose their respective areas to the fistula, and not to the gradual thinning and desquamation of other areas. The fistula can be closed on four sides.
Explain that the fistula can be closed from the inside out, and more so from the outside in, and most from the inside. The sign of closure is when the patient's own healthy leg bone is closed, and it is longest when the opposite side is closed.
Explain that the hip is more stable and the thigh does not twist at the hip, and the position beyond the hip is indicated by the fact that the head of the femur has moved there.
Explain that the sign of closure to the outside is opposite to these symptoms, and the sign of closure to the front is that the patient's leg is fully extended, but it does not twist the hip and if the walking is not possible, it is not possible to extend it forward.
Explain that the patient's leg is swollen and the hip is tense during walking, and the sign of closure to the back is that the hip does not extend and cannot twist the thigh before it twists the knee, and the patient's leg is shorter than the other.
The Arabic language is flexible and the head of the thigh is clearly visible when the incision is made at the appropriate position, as we understand. Regarding the types of this cut, it is that you should observe, for if the cut was old and its owner did not try to correct it, it remains in its original state and there is no treatment for the bite.
It should not be exposed to this, and as for the one who made the cut, it was from one of the four faces of the cut. He should have first washed the bone and extended it inside and outside, moved it gently and firmly, and perhaps.
He should not have returned without another treatment, for if he does not return in this way, it is recommended that a strong attendant be appointed to pull his leg from below either with his hands or with a strap tied above the knee and another attendant to pull him from above.
His hands should enter from below his thigh, then pull with a strap tied above the knee and hold the end of the strap with another attendant, third, who should be able to pull it either from the front towards the heel or from the back towards the chest.
His pulls should be done all at once until the patient's body rises from the ground and remains fixed, for this type of pull is a common type for the four types, and if the cut is returned as we described and there is no other choice, then each type has its own specific treatment.
The patient's incision should be closed from inside out. The surgeon should lie the suture on the side of the corrector, then insert hooks on the fascia at the head of the fascia and in the position below the ribs.
Then the garter is pulled up from the position below the ribs to the top of the body to the position of the triceps. Then another servant with strong arms and hands takes the thin part of the corrector and pulls it out strongly, returning it to its position.
This type is easier than other types of treatment for this organ, as it is difficult and unnecessary to enter through this type of treatment. Therefore, it is recommended that both sutures of the corrector be tied with a strong garter on the shoulders and on the hips and knees.
After each one of them, the suture will be four fingers long and the upper limb will be more extended than the other by two fingers. Then the corrector is tied on the head with a piece of wood that is in the house and it is followed by two hands on the ground.
Then a strong servant is ordered to hold the head of the limb and tie another suture on the corrector, pulling the other suture on the limb with force, as the joint returns quickly to its position. If the personal incision is outside, then the personal closure is as follows:
The patient should lie on the operating table according to what we described in the case of the horse, and tense the tendon on the affected leg especially and on his chest, then place one piece of bandage on his thighs and the other on his head, then place an extra piece of bandage in the middle of the table securely.
A damp cloth may be placed on it to avoid injuring the patient, so that the bandage does not stick to his heel below the knee, then each servant spreads their leg and the doctor moistens the wound with their hands, and if the patient responds to the sitting.
Or, place a cloth on him according to what we mentioned in the case of the horse, except that it is preferred that the patient's leg should be lying on its correct side, and if it is removed forward, then the patient's leg should be bent once while he is on this description with his hand on the table.
The doctor should place his left hand on the patient's affected thigh and press it with his other hand, while the pressure is applied from below to the direction of the hip, and if the leg is removed backward, it is not preferred that the patient should be bent down.
He is elevated on the earth but should ideally be a topic on something solid, like being also from infirmity and his leg being dislocated from the knee, as we mentioned regarding his dislocation in the clinic, with the tendons protruding.
As we said, the splint should also be used on the place where the sesamoid bone came out, so if you complete the return of the sesamoid bone according to what is supposed and its return mark is not hidden from you, it is that the thigh bones should be straightened.
If I see them as two levels and the sesamoid bone grabs the thigh bone and extends it without difficulty, know that the member has returned according to what is supposed at this time, so tie the thighs and carry the splint and bend the knee strongly so that the kneecap does not move to any of the sides.
It is necessary for the sesamoid bone. The quiet should last for three or four days, and then release the tendon and splint and tie the thigh by another way, if I see them in their place, know that the dislocation has been fixed and free the sesamoid bone to walk, and if I see something from relaxation.
Go and tighten it and bend it according to your first strength and leave it for three days, then release it and make him walk slowly on it for days if God wills, so that he becomes strong.
The second and third sections.
In the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee dislocates in three directions: inward, outward, and downward towards the heel, but not upward towards the head, and the sign of dislocation is when the patient complains that the leg hurts when the thigh is moved towards the knee.
If the knee does not latch onto the thigh, it is dislocated, and all directions of dislocation must be checked by sitting the patient down with their leg extended and the helper behind them to support it and pull it back slightly, then you should sit on their thigh.
And fasten your face to theirs and make their leg between your legs, then secure their knee with yours and clasp their hands together on their knee, then firmly grasp the sides of their knee with your hand and have another helper pull their leg back until the knee returns to its original position.
The sign of return is when the thigh fastens to the knee in a firm grip, then tightens and secures the thigh to the knee, and then ties them together with three straps for three days or four, and then unties them, and only walks a little for a few days until it becomes strong.
If you find it difficult to return according to what we have described and if you cannot use the strong force with the pins we have described for the cure until you return, then...
The third chapter of the thirty-second book.
In the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome.
Carpal tunnel syndrome may improve gradually and completely, and its treatment can be either internal or external. A sign of its cure is that you can see the hand swelling brightly towards the side that was affected.
For the treatment of gradual improvement, it is easy to reverse it by holding it with your hands and straightening it until it returns. If it becomes completely cured, it is recommended that you sit down with your elbows on a table and hold it with the strong hand of someone behind your back in the middle of it.
Then hold your right foot with your left hand from the top of the foot and your right foot with your left hand from the bottom of the foot in the position of the ankles. Then lift your right foot with your left hand, then with your right hand, and then stretch it with your right hand towards your leg without force.
Do this twice as we have described, then lift your foot towards the knee in the third time and you will walk with the ankles. If it returns in one or two times on this position and you see the foot is horizontal, then repeat the work if it does not return.
If you refuse to turn it as we have described, then place the incision on its side on the ground and stretch it out on the ground, making a deep mark between its fingers, lest it cause harm to the incision, then fix the servant's thumb.
Then, stretch the other hand of the man either by his hands or by his arm and tie it around the neck of the man, then stretch all the servants' hands parallel to the incision's edge and hold them so that the body does not sag down below the edge, then the physician should straighten the wound with his hands.
And another servant should hold the correct leg downwards so that the wound returns quickly, if the wound returns and you see its health return, hold the bandage and the stitch with ribbons and narrow straps, and stretch the heel with the strap below, it is recommended to avoid the nerve that is above the knee from behind.
So as not to strain the bandage on it, leave it for two or three days, then it will relax and become loose, then remove it on the third or fourth day, and the incision will stop moving for forty days.
Previously, it was not secure for the incision to close and heal, and further treatment would not be acceptable after that. Therefore, when exposing the hot ram, it is recommended to use what we described in the context of non-surgical and suturing until it goes away.
The Fourth Chapter and Thirteenth Verse.
In the treatment of male finger cuts.
It is recommended to dress the wound with a gentle, non-violent bandage that is not difficult but easier, and if the cut is in some toes of the foot, it should be placed on the foot at a level position on the ground.
Or on a board while standing as a donkey, then place your foot on one of those digits and press it with your foot strongly until it returns and is stable and there is no movement in the position.
Then, place a board under the sole of the foot so that the entire foot is on it and make its head square and thin for three days, then remove it and protect it from walking for many days until it becomes strong and returns, if God wills.
The Fifth Chapter and Thirteenth Verse.
In types of incision, whether it is with wound or without wound, or both.
Something of this kind happened, it was treated and amputated, often followed by death.
Therefore, it should not be offered for treatment of such kind except the one who is skilled in the craft long-lasting, fine, healing, not broken and uses at the beginning the drugs that are in the hot gangrenous tissues only and surrenders the surgeon.
Only for the safety from the ache with the stealth of the disease and it appeared to You in it some request, please fulfill it from Your time in the first place before the occurrence of the hot gangrene.
If the member returns to what you desired, use the treatment that is in the hot gangrenous tissues and treat the wound with what is suitable for it from the drying washes, if the incision is with wound and occurred in the bone with spreading of edges, then remove them. And this corresponds to what we mentioned in the simple diseases that are presented in their places.
And be careful of your effort and purify yourself from entering the path of corruption for what you have presented and my will to you is that it remains for your sake and submits to your appearance if Allah wills.
