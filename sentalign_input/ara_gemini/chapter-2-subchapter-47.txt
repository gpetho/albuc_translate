Chapter forty-seven on the treatment of men's breasts that resemble women's breasts
The breast of some people may swell at puberty until it resembles a woman's breast, remaining swollen and unsightly.
So whoever dislikes this, it is appropriate to make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner from line B to line C.
Then, remove all the fat.
Then, fill the wound with the healing medication.
Then, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals.
If the breast droops downwards and becomes loose due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to make two incisions on its upper sides, resembling a crescent shape, with each one joining the other at their ends so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one, in this way:
From line B to line C.
Then peel the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat.
And use what we mentioned of stitching and sutures, and what it needs of treatment until it heals.
If you are unable to completely cut what you should cut due to the patient's restlessness or because of bleeding,
then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment,
and leave it until it eats away what remains of the fat,
then treat it until it heals.
