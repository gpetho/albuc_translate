Which resemble women's breasts.  The breasts of some people may swell at puberty until they resemble women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly.  Whoever dislikes this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner.	The breasts of some males may swell on attaining puberty so as to resemble the female breast, and they remain permanently swollen and ugly.	0.6334952
From line B to line C: Then excise all the fat, then fill the wound with the desiccating medication, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the breast sags downwards and becomes flaccid due to its size, as happens with women.	If this is abhorrent, a semicircular incision should be made on the breast, like this figure, from b to g. Then dissect away all the fatty tissue and pack the wound with a cicatrizing compound and sew the lips together and dress until healed.	0.6442846
It is necessary to make two incisions on its upper sides resembling crescent shapes, each one joining the other at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller one in this way: From line B to line C.  Then excise the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat, and employ what we have mentioned regarding suturing, bandaging and the necessary treatment until it heals.	But if the breast is pendulous and flabby on account of its size, as happens with women, you should make two semicircular incisions on the upper side, the ends joining one another, in such wise that the longer incision encircles the other like this, from b to g. Then dissect away the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat and sew up as we have described; and apply styptic powder and the necessary dressings until healed.	0.73689276
If you cannot excise all that you need to excise because of the patient's restlessness or due to bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in the corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat, then treat it until it heals.	But if you cannot make the incision as full and perfect as it ought to have been, because the patient is restless, or because haemorrhage arises, you should pack the wound with cotton wool soaked in corrosive ointment and leave till it eats away the remainder of the fat; then dress until healed.	0.86671644
