On the blocking of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four things:
either grain, or an insect, or a mineral stone or similar thing such as iron;
or a seed, such as vetch, beans, peas;
or a flowing thing such as water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other type of thing falls into the ear that does not stick to the ear, nor grows in the ear, place the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then instill a little violet oil or sesame oil, then attempt extraction;
and make him sneeze with condiments, and block his nostrils when the sneeze comes, and wrap pieces of cloth or wool around his ear;
and stretch the ear upwards.
Often it will come out with this treatment;
and if it does not come out, attempt extraction with fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it jumps out with the forceps, that's good;
If not, then attempt extraction with a fine hook, slightly curved;
and if it doesn't jump out with that, then make a tube of bronze and push the end of the tube into the opening of the ear firmly, and plug what is around the tube with soft wax so that air cannot enter with the tube;
then pull it out strongly, because it often comes out as we have said;
And if it doesn't come out in this manner, then take birdlime, which is used to catch birds, and put some on the tip of an instrument suitable for this purpose, and put a bit of cotton around it;
then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not come out with all these things that we have said, then hurry to cut open the ear before a hot abscess and spasm develop;
And the way to make the incision is that you first have the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to their strength, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear in the fatty or adjacent area;
and the incision should be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and quickly suck it out with your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, then administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin, subtle spatula according to this form:
and administer an incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it;
then extract it with fine forceps and by suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is alleviated.
For water that falls into the ear, the patient must first use sneezing powders, and fill the ear with old cotton.
And lie on the same ear where the water is.
If it comes out because of this, that is good. 
If not, take many stones the length of your little finger, thin and light, and heat them a little in the fire;
and the patient puts one in the opening of his ear, and jumps up and down on one foot, and strikes the stone that is in the ear with another stone; 
and do not stop doing this from stone to stone until all the water comes out, and thus it will all come out; 
and if you wish, take a rush, and put one end in the ear, and light the other end until most of the rush is burned;
then do the same with other rushes until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.
In extracting the creature, if it is small-bodied, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the section;
but if it is large-bodied so that it can be felt, then administer extraction with forceps;
and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms generated in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the section on and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment is not effective, then you must examine the ear in the sunlight:
if any worms appear, pull them out with fine forceps, and if they don't appear, take the cannula which has this shape:
And let it be narrow below and wide above.
And put the narrowest end into the ear according to the degree of the patient's discomfort, then suck strongly with the cannula;
do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they don't come out, then pack cotton around the cannula as I described for stones;
and if they don't jump out as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have proven effective in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distill your oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see:
And it should be made of silver or brass, narrow below with a small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside, use a well-made brass instrument for this purpose, and if you wish, take a razor and carefully wrap cotton around the tip;
then pour your oil or juice, and whatever medicine you want, into the cannula, and the cannula should be in the ear;
then insert the razor with the cotton, and press your hand gently until the oil is distilled into the cavity of the ear;
and the patient should feel it inside, and the distillation should be slightly warmed by fire before it is distilled into the ear;
and be careful that it is not too cold, because the medicine would not be as effective.
