Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After completing this book for you, O sons, which is the last science in medicine with its complement, and having reached its end in it, by explanations thereof and its declarations, I found it pleasing to me to complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, chirurgery with my hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	For the operation with the hand is laid down in our region and entirely cut off in our time: until perhaps science of it perishes, and its track is cut off: and none of them remained except small descriptions in ancient books, which have changed hands: and an error and doubt occurred to them until their intentions were closed, and the will of its was extended: I found it pleasing to me to revive it with the intention of this treatise in it according to the life of its position, and its declaration, and its abbreviation: and to make it like the forms of the cauteries and other instruments of work: when addition is made from its declaration, and from its operation which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	However, the cause why this skilled artisan with his hand did not find good in our time is: because medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to exercise before this in knowledge of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the excitement of the members, and their forms, and their conjunction, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and tendons, and number of them, and their exit, and pulsars, and quiet, and exits of their places:
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for that reason Hippocrates said that the name when it is with the name is much, and when it is with the work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is not aware that we are speaking of anatomy, does not understand, and thus falls into the error in which men are killed: just as I have seen many of them, who, being formed by this science, throw it aside without knowledge and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What is that, because I have seen a stupid physician cut an abscess of the gross and it happened that some arteries were cut in the neck: therefore the woman's blood flowed until she died, until she became a dead woman in her hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I have seen another physician who presumed to extract the stone that had passed through the urethra in youth, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore he went to him, and extracted it with a small force.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	And the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	Indeed I had already called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the weakness of its position that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who received a bone from a certain duke of our land for medicinal purposes: and it happened to an black eunuch, who was with him, a fracture near the heel: and the physician, with ignorance of his own, hurried up and tied the fracture with a thumb on the palm with strong strings, and did not release the wound's expiration.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he released him according to his desire.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Later he released him for some days, and commanded him not to untie the bandage: and he stood thus until the abscess of his leg was cured, and his foot, and then he forced it to death.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called to him, and I went to loosen the bandage: and immediately peace came, and he was free from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, corruption had already settled in the member: and I could not stop it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, let corruption walk around in the member until it perishes.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous carbuncle: and the wound became after days, until the malice of it grew with its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, because when there is a pure cancer from the melancholic humor, it does not need to be treated with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can bear it, so that the whole of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for this reason, O Son, it is necessary for you to know that the operation when done with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation which is associated with safety, and the operation which is dangerous in many positions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already stirred up this book in all its places where the operation comes, in which there is fear and trembling.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to guard against this, and let it go: so that fools may not find a way to speak and disgrace themselves.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take the measure with anxiety and protection, and your weakness with ease and firmness, and use the better way of grace from God for salvation and praiseworthy success: and let go of difficulties of life-endangering diseases: and take your souls away from him who makes you afraid, so that he may enter into superstition upon your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining for your glory, and sublime in this world, and finally for your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You should not heal evil with evil, nor call bad doctors good.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	This book has already been divided into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	First Chapter. Of cauterization with fire and with sharp medicine, a book divided into sections from the head to the feet, and the forms of the instruments and tools of cauterization, and everything necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Second Chapter. Of sectioning and piercing, phlebotomy and venous bleeding, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows and similar objects: and everything in its proper place, divided into forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Third Chapter. Of restoration and dislocation, and treatment of twisting, and similar cases: and everything in its proper place, divided into forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.

Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	About the use of cauterization and its effects, and which complexions it suits, and when, and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	However, before that, it is necessary to say the nature of the wounds and the effects of cauterization of its own, and in which complexion it is shown.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say that the speech about the nature of the wound caused by cauterization and its effects is a long and subtle one, knowledge, and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Even a multitude of wise men have spoken in it, and they have disputed in it, and for me, it is enough a little from their words, fearing the prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I declare that cauterization is effective on all wounds, whether with matter or without matter, except for two wounds: the hot wound without matter and the dry wound without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, in the hot and dry wound with matter, they have disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that cauterization is harmful in that case.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	However, others have said that cauterization is not suitable for the disease which is caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is hotness: and it is unsuitable to heal from a hot and dry disease with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	He who says the opposite has said that a wound is made by cauterization in all hot and dry diseases that occur in the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of man and his humors to the fire, you find the body of man to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	I also say by his words: because I have already found that through experiment this will happen again.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	Nevertheless, it does not belong for him to come upon that, unless he has already proven it and been exercised in the chapter of cauterization, and has known the diversity of human wounds, and the nature and disposition of their diseases, and their causes and accidents, and the time of their occurrence.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	However, do not fear from other wounds: and especially in cold and damp diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have become familiar with those: and they have not disagreed in the wound with cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And you know, son, that from the secret of the physician's care, with cauterization and the goodness of fire, and over the medicine burning with cauterization, is that fire is simple, whose action does not harm except to the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm any other connected member unless it harms slightly.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of burning surgeons in medicine is indeed detrimental to that which is extended from the limbs: and perhaps it even causes difficulty in the treatment of difficult disease in a member, and perhaps it even kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	However, fire, due to its own subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do this unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Indeed, we have not yet learned this from experiment, due to the length of practice and study with the art, and the station on the truth of things: and for that reason I excuse the length of my speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if there were not, because it is not allowed for me to bring this secret and hidden thing about fire to you in this book, and the quality of its operation in bodies, by which it expels diseases that are demonstrated by philosophical speech, which disturbs your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know you, O sons, that you yourselves disagree in the time when it is most convenient to make a cauterization, and they set a better time for my lesson.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is convenient at all times, because the hurt that happens by the time is swallowed up in the wound, which is drawn to the cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And above all, if the cauterization is made for the sake of pains that are necessary and hard, and which do not endure delay: because it is feared that from them a greater malice may happen than the small hurt which is done by being late.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not suppose that this thing will not be in your minds, O sons, unless you are vile and stupid physicians, that is to say, that the diseases which are cured by cauterization are not always a return: and they set it down as a consequence, and things are not as they think: because cauterization is not but in the place of medicine, which alters the complexion, and dries up the humors which are causes of the pains, wherefore the pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Indeed, the cauterization aids the healing process of its own disease, and the strength of its own operation, and the power of its master's dominion: and it is possible that the illness lasts for some time according to the complexion of the weak, and the location of his illness, and the power of his illness: and that it is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and that it is sustained by it in its acquisition from food, and similar ones from their causes, unless an illness occurs in which the cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A slight illness in a member of few superfluities and moisture, such as the tooth cauterization, for pain, and similar ones, is possible that it does not last in that one pain.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But my speech is again a matter of delay, that cauterization is the last of medicine: not what they intend in it: for they believe that there is no cure which confirms with the medicine, nor with another after the occasion of the cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the matter is contrary to that, and the intention, that cauterization is the last of medicine, is not, unless when we administer modes of cure in some diseases, and they do not confirm those of medicine: then we administer at the end of the case cauterization, and it confirms: then falls out that cauterization is the last of medicines, not according to the intention which the wise and proud physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than with iron, and they did not say it otherwise than for the equality of gold, and the sublimity of its own substance: and they said that it does not make a pus place in the cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	Indeed, it is not absolutely true: for I have already proven this, and found that it does not make it in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization, when used alone, is beneficial, and better than when iron is used, as they have said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	Indeed, when you use fire for cauterization on gold, it does not appear to you when it is heated according to the amount you wish, due to the redness of the gold: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add above it further heat, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls away from that and is replaced by one who does it better and more easily: and therefore we use cauterization with iron here, which is more suitable for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	Indeed, I have already ordered this chapter on cauterization, according to the previous one: and I have ordered them from the head to the feet: so that those who seek it may find what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	¶ About the method of cauterization of the head in a circular band.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization is applied to the dominion of moisture and coldness over the head: which are two causes of soda, and the multitude of fluids from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and the multitude of dreams, and pain of the teeth, and pain of the throat: and generally all diseases that happen from coldness, such as paralysis, and soda, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and like these from the diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is, to treat the patient as follows: so that he may vomit in the first place when the head is uncovered and cleansed with a mild medicine three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient and his age, and habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then he commanded him to make a cut across his own head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then place him facing you, so that he places his own hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the base of your thumb on the base of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Therefore, if his middle finger bends, mark that spot with a thin line.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then heat the cauterization of olive oil: whose form is shown here.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it directly on the marked spot with a thin line, using a gradual descent so that you can gently clench your hand around it and roll it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then gently pull back your hand and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see already that the amount of bone in the head is decreased or the amount of flesh, then pull back your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, you will pull back your hand with the same iron, or with another that is frozen: until the bones that I told you about are seen.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from the salt, dissolve it in water, drink it yourself, and place it on the spot, and leave it there for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the buttermilk drunk on top of it over the spot, and leave it there until the scar burns away with fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with the ointment Tetrapharmacons, until it is cured.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have already said that the more of the finger remains open, the more pus is emitted: therefore it is better and more inflamed.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and the cauterization should be held until it becomes somewhat thick with bone.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is cut after that which is hardened from the bone, and then it is cured.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	They say that others, it is necessary that when cauterization permeates to the end, until it imprints in the mouth an impression of lead, so that the head falls down, like the form of a chisel: or the instrument that women put infused with the large alphabet: and they consider that they exhale from this place vapors of the head, and the elbow is released for a long time open.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated, until it is consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	However, I do not recognize these two kinds of cauterization at all, except in some men according to the fear of man.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And let it be released, with my health it is better with his own.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head is weakened from the solution of its continuous natural nature: as we have testified in other parts: and especially when the head is weak and feeble, the nature: and indeed the first kind of cauterization is more gentle and better with me, and I use it: therefore operate with it in health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	¶ About the method of cauterizing the head in the pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When in the whole head there happens chronic pain, and it is prolonged in the weak, and it is used with plasters, and needles, and head purgatives, and oils, and emplastered things.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if the cauterization has already been done with the cauterization we have mentioned, and it does not give anything to it from them: then consider it.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is weak from the nature of creation, and it is not feeble, and it finds coldness: then cauterize with another cauterization less there under.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over all the horn of its own cauterization, do not pierce the skin, and it should not excavate from the quantity of bone that we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And he should cauterize himself with one burning iron on the back of his head, in the place which is called the eye. And this is a place where the wound is located, and you will cut off your bone there, and do not break your skull.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the weak man finds this painful due to that intense pain, and different from the pain of other head burns.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I say this cauterization is in its proper place: and it must be a cauterization where the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head with a softer cauterization, where the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is the form of him.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	¶ About the method of cauterization in migraines, both when the medicine is burnt, and when it is made of iron.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When the pain and soreness is in a part of the head, or it extends to the eye, and the face becomes wet with the medicine washing the head, and the remainder of the treatment is given as I said in the divisions of the disease, and it does not all fit together: then the cauterization in him is in two ways: either with a hot medicine burning, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But when the cauterization is with a hot medicine burning, it is like this: take one tooth, and cut it out, and cut off the ends of its two sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then divide the painful place at the time when the phlebotomist makes a wide cut, until there is under the skin a place where the tooth can catch.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore insert it into the same place under the skin until it is hidden: then tighten it above it with a gentle constriction, and let it stay for fifteen hours, then dissolve the tooth, and remove the alien, and leave it for two or three days, or four: then put a submerged belly on it, until the place becomes pussy: then care for it with ointment until it is cured.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	If you wish to perform this with some of the medicines that I have mentioned as burning in the twelfth book of my treatise on medicines for the Middle Ages.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization, however, is done in this way.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The form of the cauterization is as follows.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	It is called the Clauilis: for its form is like that of the scalp, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle there is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it directly on the spot and hold your hand: and you will rotate the iron slightly with force: and the amount that is burned will be from the thickness of the skin, as in the middle of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand, so that the artery beneath is not burned and the flow of blood is not obstructed.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then drink the ointment in salt water and place it on the spot for three days, then place the ointment with butter, and then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish to cauterize this half-crane with the second extremity of the Cauterization iron.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And take care not to cut the artery in this half-crane, not in the proper sense.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	¶ In the method of cauterization in the old half-crane.
Caput V.	5. Head.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating the half-crane, with what we have said in the preceding treatment and with the division of diseases, and not with the curing: and you see from the disease that it is not enough for him that we have said in the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then it is necessary to make the Cauterization iron hot until it becomes white after the signs on the spot of pain with the line, whose length is the middle of the digit, or as if this were: and place your hand on it carefully once, and tie it until you incise the artery and press up to the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	Indeed it is necessary for you to prevent the continuation of the jaw, which moves during mastication, from becoming inflamed on the side, or the nerve that moves it, from causing a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this is for the care and caution of the artery that has been excised.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	In the excising of it, there is fear, and especially him who does not know what it does, nor is eager, nor experienced: and he lets the operation be done with that first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I also remember when the regulation of the flow of blood from the artery according to its own mode, and in its place in this book, happened.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the patient's illness, that this cauterization is not sufficient for him, and if you see a weak body enduring the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have mentioned, then care for the elbow until it recovers.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer this cauterization that we said in the chapter of the extraction of the artery with the cauterization having two hammers.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cauterization is better and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	§ About the method of cauterizing in painful ears.
Caput VI.	Head VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When there happens pain in the ear from cold, and it is cured with dissolved things, and the remaining cure that we have mentioned in the division, and it does not remove the pain, then with fire cauterization: and this is what is called the point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the points with it after its burning around the ear, as it rotates: or around both, if the pain is in both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And stretch it with the cauterization at the root of the ear as much as you can after seeing the places with the burning: and the quantity of the cauterization should be ten points in all the ear, and almost that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then attend to the location, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	In the method of cauterization in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture which is practiced with cauterization, is not but from those species which happen from phlegm, according to what we said in the division of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And she also mentioned the species of cauterization which happens from dryness, and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you are treating this species of torture with ear-drops, and purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the weak one with three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear, and a second rather lower than usual at the time, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And then place your cauterization on the opposite side of the weak one.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For hardening does not happen, unless in the part which appears to be healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of the cauterization is, that it cauterizes itself with Cauterization in direct contact with the upper extremity of the ear, sub-cornu of the head, quite: and another at a different time: whose length is according to the length of the finger.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And lay your hand with the cauterization, until the quantity of the denseness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cauterization, and it is a species from the knife, whose form was mentioned before: verily it is not too fine, as you see: and it is necessary for it to be a knife with a superfluous bulk quite.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then attend to the location, with that which precedes: until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	In the method of cauterization in old stroke.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes old, and when you treat it as we said, and your treatment does not agree with it, and it does not have a fever, then cauterize it with four cauterizations over all the horn of its head, and a cauterization in the middle of its head, as we said, and a cauterization in the back of its head, according to what precedes: and the mode of cauterization should be according to what precedes.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Even it is cauterized with cauterization over the stomach's cheek: and it is the lastest of all.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then it is treated, according to what precedes.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shake the head of the weak one all over, and place on top of its occipital bone the plaster described in the treatise on plasters: and place it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For it is the mode of cauterization: and make it according to the same order that I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If then it is cured by this, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make three cauterizations in the back of its head, which are going from the top of its head to the lower part of the eye: and place between all the cauterization the size of the finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cauterization according to what precedes.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you want an addition, and it is enduring that one: then make for it a cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you want an addition: then cauterize it on two horns.

Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary to proceed with the cleansing of the head with iodine, and as we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then gently rub the weak head: then cauterize it with cauterization in the middle of the head, and cauterization on all parts of the crown, and cauterization on the three following parts of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	However, if you need for the mollification of the body in many of these, and the weak endures it, and the disease is strong: then cauterize it with four cauterizations on the back of the neck, and the last with cauterization, until it burns from the most of its cuticle, and tear off your hand.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, it is necessary to clean the brain of its head with iodine first, and then with the remaining care that we have mentioned in division, when the head is large or endures the reception of drugs.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	However, if the child is who does not tolerate drugs, then a gargle and mouth wash are given to clean the brain before many days with good food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then gently rub the head of it, then cauterize it with a single cauterization in the middle of the head, according to the method that precedes: and with another cauterization on the back of its head, and over all parts of the crown of his own cauterization.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is superfluous descents into melancholy, and the body is a wet one, then give it power to cleanse its brain according to what precedes in division, and then scrape the wet head, and afterwards make a decent linen bandage like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it on the middle of the head: and the feeble one sitting squarely is held by all parts.

Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this to the feeble one once a week when the remaining good regimen of it is ended, until it is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you will, cauterize it by making small points in it as much as possible, except that you hold your hand with the cauterium: indeed it is pleasant-smelling.

Then cauterize him twice over two intervals, if the descent of water is delayed in both eyes at once: or from the side, if the descent of water is delayed in one eye: and cut away all the eyelids and arteries that are under the cheek, and let the cauteries be long in breadth: and guard against the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	That is, if you see something from it, then cut it away immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will repeat with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting, and guarding against the flow of blood.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the ancient tears of the eyes are frequent and are above the eyelids and the arteries that are in the manifest cheek outside, it is believed that this is due to excessive cold and phlegmatic humors: then cauterize with the same cauterization that I will describe in the delay of the descent of water, with the cauterization in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations over two intervals, and two cauterizations in the scalp under two bones.

And if you wish, cauterize it above two eyebrows with two cauterizations in all parts: and they will lengthen by two times: and the length of the cauterization should be according to the length of the eyebrows: and do not finally extend your hand with the cauterization, but according to the amount that becomes third eyelid.

Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either with fire, or with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cauterization with fire, order the weak man to go before that, so that he may let go of his hairs, if any of them are covered by them, until they become long and grow again.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If however they prick him at his own point: then bind his eyes with a thread, so that they may not move, until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are born and open their eyes, then place the weak head in your side: then make signs on the eyelids of his eyes with a burning iron, according to the figure of the myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a drunken whey on the white part of the eye: or on the silky mucus over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then make a cauterization, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize on the figure which you have gradually made in many eyes, until the surface of the skin is completely burned, as the figure of the myrtle leaf appears truly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of your healing work is: if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted, and the hair shaved at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then shave your hand, and release it three days later.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place on it a whey with honey, until the scar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any hair remains after the hour, and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cauterization on that place, as you have done at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If the hair is at the bottom: then cauterize it itself, until it grows to its natural place: and let it be as if it does not prick the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as if you were making the patient weak, so that he may let go of the hair, until they grow and appear.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	The shape of the myrtle leaf from a paper sheet.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from soap known, and from a shoe not saturated, one pound of weight, or almost that: then grind it all at once with good contrition, and make it with haste, so that it does not fail.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take from the dough that you made as the shape of the myrtle leaf, and place it directly on the eyelid of one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a dampened wool, in the albumen: and let the weak head be in your groove.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your finger over the medicine, and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And move it as often as you feel the weak tingling of the medicine, because its tingling is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While he persisted with this that he found the tingling, then let go of the medicine, and press it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the tingling is at rest, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider if you see the eyelid rising, as it rises with the contraction like fire, or with incision, it is well: and if not, then try again over it from the medicine at that place, where the medicine does not press, and does not deny, until your operation is equal, and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place over it the wool with butter, until the fire-scarred skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment of diaphoric unguent, or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you at the operation, to keep the last care, lest something from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	That if the eyelid is softened after a day, and something from the hair clings to the eye, then try the medicine again over that place which you softened with the eyelid properly, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it itself, until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And you know that the eyes of humans are diversified in size and proportion.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to this, your consideration is: and not hidden is the desire for the rightness of that, which is sought in this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	¶ About the method of cauterization in the tear duct.
Caput XIX.	Head 19.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you are treating the tear duct fistula, when as we said in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not agree with it: then, it is necessary for you to cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Please advise the patient to place his head in your groove, and hold his head with his own hand in this way, so that it does not move, nor does he move with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place the infused cork in the eye socket, or in the siliceous ointment on the eye of the patient: then heat the cauterization, whose form is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be thick, as the form of a feather of a quill wants, with which the cauterization is made: and if you want it to pass through to the other end, and if you want it to rise thus, try.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	Nevertheless, this thickness is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and take out from it healthy matter, and scrape it: and if it is not open, then open it, and take out the pus of it.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place on it then the cauterization that is made hot gently.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold it with your hand as much as possible near the cauterization between the eye and the nose, so that your hand does not slip, or the weak one is disturbed: and place the cauterization in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If then you are careful at the beginning of Cauterization from the beginning to the mouth, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then do Cauterization once, or twice, if you need that: and let that be three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then put on the poultice with honey, and care for it with the dried ointment until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If however more than forty days have passed and it does not heal: then put on top of it sharp medicine for the corrosive ulcer, until the mouth is exposed: and rase it according to what comes in the chapter of it.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another way of Cauterization fistula, which some at first said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Understand to the place of the fistula, and find it: then put in the same fissure of the skin with a thin needle, that is, a thin cannula whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour in it the quantity of a drachm of lead melted, and hold your hand with a good retention of the needle, and do not tremble at all so that it does not run, or drip the melted lead to the eye of it.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you put on top of the weak eye a poultice soaked in almond milk or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For the lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it by a miraculous cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed, with what we said from Cauterization and cure, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to make a nostril opening and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what it wants in its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	¶ About the way of Cauterization in the fissures of the Lips.
Caput XX.	Chapter Twenty.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Many times, fissures in the lip are called "pilus," and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When you treat these fissures, when you consider what we have said about the division of diseases, and the treatment does not heal, then a small cauterization knife, in this shape, should be used.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And its cure should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place the hot knife quickly into the fissures, until the cauterization reaches the deep fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the heat, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	¶ Method of cauterization in the mouth fistula.
Caput XXI.	Chapter Twenty-One.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs in the root of the gums, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and bursts: afterwards, it becomes suppurated and the pus runs and forms a fistula: then care for it and its treatment does not heal, then it is necessary to use hot cauterization according to the amount that is taken in the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the hot knife into the fistula opening and hold your hand, until the heated knife reaches the deep part of it and its end: do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then care for it after that, until it heals according to what we have said about the treatment.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If then the pus is cut off and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the rotten bone according to what does not want to grow in its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	¶ Method of cauterization in the gums and softened teeth.
Caput XXII.	Head XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the ginger is softened due to moisture, and the teeth are moved, and it is treated with medicines, and does not fuse: then place the weak head in your side seam.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then make a cauterization of the form which will become soft after this, so that you can place the cannula on the tooth: and quickly insert the heated cauterization into it: and hold your hand for a moment, until the weak tooth feels that the heat has passed to the root.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And scrape your hand: then repeat the cauterization as many times as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then fill the weak mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour: and spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth is strengthened, and the softened ginger is held together, and the moisture is dried out.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	¶ About the method of cauterization in tooth pain.
Caput XXIII.	Head XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the tooth pain is due to coldness, or there is coldness in the tooth itself, or it is frozen, and the treatment does not heal with medicines: then the cauterization is in the tooth itself in two ways: either with honey, or with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	However, the cauterization of it with honey is as follows: take honey in a mortar and mix it with vinegar, and heat it in a lead pot, or in a pan.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a piece of wax, and apply it to the end of the tooth.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse it in the heated vinegar: and place it quickly on the painful tooth, and hold it for a moment until it strengthens: then repeat it several times until the heat of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	If you wish, immerse a thread or a piece of cloth in cold butter, and place it directly on the tooth that is aching: then place a heated iron on top, until the heat reaches the depth of the tooth's root.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	However, when the heat is applied to it, as you would to a copper or iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And there should be some bulkiness in the body of the tooth, so that the heat of the iron does not penetrate the weak bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply the cauterization, whose form is to be avoided: and place it directly on the tooth: and hold your hand there, until the cauterization has hardened.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be relieved, either on the same day or on another.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary for the impression of that cauterization to fill the weak bone of the tooth, and hold it for an hour: then withdraw it.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cauterization.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Apply the cauterization wherever you wish, according to what is possible: and this is the form of the tube.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	¶ About the method of cauterization in Strophuli.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When the Strophuli are cold and wet, and are not easily digested by means of drugs, and you wish to digest them quickly, then apply the cauterization with this form:
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that the smoke can pass between the cauterization and the other end: and place the heated cauterization on top of the gum, and then, if necessary, twice, until the heat reaches the depth of the gum.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the gum is small: then place the cauterization according to the size of the gum.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Afterwards, release him for three days, and place a cloth soaked in butter over the wound, until the burned part is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then care for it with toothpaste, until the form of the cannula heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	¶ Method of cauterization in rancid oil and congestion of cold.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When moisture is removed from the lung tubes, and especially when it is with cold complexion, then it is necessary for the weak to be emptied first with the help of soluble medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it in the throat at the root of the gullet in a depressed groove: and be careful not to cause ulcers with cauterization to the gullet, nor in the skin, unless some of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cauterization at the joint of the neck at its end to the spine of it: and let the cauterization be a clasp according to the way which precedes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which precedes, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	¶ Method of cauterization in lung diseases and cough.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and lung disease are caused by cold moisture, and the weak does not have a fever, nor phthisis, nor old age: then cauterize it with two cauterizations above the girdle in depressed and loose, wet places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And let another cauterization be made in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cauterization be a cannula according to the way which precedes.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish your cauterization to be piercing with the cauterization called Punctum, which has the form that precedes in the pain of the ear: and let the piercings be from thirty to almost another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then, take care of it yourself with what has gone before, until it heals.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now the cauterization has three branches, according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Why is the cauterization supposed to be done at the same time as the one you are doing with your finger, when you do three Cauterias?
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	¶ In the method of cauterizing in the elbow, in the case of a dislocated shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the thumb is dislocated due to moisture and does not show in the hour of its return to its place, until it becomes used to the return, then it should be dislocated by a small movement, as we have already mentioned, and then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then, the weak one is raised up on its back or over the sound side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then, raise the skin that is in the inner part of the elbow with the fingers of your left hand and if the dislocation is jointed to the inner part.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then, the cauterization having two vertices is lit.
Cuius forma est haec.	Its form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then, the cauterization should be applied to the skin until it penetrates it to the other side and the figure of the cauterization with four cauteries becomes smooth.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes a cauterization is made with a cauterization having three vertices, and then the figure of the cauterization becomes six times larger, and they are vertices according to their fineness.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of the cauterization having three vertices.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added to this mode, and then there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then, place over the cauterization the contracted thighs with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then, make the weak one calm down so that the member does not tremble at any time until it is strengthened.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	If the dislocation is to the upper part, and this happens rarely, then cauterize it directly on the shoulder with a cauterizing iron, or by multiple cauterizations with a cauterizing instrument.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	The joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: the weak one is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Regarding the method of cauterizing the stomach:
Caput XXVIII.	Head 25.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When there occurs in the stomach cold and much moisture, until it is extracted from its case, and many catarri are poured on it, and constant methods of treatment are applied, and it does not confer: then it is necessary for the weak one to be placed on the back of its own shoulder, and its legs to be extended, and its hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, with a cauterizing iron of the size of a single finger's tip under the cochlear pectoris, and two cauteries below on the two sides of the first cauterization, until the figure of the cauterizations becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And stretch them apart between each other, when they form pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cauterization should be that of two thirds of the skin's thickness.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And the figure of the cauterizations should be according to this shape without addition: and if you want to cauterize with a large cauterizing iron in the middle of the stomach according to this shape, then the cauterization should be one according to the figure of a circle according to this shape.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by piercing it with a point that is feared from this cauterization: and it is, that signs on the stomach are made according to the quantity that you want to use when you encaustro: then the stomach is cauterized with the point of the cauterization: then care for it with the care that precedes until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On the manner of cauterization of cold iron.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When a pain occurs in the knee from coldness and moisture, or from gross excrement, until it escapes from its natural complexion, and the weak is treated with what I said, and does not progress in that: then it should be cut off above the cauterization, and three lines of cauterization according to this figure, and the same quantity below the knee, where the urine exudes from the human thigh: and there should be a space between every cauterization according to the size of the finger: and the cauterization should be according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand with the cauterization much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And the quantity that is burned from the thickness of the skin does not add to its median part: and the weak stands upright on his own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	However, if it is not standing, then it should be lying down, who has already extended his legs and has raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of cauterization.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is possible for you to cauterize this cauterization with a sharp and skilled knife, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And take care not to ultimately proceed in cauterization, and the thickness of the skin is burned throughout, because the whole body is burned, and it exudes into the intestine: for the skin is there thin, so you know that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the manner of cauterization of the Epaplaxis.
Caput XXX.	Head XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an exit occurs, and you want to know if it is an abscess of the flesh of the knee or of its covering: then if it is in the flesh of the knee, it pains the weak with cold and dullness without acuity: and if it is in the covering of the knee, when there is pain, there is sharp heat without dullness: and you see now that the doctors of this patient have exhausted their strength in its cure.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It must then be that the weak one lies down on his own bandage.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then, the figure of the place with wax: then the burnt cauterization that is similar to the edge.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And it cauterizes with that cauterization one until the whole skin burns, and then seeps into the siphon, until all the sweat flows out: then care itself is cured by its own healing.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it should not be used in this way of cauterization unless the student's desire in the art of medicine is prolonged: and for whose hands are present such afflictions with experiment: then should he dare upon such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But at his releasing it, I find better here.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	¶ About the method of cauterization in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Caput XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that the cauterization with the roots of Aristolochia to pleurisy cold was made in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you receive from the dry long roots of Aristolochia one longer root, which is found in it, and it is like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with the cauterization one in it that is between the continuity of the knee with the neck, and two cauterizations parius under the guidezi with little declivities to the part which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauterizations also in it that is between the fifth and sixth ribs to the posterior almost: and one cauterization in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauterizations from the back: one in it that is between two spoons: and two cauterizations from the two sides of the chest, lower cauterization that is between two spoons.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	It does not become you to hold your hand with the cauteries, rather it should be clear smelling skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	Some ancient ones have said that out of humans who use cauteries made from similar metal rays: and they burn them, and thrust them inside the belly, until it comes to the apostema, and issues forth with pus, as we say in the apostema of Epagathus.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this puncture with the cauteries there is fear, that either a weak one dies immediately, or it happens in the place of the fistula, which is not cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	¶ About the way of cauterizing the Liver Head, XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are treating the sickness of the liver, when it is not the cure that is causing division among the diseases, then the cauterization is on it in three ways, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is, that you make three cauterizations, or four, by lineing according to the length of the liver according to the figure of the cauteries of Epagathus, which precedes the figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And it should be between all the cauterization the quantity of the finger size, or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And it should be the method of the cauterization that we say in the cauterization of Epagathus equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not hold your hand with the cauteries: and it should be a weak one hanging over the back of its own.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of the cauterization is: that the cauterization having two flames, which we say in the chapter of dislocation of the shoulder: and burn the skin which is in direct to the liver, where the weak side of the thigh falls: and your eleua should be such that the eleuation of the skin according to the length of the body, so that the cauterizations fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two blazing hot wires into the skin from opposite sides until they penetrate to the other side. Then extract the caustic: thus four caustics are formed.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a different caustic, use three wires.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the caustic after you have released it to emit pus over many days: for it more rapidly concurs with the following remedies of the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	¶ The method of cauterization in Hydrocephalus.
Caput XXXIII.	Head XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The caustic does not fall in Hydrocephalus, unless it is properly bitten.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are curing Hydrocephalus with the methods of cure that we mentioned in the division, and it does not concur with the cure, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four caustics around the umbilicus, and one caustic over the stomach, one caustic over the liver, one caustic over the spleen, and two caustics post dorsum between the spines, one in directo pectoris, and another in directo stomachi: and the depth of the caustic should be near to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then release the open caustic so that it emits pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not release the weakness from the cure after the caustic, because it is necessary that two intentions gather to it: and it will hasten to the healing with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the caustic with which the belly is cauterized should be a plug: according to which form precedes it: and its form with which the back is cauterized should be an ointment according to which form precedes it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	¶ The method of cauterization of the feet and limbs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XLII.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are about to be baptized in the hydriatic and are replenished with blue water: it is necessary to cauterize on the sole of the foot, which is between the auricula and the annulus: and take your hand with the cauterization, and do not twist it at all: then take your hand again: and do not move it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the blue water to remain, and the cauterization should be in this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauterizations on the two thighs, and let the cauterization be at the end of the sword of the cauterization: and let the cauterization be according to the length of the thigh, one under the knee, and one below it, about in the middle of the thigh: and over all the stomach make two cauterizations: and release the open cauterization without long care: so that some water remains from it: then care for it with the others that I have mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	¶ About the method of cauterizing in the solution of the belly.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XLV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the belly is made from cold and moisture, until the virtuous and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines are weakened and relaxed: and it is cured according to the methods of curing, and is not healed: and you see the feeble one enduring the exudation of the virtle powers, then cauterize it with a large cauterization on the stomach itself, according as was done in the cauterization of the belly with the circle-shaped cauterization, and four cauterizations around the navel subtle ones, with a subtle closure cauterization: and the cauterization over the scutum above the eyes or two cauterizations.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see the exudations of moisture, and the feeble one enduring it, then cauterize it with a cauterization on the chest, and with a cauterization on all the thighs: and perhaps add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the great one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	This is indeed a progressive treatment, whose ingredient does not deceive.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	¶ Regarding the method of treating hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Caput XXXVI. (Head XXXVI)
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When hemorrhoids, old or new, single or multiple, are found in the anus, and are caused by humors that are cold, dry, or corrupted with moisture, they should be treated with the same division, and the curative method does not agree: in this case, cauterization should be performed with three cauterizations on the lower back of the spine, just above the ribs, and a cauterization under the navel, as if made with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that the stomach of this person is cold, and his food does not digest, and you see his face about to bleed, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization, according to what precedes: also cauterize on the spleen, and on another part of the liver, with the cauterization closed: then leave the open cauterization for some time, and then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	¶ Regarding the method of cauterizing an abscess after its formation.
Caput XXXVII.	Caput XXXVII. (Head XXXVII)
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you are about to abscess an abscess, then use a hot cauterization that is similar to the radius.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the hot cauterization into the abscess: and your last hand, until the cauterization reaches the opening of the wound, through which the blood runs: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If then the abscesses are many, then cauterize each one according to what we have mentioned.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for it with the ointment that agrees with them, until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	If you cauterize him with great fire over tin, it is more final in the operation.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	The method of cauterizing an anal fistula is...
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the feeble does not submit to the section and operation that we have described in its place, and is afraid of it, it may be cured by cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When a fistula occurs in someone and becomes old, pus runs from it, and the corrupted moistures run out.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, it is more proper that you should try to open it with gentle trials.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the depth of its penetration when you try.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then heat the cauterization iron that is similar to the ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself, heated, into the fistula and the quantity by which you entered is closed.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cauterization on it until all the corrupted bodies burn, once, twice, or three times, according to the quantity necessary for your case.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And protect yourself from the dryness of the nerve, if it is there, or great vagina: or if the fistula goes to the dry body, or to the dry intestine, then protect yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a dry place: and think that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it is cured.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is closed, and the materials are removed from it, and it remains for a long time: then you know that it has been cured completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if they do not remove the material from it, then you know that it is penetrating, or there is a dry opening in its depth, or something like that: whose remembrance will not be in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	The method of cauterization for the Rhine.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When a pain occurs in the Rhine from cold or from large excrement, and weakness is caused by it, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the almentum over the same renes, with cauterization over all the renees with the same cauterization, whose predecessor is rememoration.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we should cauterize it a second time in the same almentum.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Because three lines appear.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, there will be more in the application.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	The method of cauterization for the vesica.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the vesica from cold and moisture, until the urine does not hold firm, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the inferior part of the thigh over the vesica, where the hairs begin to grow woolly, and from the right thigh and another from the left, and its length according to the quantity of the pollicis nail: and cauterize it with cauterization on the back of the inferior thigh or with two cauterizations if you need that, and it should be according to what precedes the remembrance.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	The method of cauterization for the matriculum.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the matriculum, which prohibits impregnation, and the menstrua are corrupted, and the excitement of them is delayed, and a pain occurs at their approach, then it is necessary to cauterize it with three cauterizations around the umbilicus, as I said in the cauterization of the vesica, and with cauterization on the lower back of the thigh or with two cauterizations: and it should be according to what precedes the remembrance.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	The method of cauterization of Ancham in case of dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When humidities of the mucous membrane are exuded to the point of Anchae, and cause its exit from its place: and this is the sign which is prolonged above another, when they are compared to be inserted: and the location of the dislocation is found to be in it, when it is empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the weak point on Anchae with a similar circle of cauterization: after you have seen the signs when encausted in the circumference of the mucous membrane, as it revolves: and let it fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cauterization be of that form which precedes in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cauterization is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, with a large olive oil cauterization: and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The method of cauterization in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When there is pain in the mucous membrane of Anchae, and the cause is cold and humidity: and the weak one is cared for with that which we said in division, and the treatment does not agree with it, and it becomes old: then it is necessary to dissolve the weak one from the thick fluids with pills bitter or artificial, and such.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	The method of cauterization in this is according to two methods: either with the cauterization and medicines that are applied, or with the cauterization and fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cauterization with fire, is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	When one is, it cauterizes on a piece of the ankle of its three triangular cauterizations, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good depth, or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there should be a space that is between all the cauterization of the quantity of the digit: and it should be an olive-shaped one.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	However, when the cauterization is made in the middle over the head of its ankle.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cauterizations?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form precedes in the cauterization of the dislocation of the ankle, one: so that the circle contains the whole ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the density of the skin of the whole.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in Sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the ankle of its own and does not extend up to the thigh and crus.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	However, if it extends up to the thigh and crus, then cauterize it with two cauterizations over the thigh, over the place where the weak one indicates, in which there is pain, and your cauterization over the callous of four fingers to the part that is slightly slier, and it should be a punch.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cauterization should be according to the density of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the weak one indicates that the pain extends up to the toes, then cauterize it at the place where the weak one indicates with the point of the cauterization, three or four or more, if it is needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if the weak one indicates that the pain is under the knee, then cauterize it at the place where the weak one indicates with the punch of the cauterization, one.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And be careful in all your cauterization that you do not finally with the cauterization to this that burns the nerves, or a large artery, and draws through it on the weak one, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	I have indeed seen one and another of them, among those who cauterized above the knee, and finally in the cauterization, and the leg became inflamed until the tumor followed to the foot, and was completely perforated and corrupted throughout, and then the solution of the fluid occurred, and death followed after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If there is pain in two parts at once, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	Indeed, some wise men have said that in the cauterization of anchaea, this is the method of the cauterization.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar one from iron, whose diameter is the breadth of the palm: and it should be at the orifice of its own according to the size of the nail's nucleus, or less perhaps: and within that iron, make another iron.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there should be a space between all the iron according to the quantity of the pollex node: and they should be open from two parts: and their height should be like a node, or two nodes: and make for them manubria from iron appropriate to the irons.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it should be burned in the fire until it turns red and emits sparks, and then it should be placed on a slightly raised anchaea with an infirm side on a healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, it should be cauterized with three round cauterizations in the ice of one.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then release it for three days.

Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says that in this kind of cauterization of the anchaea, we have not used it much because of the fear of its appearance, and for that reason, because we have found a few who expect on it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Indeed, it is from good cauterizations that he finds a place for him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	When the cauterization is made with the medicines that are applied, as you will make two pieces of black leather with holes, in which the door of his porte will descend from the air or iron, and the length of the wall: of whose height there will be two knots, or as if they were themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be space between the two quantities of the thickness of the finger, and they should be open below and above: and it should be that which contains them together, according to this form.

Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of hot water, which is heated with fire almost, and hold it by the time of the hour: and the weak one will endure the mordication of his, and its own burning, for he has found the mordication as if it were fire, until the mordication ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then uncover your hand with the instrument, and take away hot water from the whole of it with sweet water: then release this for three days.

Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Sum the alkali and unburned lime, and take part of one: tritiate both, and put them in a new crucible, whose lower part has a single small hole, according to the amount that enters the radius: then put another empty crucible under the first one: and dip both with alkali and lime from sweet water, which submerges them with one finger: then with your good hand compression compress the crucible: and let it go until the sharp lower part of the other crucible descends.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all that water, and pour it over the other lime: and let it run until it runs out.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be strong and astringent power, which is given in many medical operations and in cauterization of other parts of the body.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the effect of fire on its own.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from medicines there are those which, when they are cauterized widely, and even like this, and melted wax, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed. ¶

Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it was not needed for another treatment, and that it was cured by the water alone, until he mentioned that he may have entered the bath and left it already cured. ¶
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.

Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	However, I do not see that: for I fear that it will ulcerate, and I have already seen that several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	¶ On the method of cauterization in abscesses.
Caput LIII.	Head LXXIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an abscess and it is slow to mature, or because of the excessive formation of it, or because of the weakness of age, when there are few drops of blood, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the abscess: then cauterize around it with many small cauterizations.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then release it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If then you wish to make a puncture with cauterization, then with this cauterization, which is of this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let it be a cauterization from that which follows weakly, so that the course may be clean.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	¶ Method of cauterization in corroding matter.
Caput LIIII.	Head LIV. (Note: This seems to be a reference to the size or weight of the head, but without additional context, it's difficult to provide a precise translation.)
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Corrosion is not except for the decay in the walking member, and it corrodes itself: just as fire eats dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If then you see the corroding in the place which can tolerate cauterization with fire, then with fire cauterization many, small and large closures, according to what suits that place where the decay is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until you erase the total decay, and nothing remains of it deeply.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then release it for three days, and put over the cauterized places ground sulfur with oil, until all eschars are eradicated, and all decay is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then take care of it with the ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If then you see that after three days healthy flesh is generated without decay, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization over that which remains from the places of decay.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corroding is sometimes treated with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	Indeed, it rises from the place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Nevertheless, the cauterization with fire is more favorable to the operation: and I myself have already said that the cauterization of it with sharp medicine in division: take it therefore when you need it here.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	In a manner of cauterization in cases of boils and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This affliction often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: it is a large, filtered wart that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there is indeed a cauterization for these in two ways: one with fire, and the other with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	However, when it is with fire, it is like a pen made of hot coals: it is made from iron, according to the quantity that it contains closed on all sides: and it should have a fine edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the hot iron on the closed part.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then roll the hand with the cauterization around the closed part, until the cauterization penetrates to the depth of the closure: and let it remain for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply the plaster with thinned ointment, made rough with salt: and let it be placed on top of it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with the generated skin ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they do not heal, and many of them occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply the cauterization with hot water to them: and it is like taking a cannula from air, or iron, or from a hard pen: and place it on the closed part, or a thick one.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then draw out a little of the hot water from the cannula: keep your hand, and roll it with the compression of your hand, so that it impresses the edge of the cannula on the closed part, and it finds warm water to the depth, to the closure: and it will be weak for a short time after the application of hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release it, for the tumor will be removed along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do it with one after another, until all those that come from them are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they have been removed, with the ointment that generates flesh from the skin.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	¶ Method of Cauterization in Tremors.
Caput LVI.	Head 66.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone that there is a tremor from cold in the nerve, or from the quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries, or five on the back of the spine, and over all the spine, and in the chest of the one who is cauterized, and over the stomach of the one who is cauterized.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	Indeed, the tremor ceases with the olive oil cauterization, and hastens the health of the cold disease.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	¶ Method of Cauterization for Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Head 67.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes, the filthy materials that are corrupted are expelled from the body of Albathir, that is, the pustules which are formed.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, it is necessary to first, when they appear, to cauterize them over the entire head with a fine cauterization of the myrtle wood, whose ends are burned with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or when the long root of Aristolochia is used.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or when the cauterization with the lentil-shaped cauterization is used.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized, the adenoids are expelled in the beginning according to this method: and they do not increase: and it breaks the superfluities making them, and heals them from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation when phlebotomy is done.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cauterization in the flow of blood from an artery into the thigh.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that blood flows from an artery that has been cut on the thigh, which happens externally, or at the incision site, or at the cauterized member, and similar to these: it is difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When it happens to someone that this occurs, then at once with your hand go to the orifice of the artery and place your thumb on top of it: and hold it tightly until the blood is completely saturated under your thumb and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place the small olive-oil cauterization on the fire and a large number of them: and blow on it until it is burned well.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, whether small or large, according to the thigh and place where the artery has been cut, and place the cauterization on top of it, after which you remove your thumb quickly: and hold the cauterization until the blood is abscended.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled with the thumb removed from the orifice of the artery and the cauterization is extinguished, then take another cauterization quickly, from the cauterizations that are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So you do not stop doing this with one after another until the blood is abscended.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and another evil may happen to the weak one.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop it at that time: especially if the artery is large, unless with one-fourth of a drachm.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or if with cauterization, as I said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	If not extracted, there is no extraction.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	When it is extracted, the ends of its extremities are contracted and blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or when it is bound with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or they may be placed above it according to the property of the medicine which is to cut off blood and be bound with a proper constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	However, he who cuts off its bleeding with a bandage and binds it with linen, or with the arrangement of things burning, and similar things, does not greatly harm him, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If something like that happens to someone and there is no present physician or medicine, then he should start with placing the index finger above the wound of his own vena as we have said, and with a proper constriction, until the blood is seized from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed, with ice-cold water applied over it constantly, until the blood freezes and becomes solid, and shrinks, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, he should consider what he needs from cauterization or from the medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	Part one end.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	About incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	As I have already said in Chapter One, all the diseases in which there is an opportunity for burning with fire and cauterization and the occurrences of these, their causes, and the instruments used, and the forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed this chapter from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter as before: so that it may appear above the seeker of the desired one.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	Before I begin this, it is necessary for you to add that in this chapter, as in the first chapter on cauterization, there is fear.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	Therefore, it is necessary for caution to be greater, because in the operation which is in this chapter, blood often comes with it, with which life is held at the incision, or at the opening of the abdomen, or at the incision for the exit of a tumor, or at the curing of a wound, or at the drawing out of a stone, or at the incision on a stone, and in all these there is fear, and trembling, and death comes to many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	I warn you that it may fall on you in the matter where there is hesitation, for sometimes people fall to you in this art with infirmity.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them is he who is angry with his own infirmity, and death is near to him because of his great anger which he finds from his infirmity and its length.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when infirmity is from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is he who gives his slave to you and tells you with him that he hopes for health, and the infirmity of his is dangerous.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it does not need to be that you consent to him who comes to you from them, whose method is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let our caution be greater than our greed and rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume on anything from him, unless you have certain knowledge which verifies to you what follows a successful and praiseworthy succession.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the care of all your sick, prognosis and indication to that which is convenient for health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	In that very same thing there is for you an aid in the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you guidance and inspiration, for this is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And indeed I have arranged this chapter by chapters, according to which precedes in the chapter of cauterization, from the hair to the feet: so that what you seek from it may be revealed to you and where you ask.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	¶ About the curing of water that is gathered in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You know that this infirmity often happens to children at the time of childbirth: or when the woman tightly grasps the head of the child without causing any pain.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it happens also from an unknown cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed I do not see this disease in others than in children: and for all of them that I saw died, because of this therefore it has pleased me to send the operation on it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I saw a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was magnified throughout the day, until he could not sit on himself because of the greatness of his head's height, and moisture was increased, until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this indeed moisture, is gathered between the skin and the face, or is gathered under the bone above the eye.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in him, if there is moisture between the skin and the face, and the aposteme is small, then it is necessary to make one opening in the middle of the head in the direction of the length: and the length of the fissure is like two nodes, until the moisture flows.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	This is the shape of sand.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If humidity is increased and the aperture is larger, then place these two fissures according to this shape.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if humidity is under the bone, and the sign is that you see openings of the scalp from all sides: and water is absorbed when you compress it with your hand to the inside, and it does not hide from you this: then it is necessary for you to find three fissures in the middle of the scalp, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after making the incision, remove the entire humidity outside.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tie the fissures with bandages and threads.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then anoint it with wine and oil up to the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then dissolve the bandage, and care for the elbow with tentacles, and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not let go of tying the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And drink a little moisture from all dry foods until the member is recovered and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the magnitude of the aperture and the collection of water appear.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is more in the back, or in the chin, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Then ascend with the incision where you see the aperture and the filling of water: and cut it according to what you can.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe that you do not cut the artery, and the flow of blood may happen, and the weak one may die from that flow with the flow of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	¶ Of the incision of the arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When a cataract happens to someone's eyes or heart, and it becomes old and does not recover with the care of doctors: then the last care is in that, the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	When you notice them coming towards you, let your weakest head retreat.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let him tie his weak neck with any cloth he has.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the weak one is beating.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both are those that are behind the depressed ears: and it is rarely concealed, except in some humans.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then make signs with a candle above both: and make an incision on both with a sharp brush, using the incision to touch the bone: and let this be done all around the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert a brush under the artery and make an incision on it towards the upper part with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And the length of the incision should be like two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the weak one is being incised, blood will escape from the pulsating exit, which frequently jumps to the inside.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however, the artery does not appear by touch, then it is necessary to measure the distance from the ear with a space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then make signs with a candle and find up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which must be expelled from the blood is VI uncia, and perhaps you will expel more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of this according to the quantity that appears to you from the weak one and the fullness of its artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider to the knee.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains something from the bone to the mouth, then make an incision on it so that a hot aposteme does not happen: then tie the knee with linen strips from the cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Translation: "Regarding the extraction of arteries that are present at certain times.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old hemicraniectomy occurs in a man, or a sharp cataract due to the acidity and heat of the limbs of the temporals, or an old soda, wet, and similar to these: and it is treated with the methods of the curative art, and it does not agree with this: then we have experienced extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of their edges, as we have mentioned.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	The method of the operation in the extraction of these is, to pluck out the weak hairs that are in the temples, and to direct them towards the apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	Indeed, it is shown to you by its own pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few men, or the severity of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then he tightens his own head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or, if you wish, wet the place with hot water until it becomes manifest to you by a clear appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a sandwich, which we formed a little earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then exfoliate the skin with it, with ease, until the pustules reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then pull out the wool with it, and pull it upwards until you pull it out from the skin, and make it drip through the clothes that are under it from all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is thin, then close it with the end of the wool.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then incise it from that part according to the quantity by which its ends elongate and contract, and there will be no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	If it is not incised and if it is not excised, blood does not ascend insidiously.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then draw out the blood from the vein, up to 6 drops, until 3.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with two strong threads made of silk, or from the almond-shaped tendon, so that it does not reach putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then incise the excess that is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour, or at another hour later.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cauterizing iron up to the mouth, with a kitchen cauterizing iron: until the ends of its sides are incised, and it will remain in the same place of the operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better to do this unless he has a weak fever or a hot complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cauterizing iron is from those that dry out wet things.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to be dried.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the removal of the artery to fill the old cloth place: and they should be laid above on that appropriate one.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And then it is treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to be born, and with liniments until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if in the meantime while you are operating a flow of blood occurs from the artery, then immediately to bind it with cauterizing or to fill the place with zigzag: and tighten your hand until the blood is bound.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	That if nothing of these is present to you, then lay your finger above the place until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And cool the place with strong cold water until the sharpness becomes quiet and tightens according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from it that it is more lethal and easier to extract the artery, it is, as if to cauterize the wound with this cauterization having two knives: for the sharpness of the two knives is similar to that of the magnet.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, their sharpness is much less than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp like the two knives, then cold will come to them: and they do not cut flesh with roughness.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When there is a little coarseness in them, the heat of fire is held in them, and the flesh is cut off quickly: when this is needed, it is better than all other work, and more lethal, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And there should be space between the two knives, the quantity of their fingers, after you have marked out two places with the cauterization: and place them on fire, until they reach the edge, and they come into contact with the wound in two places: so that it may be stretched that is between its extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not become solid with this cauterization.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cauterization.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Regarding the care of the course of sharp, frequent lachrymal tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are frequent and their course is from the outside of the cranium of the head: and it does not mix with anything of the care of medicine with medicines, and you see the face of the weak one becoming red, and he feels on his face as the walk of ants: and his eyes are drooping, moist, so that his eyebrows are already corroded by corrosion: and his eyelids are burned by the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients needed this care for this operation, and called it the care of Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	It is said that one should shave the hair that grows on the face of the patient.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions in the front of the patient's face, approximately equal to two fingers in length, with one incision in the middle of the nose, and another along the movement of the elbow, and a third on the other side. Make sure not to cut any arteries in the two sides. Extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and make sure there is a space for the entire incision of three fingers connected together. Have a piece of sponge ready for you, or multiple dried bandages, with which you can dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the sharp end of a sponge made of two sharp ends, whose next form is as follows.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision made on the side of the eye, to the second incision: and scrape off all the skin that is between the two incisions, with what you cut, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do this as well from the middle incision to the second one.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this sponge, and insert the other instrument called the lancet into the first incision from one side, which is not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	Then place the sharp side of the skin against the examined flesh with the skin, and the lenient side against the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle incision: and cut off all the moisture that comes down from the head to the eyes, except for what is continuous with the incision up to the one that appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do this in the middle incision up to the other one.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after running through the equal amount of blood, express the spots from the pieces of dried blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place a piece of cloth over all the wounds, and pour wine or oil on it, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see if there is no burning aphothema.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, dissolve the ligament and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat that with the balsam of St. John, and the rest of the wounds, until it is cured.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	¶ The treatment for sharp-edged tears and catarrh to the eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When sharp-edged catarrh occurs in someone, be attentive: and see the eyes to be swollen, small, and already weak in appearance: and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs falling from them, and there is a deep pain in the head, painful, and sneezing follows: then take from these symptoms that of the matter, and catarrh does not come unless from many vesicles.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And a better cure is this for them.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is best to have the sick person scrape his own forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make a incision in it, one in the middle of the forehead, or another near the side, and start from the left temple to the right: and the incision should be up to the nose: and extend your hand from the wrists that move during mastication: until when the nose is held: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two incisions between the old cloth or linen bands.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tie it over with the cloth: and pour wine or oil on the cloth to prevent a burning aphothema.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	When you have solved that, and see that the hot pox is about to appear: then it is necessary for you to rub the mouth, until flesh begins to be born in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of it with the treatment that expels the pus: just as if you took two parts from wheat flour and four parts from colloquintida, and prepare an ointment from them and apply it to the birth of the flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	¶ Regimen for when it falls into the Aumen.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls into the Aumen is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or one like a stone, such as iron and copper: or it is from a plant, such as chestnut and sesame: or it is a flowing substance, such as water, vinegar, and those like it: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When then a stone or a kind of stone not added to it grows in the Aumen, expose the Aumen alone: if then you see a stone, then distill something from olive oil or vinegar into the Aumen.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then apply the extraction of it, and make it hiss with condiment, and rub the nose at the coming of the hiss, after you have placed in the circumference of the ear some thorns from the band or cloth, and extended the ear to the upper parts.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this treatment often departs.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not depart, then apply the extraction of it with the Gest, which is Pizigarol subtle: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If then it departs with the Gest, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then apply the extraction of it with a little of the black mustard subtle, repeated several times.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If then he does not pass through this, then make a cannula from air and insert the extremity of the cannula into the opening of the ear to a considerable extent, and wet that which is in the circumference of the cannula with softened oil, so that it does not drip except from the cannula: then withdraw it with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Many times they go forth with him who we have related.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If then he does not go forth in this manner: then take from helkalimbat, or from uisco, that is, prepared flour, with which they take the aues, a simple matter: and put it at the end of the radius after you have placed a decent navel on it: then insert it into the opening of the ear with facility, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If then he does not go forth with all that we have related: then proceed to cut, before the hot apoplexy or spasm occurs, if it occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the mode of incision is to use a phlebotomy knife on the weakest part in the head: and withdraw it from the blood according to its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the weak one sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small incision in the root of his ear at the depressive place of himself: and let the incision be in the shape of the moon: then pull it out until it reaches the stone: then take it away with you, as much as is possible from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then use your incision from your wrist with ease, and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If that which is falling into the ear is from one grain of wheat which is growing and swelling: then give him the extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If then he does not obey you to the end: then take a thin, subtle spumous thing, in this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	Administer this abscission of that kind from the grains which fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think about it that the grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you place the whole grain on the wedges: then extract it with uncini, or with a gentle grip, or with suction, as we have said, for this extraction is wet.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In water that enters the ear, it is necessary to use a weak cough with the condi first: and it has already filled its own ear with somewhat cooked before: and it is lying on that ear, which is in the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If then it goes through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of the finger, thin, soft, and heat them slightly with fire, and insert one of them weakly into the opening of its own ear: and it will drip from one leg of it on its own side, and hit with a stone another stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore do not stop making this with a stone and a stone, until it has gone out all the water.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And it is already going out of the water so that you can take from the pyre, or from the other side, one end and insert the other end into its own ear: and light the other end with fire until it burns much of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another junction, and do this many times until it has gone out all the water: and extract it with the cannula according to what was said on the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that enters into it, if it is a small body like a flea, and similar to it, take care of it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that appears to the senses: then administer its extraction with a grip and wedges: and this is easier for all that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of womb-born children from the ear, when you are careful to follow what we said about division, and in the tract on distillations, and not allow your care to interfere: then it is necessary for you to look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears from the womb, then extract that with your hand, or with fine threads.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however nothing appears there, then take the cannula whose form is as follows: it is strict below and wide above: and insert its subtle end into the ear according to the quantity that it can bear from the weak: then suck with that strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the womb-born children have come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If however they do not obey you to the end, then fill the circle of the cannula with clay, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If however they do not come out with what we said: then administer the distillations which the ancients have already found useful in the removal of womb-born children: and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your flow be such as you pour olive oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see make it as follows: either in silver or in air, below strict, with a small hole above, and large.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it be such that what is in the connection of the cannula, is fittingly made of air.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you will, take the radium, and wrap its end with a cloth fittingly: then press out oil, or gum, or what you will of these medicines into the cannula: and it should be in the ear: then insert the radium with the cloth above, and express it with your hand's compression, until the oil is pushed through the connection heard, and feels weak internally: and that which is poured into the ear should already be hot with fire almost: for fear that something cold should distill into it: for medicines do not endure that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	The treatment of gold disease occurrences.
Caput VII.	Chapter Seven.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Some infants from the wombs of their mothers who are not dilated pass.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some men with opilliation in the meatus of the ear, or with flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this opilliation sometimes happens in a deep opening of the ear, which does not follow use: and it sometimes happens to the outer opening, and follows it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore that which happens in a deep ear, and which does not comprehend the view, is difficult in many ways for the cure.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows use, it is necessary that you place the weak ear in the sun, and look at it: then if you see opilliation appearing, open it with a soft soap, whose form is this, which follows, is its extremity in which there is some small latitude, of which some part is sharp: and the rest of the soap is two sides of soft skin: so as not to hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If opilliation is from the flesh born in the meatus of the ear: then hold it with a thin file, and shave it with ease of the strong, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	And if opilliation is in the deep ear: then take a thin, soft heated wire, and heat it slightly: and then insert it into the meatus of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	And if you feel opilliation with it, which the weak one found with old age, dare to open it with ease: and take care not to wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place a linen in the ear according to the size of the opening which you have healed with Egyptian ointment: and do this for some days until you are secure about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Either accept linen, and pour it into rosy-red water, and sprinkle the finely ground powder on top of it, and use that.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see hair already turned yellow: then it is necessary to take out the linen, and allow another piece of linen to be placed with it, which is soaked in the oil that has been made from rose-water, until it becomes hot: then care for it until it recovers.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, blood flows: then submerge a sponge, or pieces of linen in cold water, and place the hair on top of it: and use the remaining treatment, which is described in the book on distillations, to stop the flow of blood mentioned above.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	¶ About the care of Altheli's eyes.
Caput VIII.	¶ Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Altheli that occur in the eyes are sometimes wet and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, it is necessary to hold them with bandages: or with tweezers, and scrape them with the roots of the same.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place it on top of the ground powder.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If, however, blood flows from them: then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cauterization on them.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many times they return when something remains of the roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	¶ About the care of Grandin's eyes.
Caput IX.	¶ Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens in the eyes that something similar to Grandin occurs in its strength, and its hardness, and for that reason it is called Grandin: and it is a thick moisture on the upper eyelid, and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation then in these is, as you see now, if the Great Proceeding is in it, that appears from the eyelid, and they are moved to all parts, and this is easy for its matter.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find then over this crack by the breadth.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then rub it from all sides with ease, until it becomes smooth.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a thorn, and cut off the same.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if the cutting of it is not prepared for you, unless you pierce the eyelid with the incision almost at once, then it will harm the weak one in some part.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If however the crack is great: then gather it with the stitch: and take care of it until it becomes sound.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small: it will not harm you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment will restore it and make it fat.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the great one is descending to the inner part of the ear through the internal surface: then rub the eyelid, and suspend the hail with a thorn: besides which you need the incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If however the eyelid is extended by the incision: it will not harm it in any part.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the hail of the great one, with salt water: and take care of the place with it that becomes fat, until the weak one becomes sound.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	¶ About the care of the Axiynath eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axinnath is wax which is generated in the upper eyelids' cloths: and it happens most of all to boys: and it grieves their eyes, and cataracts happen to them in the mornings, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because the tears run to them, and for this reason they are used to lie on their faces always, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are always wet under the eyebrows, which have already swollen: and the appearance of Axinnath is apparent in the eye, and when you take a place with your fingers, you feel Axinnath among them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	The method of its operation is that it places the infirm head of its own in your groove.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen bandage and prepare a braid from it, and make a circle of that braid according to the amount of Axcinth contained in it from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top of it and press with your fingers from all sides so that the Axcinth accumulates in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find the moisture in the middle of its incidence with sand and fissures along its length, and do not make a fissure greater than that which is made in phlebitis in the deep part.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it may be necessary to find the entire skin until the swelling of Axcinth through many dispositions of Axirnath from the fissure according to the form of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Then take it out with the linen cloth that you inserted between your fingers to the outside: and you turn your hand to the right and left until it disperses: and be careful not to add to the fissure so that the swelling does not occur with sand in the eye, and hurt it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, add a little with ease so that Axcinth proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then take it out as I have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then dip the linen cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and tie it with threads.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And from men who tell of salt, and place it in the hollow of the fissure so that what remains of that moisture is liquid.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if it occurs at the site of a hot aphthous ulcer, then take care of it with sedative ointments until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Methods for making the eye dull, that is, when the eyelid is softened, whereby it becomes as if it should not redden.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs are added to the eyelids of the eyes beyond their natural position and increase: then they harm the eye itself, and cause certain diseases to occur, such as frequent tearing, softening of the eyelids, and whitening of the eye, until this becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And the dulling of the eyes is treated in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to what was said earlier in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or the dulling of the eyes is treated by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by cannulas, as I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary to place the weak head in your groove.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If then it is turned, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle into it, in which the thread of the lower part of the eyelid is, and make the needle go through the thread with the thread above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs are born: and then pull the thread up with the eyelid and turn it with your hand.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid, under the added hairs, with the saliva incident on the greater tear to the lesser tear.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small piece of cloth or linen: then mark on the eyelid with a candle, which is as the figure of the myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	Indeed, it should be formed according to the quantity and eyelid measurement, for that has already been diversified among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For it is they who require that the quantity be large, according to the one that is softened from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when you find the spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the greater tear to the lesser tear, and make a single fissure near the natural hair, as is the thickness of the radius, so it will be.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the unguent into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then exfoliate the entire one.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather the two lips with the suture, with a needle and fine thread: and wipe away the blood, and make it adhere that which superfluities from the tips of the two eyebrows, with which some things are used, if you want to do this: and if not, do not worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then release the suture and thread up to three days, or four: then care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you want, release the flap without suture, and care for it with it, that it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is edemed at the wound sealing and aggregating of it: but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This manner of treating they taught the ancients.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	Indeed, there is anxiety about the weakest, and it is from good operation, and it is not in this fear.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another mode is also in Ataxmir: and it is, as signs on the eyelid, which is like the figure of the myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then edeme the eyelid with three unguents separated or aggregated according to this form which follows, and then cut that which superfluities with forllocks equal to this form, according to this form.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If it is not possible for you to hold an alligator and it does not match, then take an acupuncture in which the thread is, and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another thread of the thread that is slightly larger than the tear, and the second thread of the thread that is slightly smaller, and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then make your hand equal by eleution: and eleuate the skin over which the cotum is marked, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather two wounds of the lip with the suture: and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If however an apostema happens at your incision or your fissure: soothe this apostema with the caeroto, and those similar, resting on unguents.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelids that they turn the hair of his.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore it is necessary for you to use in it what we have said in the incision, but the suture is more artificial for both of them.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	¶ About the care of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is that you cut the eyelids, and separate the fissure that is thinned, according to what we have said.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make an art of two sticks, or two thin woods: the length of which is according to the length of the eyelids, and the width of its parts is less than the width of the spatumilis: and you have already arrived at the extremities where you hold the threads from both sides.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather both with subtility on that which is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and string two sticks from both parts of the strong stricture, and let it be for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the strict skin dies, and degrades, and putrefies, until it falls by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then it is slow, then cut it with the sickles.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When then it has consolidated, pull up the eyelid: and they will not prick the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two carnelian squares, which the face is made according to this figure, and the quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	¶ About the shaving of the pricking hairs in the eye with a sharp edge.
Caput XII.	Head XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in that is, take a fine needle, and thrust it into the thread of fine silk, gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather the extremities, and the nodes of both knots with fine threads, and let the length of the threads be a palm's breadth.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then compose another fine thread under it, and if you will, a node at the ends of it.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then lay his weak head in your side, and let it be near the sun, because it is a subtle or small operation, as it is declared.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then thrust the needle with the alignment in the root of the eyelid, and make it pierce the eyelid quickly, until it goes out above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair up to the alignment: and thrust the hair into the alignment with the needle: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it, until the hair goes out with the alignment in the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If then the alignment is drawn, and the hair does not go out with it: draw the alignment to the lower part, with the thread which you have composed in it, until it goes out of the upper opening, and see it by the eye: then draw the alignment and the thread: and take out both, and close the eye, and let it be for two or three days, until the hair grows in its place, and bursts on it above.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then associate it with a long hair from natural hair and pluck it together; or release it until it grows after some time, and then pluck it then.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	This is a description of a condition that affects the upper eyelid, which was known as "Alxatrati" in medieval Latin medical texts. The specific treatment or cure for this condition is not provided in the given text.
Caput XIII.	This is a heading for a new section or chapter in a medieval Latin medical text. The number "XIII" indicates that it is the 13th chapter in the book.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this condition, known as "Alxatrati," occurs in the eye, it is called "Leporina." The term "Leporina" may refer to a specific type of eyelid inflammation or swelling.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	This condition, known as "Alxatrati," can be either natural or accidental. The term "natural" may refer to a condition that is present from birth, while the term "accidental" may refer to a condition that develops as a result of an injury or other external factor.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, this condition is accidental and arises from the consolidation of wounds, or cuts, or cauterization, and similar procedures. This suggests that the condition is caused by an injury or trauma to the eyelid.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	The method of treatment for this condition is to find the consolidated tissue, separate the lips of the eyelid, and place a strip of linen between them, and tie it tightly until it heals. This suggests that the treatment involves surgical intervention to repair the damaged eyelid tissue.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	It is not appropriate to use such things as those that dry and contract in the treatment of this condition, because if you do so, the "Alxatrati" will become worse than it was. Instead, use things that have a softening effect, such as Greek fenugreek: mix it with water, in which althea is boiled, and the linen seed: and apply a ointment made of oils, which has been liquefied, and wrap it with the linen, and care for it with it. This suggests that the treatment should involve using natural remedies that have a soothing and healing effect on the eyelid tissue.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	The resources for your treatment are such that you will overcome every attempt to heal, according to the original form. This suggests that the treatment may be complex and require a high level of skill and expertise to achieve successful healing.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	This very operation that I mentioned is indeed a certain correction of Alxatratus, so as not to leave the form of the place according to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Regarding the care of Alxatratus which is done on the lower eyelid, and it is a rugation or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Head XIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatratus which is done below, is what is truly named Alxatratus.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural and accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is made from the elbow, or a fissure, or cauterization, and such like.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And one of the operations in it is, to take a needle, in which there is a thread double, and to anoint it with the skin, and to make it penetrate from the left lachrymal to the right lachrymal, until the thread enters into the two extremities of the skin.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the skin upwards with the needle, and cut it with a blunt edge.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the figure of the eyelid returns according to what is proper, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the radium, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and find two fissures on the inner side of the lower eyelid, and they are the extremities of the two angles of the incision, until they come together and form an angle: until when they gather together, form this figure, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that skin by the quantity of the sharp side of it, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts: anoint them with wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with that which we have said, of the softening medicines and stimulants, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cauterization: then it is necessary to flatten the fissure under the eyebrows, even according to how it precedes.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a stimulant, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the cure of an Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is to let it flow into that operation, according to how it is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is indeed of many varieties in form: and the wise artificer prepares the ingenuity with whatever mode is possible for it, until he makes the figure return to the natural form, or nearly so, and himself also weakens, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	¶ About the adhesion of the eyelid to the eye with conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	At times this consolidation happens to many men, so that the eyelid above becomes white with the eye, and prevents itself from its own natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of the finger under the eyelid and lift it up: or extend it with a finger-nail: then touch the consolidation with a soft salt, which is not like the sharpness of the salt used for incisions, but is more like an almost blunt one: so that the weak one does not feel disturbed during the operation, and removes the salt, and harms the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you were scraping off this consolidation with ease, until when the eyelid returns according to its natural form, and heals the adhesion entirely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Cast the salted water into your eye, after washing it with water: or distill the water itself, from the salt made, from the gypsum dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the skin between the eyelids and the eye with linen thread: and place over the eye a flax cloth soaked in gum ointment: and use it again on the third day, until it becomes solid, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	¶ About the cutting of the nail and the prominence of the flesh tears.
Caput XVI.	Head XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and is similar to hard rubber, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to the cold humidity of white ice: which when it touches the hand with iron, or with a razor, it is cut off, and the razor does not leave a mark on it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And neither of these kinds begins until the tears are greater, until it gradually advances, until it prevents the light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on its cutting is: to place his weak head in your groove.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and separate the skin of his eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then close the nail with a few razor cuts, and extend it to the top.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take the point, and insert a horsehair skewer or a bone into it, and wrap it with silk: and let the thread be strong, and cut the tip of the point almost perpendicularly, and thrust it into the middle of the nail: and pass it through the nail with the thread, and extend it to the top: and remove the hair from the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were combing it up to the end of his eye.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then incise the remaining part of the lacrimal bone with fine sand and/or with small furrows: and release the natural flesh of the lacrimal gland so that it does not occur from the course of its constant flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when it extends with a nail alone: or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it with fine sand, which is in this form.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful not to touch the sand with the membrane of the cornea, and it may cause a rupture in it and pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, pour something salted and crushed into the eye, or from the saline made from a pig's bladder, and release it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is necessary, until it becomes healthy.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not hard and you cannot insert a probe into it or there is no horn in it, then this species of nail is often treated with medicines and becomes healthy as we have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you want to incise it, then open the weak eye, and take fine sand, soft, weak in cutting power, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the nail off above the reason with fineness.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is being burned and cut, and imprinting on it, then distill from your hour into the eye from the saline made from a pig's bladder, or from red saline, or from crushed salt: and moisten the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat on the same operation until the whole of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is something different for you in the eye, hot apostema: then release it and treat the apostema until it becomes healthy.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then perform the operation again on the same part with its respective reasoning, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, the tear duct of the eye, if it causes harm to the eye in a great manner, should be suspended with a safety pin, and an incision should be made from that part of it: and not ultimately the incision, so as not to cause the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then a small piece of red cotton or made from hazelnut, should be placed in the eye until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	¶ About the Alguardenic incision, and the flesh made in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes a red flesh is made or placed in certain eyes of men, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or draws it up over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outside: and resembles the rose of balsam.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation is also done, so that the weak head of your own may be placed in your groove.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open the eyes of those, and close that entire flesh with appropriate safety pins to that: and hold it with one hand, or grasp it.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then make an incision in the flesh at first, until the whole of it is finished with the incisor.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful not to hurt the eye with your operation: and let your incision be the one you make, or with sandpaper that we have mentioned in the cutting of the toe: or with needles, according to which form you wish for it after this cluster.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is completed and the entire Alguardenic removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or distill some red paint, and similar to that from medicines corrosive: and place a piece of cotton over the deformed eye with glass: so that it may be secure from hot apostemates.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If there remains from other wounds something, and the hot blood dominates over you, and you fear the hot apoplexy: then let go of the eye, and care for it with that which soothes the apoplexy.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then you will repeat over it with the operation until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly, make with the flesh added that happens in the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that all weak eyes from one kind of nature or from another accidental kind be cured by operating with iron: and you do not thrust your hand into any of these operations until you see that this member is enduring that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	¶ Regarding the collection of sebum from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebum is red and is woven over the eye, and prevents its own operation: and weakens the eye with the length of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, it is necessary for you at first to see if the eye in which there is sebum is strong, and there is no sickness in it except for the sebum: then collect the sebum of that eye.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is good to prioritize the weak one, so that its head is placed in your groin.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those eyelids with a single or two hairs according to your prudence: and the hair should be a fine doubling of this form, or be two hairs that are graduated in the body one, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those eyelids with fine threads, and wipe the blood hour after hour until you see that these eyelids are withdrawn from the eye, and they become: and be careful not to hurt the eye with the extremities of salt water.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And your operation should be in the midday sun, and you should be firm in your operation: so that you do not fall except for those eyelids.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	When you have completed your application, then distill it into the eye of the affected area, or red: so that its sharpness may consume what remains in itself.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If however it is not possible for you to gather the whole of it at that time, then apply a plaster to the eye with it, which soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it on for some days, until the pain of the wound settles down: and protect it from hot applications: and then repeat over it in the same manner, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the thorn.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Regarding the reduction of Arsenius to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The physicians named Arsenius the fistula, which they treat with cauterization, or with burning medicine, according to what is stated in the following narrative.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no wisdom in it: unless you find on the surface of the wound, and outside, all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it off with the instrument whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the scrapping of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron, and let its head be round like an azir, which is punctuated with a fine line of the lancet, or with a fine line of the chisel: and place it on top of the place of the corrupted bones.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand slightly, until you know that the corruption has been scraped off: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with the dried medicinal ointments.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If then the wound is healed and flesh has been formed, and the discharge of pus ceases: and if, after forty days, it remains unaltered, unopened, without suppuration, and no accident befalling it occurs: then you know that it is cured.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no genius in it, unless the fistula be reduced to the nostril, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is that you remove from the bone either with a hammer or with sharp medicine: and when you have found the bone, then take the wedge according to this form, it should be at the end of the iron, triangular: and the wood of it should be a pyramid diminished to its end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place this over the bone itself: and it should be near the tear-ditch: and extend your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then roll your hand with the wedge, until it penetrates the bone, and feels weak: by this you will find the air to escape from it, when you hold your hand over your own nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, then restore the place with stupefying ointments, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When then flesh is formed and the wound hardens: then the matter that was poured out to the outside returns to the nose: it is therefore weaker above the weak part.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ On the reduction of the prominence of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye projects with all its bulk, and no harm occurs in use, nor diminution: then it is necessary to loosen the weak part: then make a bloodlet at that place: afterwards put on wet dressings without scalding, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place over the eye a liniment made from acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarsaparilla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tie the eye up with the plaster made with many mustard seeds.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of mustard seeds is: take many thin linen cloths, and double each one four times over; make many of them according to the size of the eye; then place them one on top of another according to the amount needed for the eye; then tie them together with a strong cloth bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the waters without scarring with suction.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then take away the waters, and release the tied-up eye both day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the bandage is again softened, then it should be tied up very tightly; then take away the bandage the following day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If you see the eye already dressed with clean linen, that is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, the mustard seeds, the tied-up eye, and the waters until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	¶ About the cutting of the king's linen.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When the linen of the eye is torn, then it should be mended and go out beyond the eyelids like the grain of wheat, and spoil the appearance of man because of this, and it may insert itself: then the operation is done in it as I will tell you: and it is like this: that you thrust an acumen into the root of the linen from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then thrust another acumen into it where the thread is doubled from the watery part, and make it pierce: and release the first according to its own position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then let the thread be inserted at the place of the doubled one, and tie it with that part of the linen around the acumen: and tie it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the eye socket and place a piece of infused linen over it on the alveolus of the eye: and release it, until the thread falls with the king.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the eye with it, so that it strengthens it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the thread is tied around all parts with a circle from linen, until it adds great prominence to the eye.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then let it be washed with fine sand, which reaches the depth of the eye, and moistens the alveolus, and the eye comes down, and enters immediately: then tie it up, until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	¶ About the cure of Alcomnati.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease called Alcomnati is not, except for pus, which is gathered in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the mode of operating in it is, as you make the weak sit on a prepared or directed seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head of it with your hands from two parts, and move it, until you see healthy wounds to heal the lower eyes of yours.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is shaped and does not go down, and the light is released: and the weak sees as he saw: and if it does not go down below, you know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if it is not prepared for the descent of pus with it, which I said, then make the weak sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take fine sand, and find with it above the thin lining of the cornea at the end of the conjunctiva with the corneal layer, until the pus comes down.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And when it comes out, then pour hot water into the eye in which you mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled Greek must and honey: then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water that has descended into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	I have already mentioned the types of water in division, and which are suitable for making a hole in the speech, declare and explain them, then take this same according to its health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the infirm sit with his feet square between your hands, opposite to the light, near the sun: and tie the sound eye of him, and pull it gently: then pull the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye from which the water comes is the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right side.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take your right hand with a cloth, if the eye is on the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right side.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the edge of the cloth near the corona by the size of the radius in the white eye apparent lachrymal of lesser: then pull the cloth with force: and you will roll your hand with it, until it penetrates into the vitreous humor of the eye: and you will feel that the cloth is already wet to the work.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measurement of the cloth be to the depth, the space which is from the pupil to the end of the black part: and it is the corona of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the same pupil vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal layer.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the cloth up to the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it down with your finger one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then the water comes down immediately, then the infirm will see this above what it opens its own eye at once, and the cloth in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then you will rest for a short time.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then water descends, then place it secondly, excluding that it goes to the dung.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When then it is made and does not rise: then take out the dung with ease: and you turn your hand slightly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something in water from clear-eyed stone gem: and wash the eye with it when exhausted.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place all the plaster around the eye, or infused wool with rose oil, and clear eye: and tie the healthy eye to it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and they who are of our time, place over him ground almond with rose oil.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	What if it does not submit to you the dung for entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is hard: then it is necessary that you take Alberid soap, which is called, because of this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, with it, when you are connected to it alone, and not finally with your hand in the hole: and there is no other than to make a light to the subtle dung place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the dung, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the end of the work, prepare an infirm sleeping bed, in which he sleeps on his back in the dark house: and forbid all movements and cries: and place the food of him that lenients its nature: and it will not turn its head to the right or left.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to its own arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark house, and try his sight: and make him see that thing.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament up to the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it should not be done at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather, it should be left to itself, because water rises quickly through a vigorous aspect.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, an inflammation of the eye occurs: then it is necessary to reduce the eye before the seventh day: and then correct that with what soothes the inflammation until it is sated, then remove the same humor from his mouth, and place over his face which is being treated with that humor for those days which are necessary in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should gradually leave the house and be cured in his own cases.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And you know that the student is not excused from sighting a few times in salve: for then he dares to oversee the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And already some of them have come to us who are from Al-Layrach, who said that it was made in Al-Layrach with a perforation, through which water is thought to pass.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Indeed I do not know anyone in your land who made this: nor have I read it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species as they stand on them, which one who knows them does not know.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of proper air: and their extremities should be with this same fine triangular shape, and an acute angle.
Formae magda.	Species of magda.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	§ About the care of the flesh-born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When sometimes these flesh-born are born in the nose, there is something in them which resembles the scorpion of many feet: and from this comes cancerous flesh, lard, and white flesh: and from this comes the soft flesh, not white.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In this, therefore, the soft, non-deceptive, and cancer-free part of these flesh, you should have the weak sit down between your hands facing away, open its nostrils, and pull out the hair from these parts: then take them to the outside, and cut what you have grasped with the soft and sharp foam from one side, until you know that the entire flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains of that from which removal is not possible: then rub that with one of the soft tools with facility, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood dominates over you, or a hot blister occurs: then place it opposite as is appropriate: if it is from the bad blisters, then cauterize it immediately, until the blood is removed, and all the flesh is taken away.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then it should be pushed into the nose after cutting, with vinegar and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it up to the tongue, then you know that it is now healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the moisture does not penetrate, according to what is appropriate, then you know that there is flesh inside the upper bones of the nose, which does not become wet with the cutting instrument during the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is appropriate to insert a thread of linen, which has some thickening and nodes in it, and place the quantity of the digit on each node, or less: and let the weak one take hold of the extremity of one filament with the thumb, or with what is possible, after making it similar to the one he has made for himself: and draw out the sweet one, until it reaches the caassum, and go up over his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	Indeed, many children indeed imitate this dissection in schools: it is an easy matter for him who wishes it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the child's penis, one end that is going over the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then and apply a tight bandage of flesh with the knots that are in the child's penis.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already with the knots of the child's penis.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread: and place it in the nose after washing the nostrils with the Egyptian ointment that you have drunk: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment dissolves all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place the end of the thing in the nose a lead tube, for some days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however, he needs care that dries out, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make the head purge, with which olives and other medicines are distilled in the nose, make it of silver or air: which is similar to a small lamp, open like a concha: and its mouth similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed tube, like a cane.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the concha instrument for making the head purge should be full, detected: which has a handle in its end, with which you hold it, when you heat in it oil, or what you want from burning wood, and things that flow.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	¶ About the care of Thelul's nose.
Caput XXV.	Caput XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Indeed, a head is born at the end of Thelul's nose, and it grows and increases with the days until a good appearance is made of it.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	It is therefore necessary, for that reason, to appear at the beginning of its appearance and remove everything of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over the place, or cauterant which is burning the medicine that is in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If then the incision of it is slow to grow until it becomes large, then consider it, if it is made of stone, hard, reddish-brown color, few senses: then you do not touch it with iron: because it is a cancerous ulcer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Indeed you often see that the monstrous ulcer of the hand is caused by it, and it happens from this malice that has been on it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the ulcer is a mild touch, not reddish-brown color, and you see that the incision is possible in the whole of it, then you escape with the weak, and cut it without fear, without trembling: and take care of the place where it extinguishes and constricts, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Regarding the suture of the nose, and lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Head 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You know that when the solution of the continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, it does not profit much in it operation, unless in some men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore when something happens to someone from it, you should consider if it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then gather the pain of the wounds with the suture: and then take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the solution of the continuity of the lips has already been separated, and every part has been made healthy: then it is necessary to remove all parts from its own appearance, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather the two lips with the suture, and tie it, and make a pustule over the blood of the dragon, and powdered olibanum: and put above the pustules a fragment of plaster diafinicon, and some other plaster consolidated: and release it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it, and mix the medicine again: and let it alone until the threads come out by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointment, until it is cured.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	However, the method of the suture is to gather the continuous solution, or with a candle, as we have mentioned in the suture of the lungs: or gather the solution with thread, as I will show you to know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	¶ On the extraction of false teeth.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Indeed, many people have hard and painful spots in the interior of their teeth, caused by small and large plants. And some of them are smaller and larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to open the lip, and pull a thread all around the tooth, and hang it with a needle, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after cutting the thread, until blood comes out.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then wash with vinegar, and heal the place where there is stitching, until the wounds are cured.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	¶ On the cutting of the flesh of the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	The flesh of the gum is often born, which the ancients call abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, it is necessary to hang it with a needle, or hold it with pliers, and cut it at the root of it, and let the healthy blood run, or the blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on top of the place where the thread is cut, or other small stitches, and make them dry.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	That if the flesh returns to it after the treatment, for it often returns, then cut it again and cauterize it: for it does not return after the cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Regarding the Reason of Teeth with Iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When the parts of the teeth are aggregated from within and without, and between the gums are sharp, rough, and sometimes become blackened, and then become smooth and yellowish, until the corruption reaches the gum, and then they become unsightly.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore you should make the patient sit with their hand on your shoulder, and place their head in your lap, and rub their mouth and tooth, in which the bark appears, and something similar to sand, until nothing remains of it, and also do the same for blackness, whiteness, yellowness, and other similar qualities, until they become clean.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If something is removed from them that was at the beginning of the reason, it is good: and if not, then you should repeat the reason on them on the next day, secondly, and thirdly, until finally your desire comes to an end in what you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you know that the tooth requires different shapes and many figures of razors, according to which it is prepared for your operation: the one is the razor that cuts the tooth from the lower part, the other is the razor that cuts between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these shapes of razors should be ready at hand which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Regarding the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary to cure the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and then to remove it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not that the tooth supplies itself with a bone when it is removed: for it is a substance that is elevated: until when there is no excuse for the removal of it, then it is necessary when you think to remove it firmly, and to be certain that the painful tooth is removed.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	The infirmity deceives the feeble pain, and thinks that it is in the tooth of the Saha and eliminates it: then the pain does not depart until the weak tooth is eliminated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When the tooth itself is certified as painful to you, then it is necessary to scarify around the tooth with sandarac wood, in which there is some virtue, until the gum loosens from all parts: then move it with your fingers, or with the tips of the thumbs at first gently, until you agitate it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large screws well in that place, and the weak head between your knees: which you have held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to its straightness, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not go out, then take one of their instruments, and introduce it under it from all parts with ease, and stir its movement, as you have done at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary to fill that hole with a piece of cloth: and tie it with the tip of the fine ends of the threads, so that it does not break in your constriction above it with the thumbscrews.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary to be very careful when scarifying around the gum from all parts, much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength, so as not to break it, and there remains a part of it, and the malice that is greater pain for it at first remains above it.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And be careful not to do this that unknowing bloodletters do in their haste and the boldness of their removal, beyond what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many times they cause great harm to the bodies of men, whose difficulties are such that they break, and all the roots of them remain, or some of them: or such as extract it with some of the bones of the jaw: as we have testified many times to this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it is covered after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If blood flows from certain places (for it often happens), then grind some of the zegi and fill that place: and if not, burn it with your zegi.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of the sharp points by which the tooth moves are first long-tailed, short necks, thick, so as not to double when they press upon the tooth: they should be like the thick necks of a hammer, until when you pull them with them, they do not bite into themselves, nor double: short-tailed, and they should be made of iron or of those that are not fit for the ends, and in their ends there should be teeth, some of which go into some, and are held by a proper contraction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes they become like the end of the jaw of a bird called the crow, and are strong in contraction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	§ On the Removal of Teeth and the Extraction of Bones from the Jaw.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains at the removal of the tooth which has broken off, it is necessary to put on the place a poultice with honey once or twice a day until the place becomes soft: then insert into it a needle or a forceps, whose ends are like the end of the jaw of a bird called the crow.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of this is a forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	The ends of these are made like a spoiled thumb: or like an aliskife.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If then you do not submit to the end with these claws, it is necessary to make a cut above the root, and pull out the entire flesh, and insert the small instrument called the Palanca, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	The end should be short, but rather large: and it should not be drunk, lest it be broken.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If however the root goes through this, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to apply with these other instruments whose forms are like these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first end is a triangle, in which there is some bulkiness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the second end is a triangle, subtle.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It may also be applied with this instrument having two branches, whose form is like this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which preceeded in the ratio of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It may also be applied with this instrument that is similar to a large uncino, whose form is a triangle, twisted, in which there is some bulkiness, so as not to be broken: and it should not be drunk.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you know that the dental instruments are many: and similarly other instruments are not counted, and a wise craftsman has found by himself the instrument, according to which it operates and cures itself.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For from the diseases are made those to which the ancients did not speak about the instrument, because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If however the bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the face, or putrefies: then examine above it in the place where it was with that which is convenient to it from the instruments and claws which I said in the extraction of the root, and apply with your hand, whose form is like this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Sit in the beginning with a slight increase in size, so that it can be stretched or held together with that bone, and does not fear or wear out, until it exits the bone: and restore the place with suitable medicines for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	However, if there is a small pus in the bone, then rub it out of its own pus, and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Regarding the suturing of prominent teeth over others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth do not grow according to their natural course, a monstrous form is produced: and this is especially true when it happens in women and girls, that is, those who are of marriageable age.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you should consider this.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if the tooth is born after another tooth, and is not placed, or its suture is possible, nor its own lipping: then remove it: and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it off with this instrument, which has this form.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small face, and it is made from iron with sharp points at both ends.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And your cutting should be the one you make in many days, and for the hardness of the teeth, and so that it does not move another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	However, if it is prominent exposed to its own lipping: then lip it with the same lip that has this form.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It should be all of iron, and the head of its small points should be as small as the lip that makes the needles: with which it is lipped over the tooth gradually in many days with ease, so that it does not move the tooth, and falls off: then gently remove it, at the end, rub it with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is a tooth from which a part breaks off and hurts the tongue: then it should be lipped also, until the roughness of that break is removed and made equal: and it will flatten and not hurt the tongue, nor corrupt the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	In the description of the teeth with golden sons.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When there is a concussion and agitation of the anterior teeth, either by blows or chance: and an weak person cannot hold them together over the part that is chewed so as not to fall: and they are cared for with stimulating medicines, and the treatment is not avoided: then the wisdom is to tie them with gold wire, because silver becomes dull and rots in days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And the thread should be of medium fineness and coarseness according to the amount that is taken between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the shape of the tie is that you take the thread, and insert it twice as long between two healthy teeth: then you should twist with both ends of the wire between the moving teeth, whether one or more, until the swelling with cloth up to the other sound part.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then you should repeat the twisting up to the part from where you began: and hold your hand with fineness and wisdom, until it does not come loose at all, and the tie that you make by pulling up the thread between the roots of the teeth should not fall off.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the loose ends of the thread with a knife: and gather them together and turn them with your hand, and hide them between the sound tooth and the moving tooth so that they do not hurt the tongue, and then let it be tied as tight as possible while it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it is loosened or falls off, tie them with another thread and let it stand firm for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the shape of the teeth, and the figure of the tie of two sound teeth and two moving teeth as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth remains, or two after the accident of the knife and the hammer in their places, and are tied as we have said, and remain: and this is done only by a skilled artisan, wise, and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	When it comes to setting a bone from the ribs: and it is made like the shape of a tooth, and placed in its place, where the tooth is fastened, as I have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	¶ Regarding the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Head 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When the ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, as it is from the time of human birth, or accidental, from the elbow that has already solidified.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is to open the weak mouth of its head in your groove, and split its tongue: then incise this nervous ligament through its breadth, until it is loosened from its own retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is any hard knot or node, and it is from the consolidation of the wound: then extract this knot, and find it through its breadth, until you incise the ligament, and the node is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful not to make a fissure in deep flesh, and incise the artery there, and blood may flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then apply to the wound of the incision with hot water, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a bandage of linen, that holds firmly all night, so it does not consolidate secondarily.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if blood flows, then place above the spot a piece of flax.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If not, then cauterize the place with a sharp iron that is suitable for it, and then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	The extraction of Ranula which is made under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When an apostema occurs under the tongue which resembles a small ranula, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function: and perhaps it becomes so swollen that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is to open the weak mouth before the sun: and consider the apostema.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If then you see it to be of a red or black color, hard, which does not give way to the weak sense: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined to a whitish color, which is moist: then insert the thumb into it, and cut it with a soft salt, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood does not come out of your mouth during the operation, then place a piece of chewed bread on it until the blood is absorbed: then return to your operation, until you take it out with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then rinse it with vinegar and salt: and care for it with the rest of the treatment suitable for this, until it is cured.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	The cure of two breasts.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When two breasts occur between the throat, that is, glands which resemble linen, which occur in deformity: and they are called two breasts: when you cure them along with what I said earlier in division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If then it is a hard apostema of a red or black color, with few senses: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is a red color, and the root of it is large: then do not touch it with iron, fearing the flow of blood, even though you let it go, until it is mature.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	Then you will either pierce it yourself: or it will burst on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	If it is white in color, round in shape, and its root is fine: then you must cut it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	If the operation is to be performed on the same spot where the hot pimple has quietly completed its course, or if it is about to diminish: then let the weak one lie down in the sun, and place the head of the patient in your lap: open the mouth of the patient, and take hold of it with your own hands, and press down the tongue of the patient with the instrument which has this form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver or air, which is as fine as a dagger.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you press the tongue with it, and show the pimple to you, and it falls on top of your used one: then take a thread, and tie it in the hollow, and pull it out from outside as much as you can, without taking anything from the cloth with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with the instrument which has the form that follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It will resemble a sickle: but the ends of them are blunt, so that the opening of each of them is in the direct acute angle of another: therefore take care that it is made of iron, or that it is dipped in blood.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut it with the one which has the following form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It should be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut the first one, cut the second one in the same way as the first one.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the cutting, gargle the weak one with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If blood flows from it, gargle with water in which the bullae of the bark are cut, or the leaves of myrtle and such like from stitches, until the blood flow stops: then take care of it until it is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	When certain stones are born in the throat, there are two besides the two breasts.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, these should be cut equally according to what I said about the incision of two breasts.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	Indeed, I have already treated a woman with a stone that had been born between the two breasts, which she had drawn to the neck, and it was nearly closed: the woman was breathing from the narrow opening, and she had forbidden it food and drink, and she had perished if she had remained alive for one day or for two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	The stone rose so much that it emitted two branches before they passed through the two openings of the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore hastily fixed the other one in a knot.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	I then drew it out, and a large portion came out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	I then cut it off where I could comprehend it from the opening of the nose.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	I then made this to her that came out of the other opening of the nose.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	I then opened her mouth and pressed her tongue: I then fixed the knot in it: I then cut out a large portion from it, and it did not come out but only a little blood: The woman's throat was therefore released, and she began to drink water immediately, and then she took from food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not therefore stop cutting it for a long time from that stone: and the stone was in the place I was cutting, until it was too long and with this.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore used my ingenuity and cauterized the stone between the two breasts.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It remained still, and then I walked on from that side, and I do not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Section on making an ulcer incision with a knife.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When catarrh descends to the ulcer and makes it longer, then it is called a perpendicular ulcer. And if it is in the lower part, which is thick, round, then it is also called a vesicle.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When the division is made as we have said, and there is no cure of it, and you see that the hot knife has left it and it is fine, then it is necessary to cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And if there is anything gathered on it that is round and does not have length, and it is bloody or of a red or black color and has no sense, then it is necessary to make an incision on it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear in the weakest part.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner which I have said of white and its length, then make the weak part sit by the sun: and press the tongue of it with the instrument which follows the narration, and then tie a string in it and draw it downwards: and cut it with one of two instruments which I have said in the incision of two clavicles.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary to cut from it unless that which is added above natural end is without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more than necessary, you will harm the lip and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the cutting use that which we have said in the incision of two clavicles: and take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the weak one is afraid of the cutting, then it is necessary to use your skill in cauterization of it without fear and gentleness.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the mode of cauterization in it is not, except with sharp water: and it is, as you place the weak head in the socket of your vein.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press the language of its with the instrument that we say.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water that I told you in the chapter of cauterization, and wrap it with a non-extinguished iron scalpel, neither thick nor thin, and fill this connection with this instrument's form, which is this one.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	The connection of its extreme where the medicine is placed should be like the connection of the cochlea's radii.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the same layer: and let it be weak lying on its side, so that saliva from its mouth is drawn out internally by the medicine, so that nothing of it descends to its throat and harms it.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first of it on the same quantity of the middle hour, until you see it already faded and sated by the medicine's bitterness.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a pill and place it on the extreme of the radii, and inject the pill with the medicine, and insert the radium with the pill into the cannula below, until the pill adheres above the layer.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times until you find out what you want from cauterization of the skin.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it go: for it itself will wane and fall after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	What if you need to take the medicine again? Then take it again: and after cauterization, wipe around the skin with the pill taken in honey, and cleanse yourself with what is around it from the medicine: and wet with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it is cured externally with an ointment, and swallowed with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore this species of curing is more salubrious than a long incision and less frightening.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	When the wound is cured, even if it is softer than cauterization and incision, it is cured with suffocation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Combine calamite, hyssop, origanum, rue, sage, chamomile, and burdock, and all similar herbs. Mix them together, or some of them in a pot, and let them soak in vinegar, and boil: and the pot should be washed with cleanliness, and the hole in the middle of the pot should be for the instrument of the concaium according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make of silver or air: and insert the extremity, in which is the ginger, into the weak tooth, until the vapor rises to the wound through the tube, until the wound becomes very much obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over the same spot, until it is scorched.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful not to perform this curing at the beginning with aseptics.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For plasters are added to aseptics, and it is not proper to do this except at the decline of the aseptics, which are hot.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If this instrument is not present to you, then take vinegar and put the end of the bark in it: so that the weak tooth will not burn: for the bark of the bark prevents the vapor from burning the tooth: and this is good for cure with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	¶ About the extraction of thorns and bones from the mouth.
Caput XXXVIII.	Head 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	The tooth adheres very much to the gum, or a thorn of a fish, or another.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, it is necessary to remove what is apparent above that falls on the sun, and declare to you what is in the mouth, after you have placed your tongue with the instrument.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	When it does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary for you to make a human weakness before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the matter attached by vomiting will be released.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the weak one may swallow the sharp end of a nut, or the root of a lettuce, or the tip of a dry bread; or he may take the tip of a dry marine sponge and then swallow it. And tie it up in a thread and then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When he comes to the place where the spine or the bone is, and it is extracted, then he goes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If he does not go out with that which we said: then use the instrument from the second leg according to this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	It should be larger than the radius but smaller than a thumb, and at the end of it there should be a notch that he inserts into his throat with ease, and he himself should have his head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him be careful of the touch of his epiglottis so that he does not get a fit of coughing, and pushes with it either the bone or the hand of the physician.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	Indeed, when the weak one inserts it, this is better: because of his knowledge of the place where the thing attached is: and he pushes down or pulls up his hand with the instrument upwards, all of it according to the quantity that is prepared for him until it goes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	¶ About the extraction of Sanguisuga.
Caput XXXIX.	¶ Head 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the sanguisuga is treated with that which I said in the division of care with medicines and does not fit, then consider in the weak throat in front of the sun, whether at the sun after he has put his tongue with the instrument that I will tell you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If then your custom falls upon blood-letting, take it out with a small ivory needle, or with a gentle grasp.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If then it is not possible with these: then take a hollow needle, and insert it into the weak throat near the throat: then insert into the hollow of the heated needle with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this often: and let the weak one abstain from water all day long.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take cold water full in his belly, and open his mouth into it: and let him wet his mouth with it, and swallow nothing out of it: and let him drink water an hour after another with his own hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For blood-letting falls down with the sense of blood.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If then he does not follow what we have told him, then suffume the weak one with incense, or with a gentle grasp with the instrument that I have described for suffocation.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this often, for it falls down.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in suffocation is to take a pot wherein are young pearls with fire: and the pot be covered with a covering, in the middle of which is a hole: and the end of the instrument is put into this hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then draw off the suffocation, and let him open his mouth at the end of the hollow, and close his mouth, so that he does not suffocate until you know that the suffocation has made blood fall.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For blood-letting falls down immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If then it does not fall, then do suffocation often.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the weak one will endure thirst, and eat salt, and honey, and will not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that he go out with this diet.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	This is the shape of the instrument used to extract blood from the stomach, when it falls on itself.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It resembles a pair of forceps, as you see: unless it is this curvature that is inserted into the stomach.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And the end of it is similar to that of a goose's beak, where there is roughness of the fingers: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	¶ About the opening of the Apostemate, and its sectioning, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Head 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of Apostemata, of different sizes, according to the rememoration of them, that is, one and one in this book: and they are different in their piercing and sectioning from two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of them is of the kind of Apostemata in itself, and that which grasps from moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is because of the places where it happens to the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For the Apostemata happening in the head is different from that happening in the anus: and the Apostemata happening in a fleshy place is different from that happening in joints: and each of them has its own judgment from their operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from the Apostemata there are those which it is not fitting that they should be pierced unless after the maturation of the sore in them, and the complement of it: and there are those which it is fitting that they should be pierced while they are raw, and do not mature according to the complement.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	So Apostemata which are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when the Apostemata happen near the joint, and it extends itself, until it putrefies which is in its circumference, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore it is a cause nearer to the contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	If it is an abscess on the main limb, then it is harmful to either you or the member from which it bursts, or through that member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	If it is near a joint, then the wound is not yet fully healed, and it should not be opened if it is near a joint, otherwise it will decay deeply and extend to the inner parts of the joint, or a fistula will form, or it will not heal at its end.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary to know the hour of the abscess's opening, according to the complement: it is near the sedation of pain, the recession of fever, and the decrease of rubefaction, and the pulsation of the head abscess: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	It is necessary to make the same opening on the lower part of the abscess, and more deeply: and the wound should be made in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the fingers, and the tendons, and the nerves, and the arteries, and at last in all equal places where there is no reflex:
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those where there is a reflex, close the wound with the member on which the opening was made.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When the abscess is in fleshy parts, it is better to leave the wound open until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you open it before that, the course of the wound will be prolonged, and there will be many sore and sore places, and perhaps the lips of it will become hard, and its depth will be increased.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are opened according to the length of the body, at the necessity: or according to the member that is needed.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	It is necessary to make incisions in the small labia and in the large ones, making them wide; or to make many sections in the likeness of the size of the labia.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	These are from the labia where it is necessary to cut through the skin; and the incision is made when the skin is already like a cloth, and is made at the end where the dead part is, as in the case of many, such as in mumps, and tumors.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And from these there are those that are cut with a three-angled section.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from these there is one, by which the incision is made like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	So the labia.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from these there are those where a round section and a lunar section are made, and similar ones from the sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	However, if there is no head like the smooth and superficial labia, it is necessary to make the incision through the superficial or flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary when the labia is large and has already collected a lot of healthy tissue, and makes an incision in it, so that not too much pus is drawn out at once: indeed, it should be taken from that part itself.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then fill the labia up to another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then take some more pus from it.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this frequently according to the degree until it comes out: especially if the person is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a boy who is young, or an old man who is decrepit: for the animal spirit of the animal is resolved from animal to animal when the pus comes out: and perhaps the weak one will die, and you will not know.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore this chapter requires great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	After making the incision, you should clean the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If the wound is small and flat, then apply a linen bandage, or an old clout.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	If the wound is large and there are many incisions, then you should insert linen into all the fissures until they become moist with blood.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	If you have split a part of the skin, or cauterized it around: then you should cover it with an old bandage, or as when the cloth is tied, or the hair of linen is wet without moisture: and tie it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and care for it with ointment until it is cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however, blood flows in your operation hour, then apply cold water and vinegar, after which the bandage soaks it up: and place it over the flowing blood site many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If however, the blood flow persists, then you should give a treatment, and care, and pills which I will tell you in many places of this our book, and by division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If however, it is in the winter season, and the wound site is of many nerves: then you should pour pills with wine, and hot oil: and place them over the sites.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	If however, it is in the summer season, and the wound sites are fat: then you should place pills soaked in water and oil, or wine and oil, and all of it cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	When the third day comes, as I said, then you should dissolve the wound, and clean it, and give in its care what is suitable for it, until it is cured.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is what is necessary for the universal understanding of the apostem's care.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the semiotics, I have already said about all apostemates, how it is useful for their care in detail.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	¶ About the section of the apostemates that occur on the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Scalp XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small apostemates occur on the scalp and are of the species Nodorum, which are found in the clothes that are made from them, which are like the feathers of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their species is very many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Among them are fat ones: and among them are those that contain like moisture of the limbs: and among them are those that contain like moisture of flax and plaster: and such as these, and among them are those that are hard like stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in all sections, and there is no fear of their extraction, while it does not cause any contraction of the artery in their section.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their section is as I have experienced it with the instrument whose form comes after this, which is called the Intromissive, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains moisture, then dry it in the section according to the length of the surface section: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section from line b to line g. And when the moisture is expelled, then scrape out the kistin which contains this moisture, and do not let anything be left inside it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns, if there remains something inside it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then submerge the gutta in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the vulva with it, and let it remain until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	It itself will be discontented that a part remains from the box.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then follow up on the same belly with Egyptian ointment twice, and thirdly, and if you need it, until you trust that nothing will remain from the box, then care for the other side with ointment, until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the carbuncle contains a red node: then cut it according to this form, which has the shape of a cross: and strip the wool between the two sections, and scrape it off from all parts: and trust in your courage in extracting the wool that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If the artery causes you any contrariness: then do what I will tell you later.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly, in the carbuncle, if it is of stone: then cut it according to the section and treatment that I said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section on the stone carbuncle is easier: because it has fewer blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these carbuncles on the head of certain men, in which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I followed the carbuncle on the head of a woman's forehead, and found a carbuncle like a hard and solid stone, sharp, white, which could not be broken: and if it is scraped off with something, it wounds itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In others, however, there are accidents on the head of the carbuncle, except for these carbuncles that happen in the heads of children, and among the gold roots, the section of all of them is a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or, first, make a perforation from the lower part of them, so that the course of the pus may go to the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for it as for that, according to what suits them from the care.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	§ Section on the Strophular muscle in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These wounds often occur in the neck, under the jaw, and in the groin, and sometimes in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And those that occur above them in the neck are fewer and more severe, and are caused by the violence of the wound. And all the Strophlus is within its own shirt, just as it is in the noses and wounds of the heads, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	The appearance of these Strophlus is very varied.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For they are hard and some are moist, and some are malignant and do not obey the treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that which you see as having a good disposition in the wound, whose color is manifestly close to the skin color, and moves over all parts of the body, and is not anchored to the neck muscles, nor to the tendons, nor to the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary to cut this superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body along line b to line g, and extend the two lips of the skin with the razor, or with many razors, if you need that, as we said in the wounds of the head, and then take it out slowly.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is above the caution, so as not to touch the brain, or the nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel be not sharp and cold, so as not to add to your hand with the incision, or disturb the weak, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein, or an artery, or forbid you from the operation, then place in the thigh ground nuts, or some children who cut the blood, and tie the thigh, and let it go, until the sharpness of the wound is dulled, and the thigh becomes soft: or begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	The blood is let then, go to your operation, until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your finger tip the stitches of the Strophulus to others' wombs: then cut them and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If the root of the Strophula is very large: then it is necessary not to cut that Strophula from its root: indeed it is necessary to tie it with a strong thread and to let it go until it falls by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the old gut with the ointment of Egypt that you have already dipped.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole Strophula is cut, then it is necessary to gather the two lips of the wound and to stitch them immediately, after which you will see that there is no excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If however you see that there is excess due to the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary to consider cutting off its root and taking it out, and to apply the suture that I mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And whatever contains humidity from the Strophula, make a superficial perforation in it: so that you may see the place of its readiness for you: and place the perforation below the body, as I mentioned.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the hair after the perforation with ointment, and similar to it, so that what remains of corruption may rot until you see the wound already clean: then take care of it with the ointment of grown flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	¶ About the cutting of the Epiglottis from the aposteme inside the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients used to cut this section in the Epiglottis, and I have not found anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In cases where there is a tracheal tube (synanchiam), it is necessary to omit the section on the division of the epiglottis: because if a passage is made through that, all the veins and lungs are weakened.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In cases where there is a hot aphthae in the mouth, or throat, or both round lymph nodes, when there is no inflammation in the trachea, it is necessary to use the section on the division of the epiglottis to avoid destruction that occurs from praecociality.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to omit the division of the epiglottis, it is necessary to separate the epiglottis under three or four circumferences of the epiglottis, or five, by a small section through the width, in the part that is between the two circles by the quantity, which is the section in the sifac, not in the cartilage: and this is an appropriate place for the section, because it is bare flesh, and the blood is far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a sharp nail.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he will examine the skin until it becomes moist towards the trachea: he will let out blood if he sees anything in it.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he will seal the sifac that we have mentioned: and it means above the section of the trachea, when it exits from it, with what is broken, and by abscission of the tongue.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the groin be open at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the hour comes that you fear praecociality, gather together two lips of the skin, and take only the same without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer the medicines that cause flesh to be born, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis said.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this part of the discourse is that if the patient has already lost consciousness due to the apostematum, and the surgeon wants to operate on him after his death, he should cut the epiglottis to allow him to breathe from a different place, and thus save him from death. For this reason, they were instructed to leave the abdomen open for three days, until the malady of the patient has subsided, and it seems that the patient has recovered. Then, they were advised to close the wound and take care of it until he recovers.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw myself, that one woman received a sword, and sent it with her throat, and it occurred when she entered her lung.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to care for him, and I found him crying, just as the cry of the dead is.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Therefore, I removed it from the wound, and found blood that had escaped from the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore, I was surprised that it had not closed the wound, nor guided it: and the air was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Therefore, I acted promptly, and his own wound, and cared for it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the woman except that she had a cough in her throat: and she returned after a few days to a better arrangement of her own.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the cutting of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Regarding the sectioning of the guttiernal hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 43.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This apostemata, called the guttiernal hernia, is a large apostemata according to the color of the body: and it is much more common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	It is according to two modes: whether it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural, there is no genius.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental, however, is according to two modes: one of which is similar to a small feather.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode, it is similar to a spindle which is made from the nodation of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And it is fear itself, and it does not need to be assumed about it with iron, unless in the small one: and you prove it yourself, and investigate it with intromission.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If then I find it similar to a small feather, and it is not suspended with any wings: then dry it, as is done with the nods: and extract it with that which contains it from the kist, if it is in the kist: and if not, then examine the whole of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with which it must be treated until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Regarding the section on the species of nods.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many species of nods, and I have already said all the species of these in division: and it is necessary to point out this difference between the nod and the exit: since there is doubt about it.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say that when the exit is heat, and fever, and violent pains, until the ebullition of the superfluous one subsides, and putrefaction is completed: then the fever and the heat are quieted.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When the nod is not heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains them in kistis sifachin, which is their own bag, and is according to the color of the body: and it is a stopper like a chestnut, and it is like a brush, and greater and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	They are of two kinds: either they are fat: or they contain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you are wet in the treatment of Noma, you must try it first, and then look at the instrument called the Intromissive, according to its form in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of the probe is for all Noses, that you take this instrument and insert it into a moister place that you find in the probe: and then rotate your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has already pierced the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then the last hand of yours according to the size of the probe.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then take out the Intromissive and look at that which goes into the wound of it.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If then moisture runs out, whatever its color: then cut it off at the surface according to what I said in the others probes.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not run out in the wound of the Intromissive, then you know that it is fat: cut it off at the surface with a cross-shaped section, according to the form I showed you: and suspend it with strings, and scrape the skin from all sides with ease: and keep the kistin if you can over it, so that it takes out the sound Noma.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the kistin is broken at the operation and cannot be taken out, often this happens, then take it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little remains of it, or much, the Noma returns according to the most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And if it does not heal you, and there remains little of it: then fill the wound at the end of your cure with some sharp-pointed children's teeth, and tie it up, and put the hot probe over it, and care for it with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then the knot is large, then its two lips, and care with it that it may be incarnated.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If then the opposite evil is a small one, or not small: then immediately, and fill the wound with three layers of threads, and release the tight knot for two days, or three, until the wound has putrefied, and the ebullition of blood has ceased: then return to heal that which remains from the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	§ Regarding false instruments for cutting and drilling.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are three forms of introducers, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For among them there is a large one, and among them there is a medium one, and among them there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	May they be made from tempered steel quadrilaterals at both ends, so that the introduction may be made quickly into the aperture.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of the introducers, and not, that is, the drills: and one of them is called beris, that is, the piercer: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For among them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They come together, so that they may be investigated through those apertures, and exits, and fistulas, and bones from the one that is between them.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, thin, and soft, like the large needles from which the seats are made, of silver certainly, or of air, or of iron, or of gold.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And their better ones are those that are made of silver.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And they are also introducers of lead black, which come together so that they may be investigated through those fistulas, whose reflections are refractions, so that they may be reflected with the lenity of their reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	The three species are again.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For they are long, they are medium, and they are short, according to the size of the fistula and its stricture.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of the ninth, and they are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For they are simple, namely those with a single ulceration: and they are three kinds as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are the ninth blind: and they are three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are the ninth with two ulcerations, and they are three kinds: and from them are the ninth with three ulcerations, and they are three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, by which the nails are cut and scratched, and the staples are removed: and they are three kinds: for there is a great, a medium, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities by which the incision is made are sharp, while other extremities are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except when with them there is an excitement of the nails in the scratching of the nails at the fear of the incision of the vein, or of the nerve: and so it heals through these weak ones, and finds tranquility rather than what it finds at the scratching of the staples.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the Madras, and they are three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of iron, and they are similar to the Rhodes, with which alcohol is made: and at the end of the flat point there is a hidden dot of Spatumilis: and it runs towards the interior and exterior when you wish, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of Spatumilis which is hidden between the fingers at the staple incision: and they are not perceived by the weak: and they are three kinds, great, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The three kinds of winds that divide the flow of blood are: the great, the medium, and the small ones.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of air or citrino, round, and nearly as long as you see, and they should be of a subtle nature.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of winds be at your disposal, both the great and the small ones: so that you can cut through the blood with ease when there is a necessity, and then when no doctor is present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you will not use them in cutting through all parts of the body, and you will only use them in the locations of the flesh: such as the knees, and hips, and the shoulders, and breasts, and mammary glands, and throats, and groins, and similar parts, from the fleshy parts, which are humid.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they become small instruments of the same kind as those made from fistules, according to their form: which cut through the blood when it flows from the site of phlebotomy, or at the wound, or at the artery: and sometimes they become round in this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Regarding the treatment of human breasts that are similar to those of women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Head 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell up when they are near the end of sleep (that is, when they start to be polluted in their sleep) until they are like the breasts of women: and they remain full of poison.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, if he detests this, it is necessary to cut over the breasts with a lunar section, according to this form from the line b to the line g. Then scrape off all the grease.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards, fill the wound with medicated gristle.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then, gather the two lips of the wound with the suture, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If the nipple leans towards the lower parts and softens due to its size, as often happens in women: then it should be cut into two equal parts on the upper sides, with each part containing the other at their ends, until the larger line contains the smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Then, scrape off the skin that is between the two lips and remove the fat, and apply what I have mentioned about the suture and gums, which is necessary for the cure, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If the incision does not lie down as it should, due to weakness or because of the flow of blood: then it should be filled with gristle under a dressing of corrosive ointment, and let it remain until the remaining part becomes corroded from the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then, care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	¶ Regarding the puncture of the staple that happens under the Titillation.
Caput XLVIII.	Head 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These staples that happen under the Titillation are made from hard species of Strophular, which contain kernels, and some of them have wetness in them.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Therefore, those that have wetness in them should be cut into a lunar shape, according to this form, from line b to line g, when the entire thing that is in the staple comes out of the sore, then fill it with old dressing, and let it remain until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then, remove the dressing, and care for it with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If an apoplexy has occurred in the form of a node of the Strophular group, then cut along it, as we have said in the section on the Strophular group, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If the finger is extended in this way and allows pus to be discharged, then apply a caustic in that place, according to what we have said in that place which was first mentioned.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	¶ About the section of an apoplexy that occurs due to the artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is torn and the skin above it consolidates, there often occurs from that point an apoplexy, and likewise the vein, so that there occurs in it an apoplexy and inflammation.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that an apoplexy and inflammation are due to the artery and vein are: for when an apoplexy is due to the artery, it is long, gathered in the deep part of the body: and when you press the apoplexy of your fingers, you seem to hear as if there were a cracking.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to the vein is round in the apparent body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section above this apoplexy is an error, and especially that which is under the scales, and in the groins, and at the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is a great wonder.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it is necessary that this care be neglected with iron, and that it also occurs at the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary that it be neglected.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore over that which is from them due to the inflammation of the artery's opening, find in the cut a longitudinal section.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with the hooks, then the artery: and free it from the coverings, until it is seen.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert the scalpel under it, and make it penetrate until it reaches another side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then press the spot where the two ligaments meet with sodium, until blood that is entirely in it comes out, and the apostematic membrane is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply the curing agent that generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is apostemata due to the section of the vein, then it is necessary for you to hold your hand with which you can hold the apostemata with your skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the scalpel under the place where you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and there should be a double thread in it until the other side has taken it out.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the apostemata with the same good bandage: according to what I told you in the good vein bandage, with two parts from two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you think that the thread may be taken out, then insert the scalpel another with another thread under the apostemata completely at the incision of the scalpel: press and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the apostemata in the middle of it, until when it comes out what is in it: then make an incision for the excess skin and let that which is tied be released from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put a little ointment on the one you dipped in wine.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the curing agent that is made with laudanum and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	¶ About the apostemata that happen from the twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	Head of the Lamb
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As it happens with the artery and vein, so it happens with the nerves: that it happens by striking them, or by excessive labor, and similarly: and it happens most in the places of helpers, or the heel, and in every place where the joints are stretched, and it is a serious matter.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It resembles the color of the other parts of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is drawn with strength, it feels in it a weakness similar to that of amazement.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And there is no gathering of amazement in the deep parts of the body, indeed it is on the cheek, and it moves to all parts, and it does not go to the anterior part, neither before, nor after to the posterior part.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	What therefore comes from them in the joints, it does not need to be with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps it will happen to contract.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that however which comes from them in the head or in the face, find the skin with sand.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If then it is a small amazement, hold it with thorns and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is great, then suspend it with a razor and exfoliate it, then remove it, and gather the wound with a suture, and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	¶ About the section of the amazement that happens in the belly.
Caput LI.	Head of the Lamb.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Occasionally happen to some men multiplied in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, the warts, which are called Fungali, by similarity with their mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is fine, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned over.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	It is one of them that is small and one that is magnified in appearance.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	Indeed, I have seen a man, and within his belly there were two thymele, which were greater than the others: there was no difference between them, white and small roots, and his lips would change color, and they would become moist. This was always present.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore, I cut it and found in the weight of one almost XVIII and VIII ounces and in the other almost VI ounces. The operation in the incision of these is, as you see now, if the patient is weak, and the color of the thymele is white, moist, and subtle root: then cut it with a flat spatula, and let your cauteries be present in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For many times blood is expelled at the section of this: therefore, if you do not cut blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see a weak and timid man being cut with iron, then take a thread from the plumb, made in an appropriate manner, and string it with it: whose mode I have mentioned, and release it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the plumb's closure.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	You do not stop stringing the plumb, whenever it presses into the thymele, until it is released and falls without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	However, if the thymele root is large, then there is some fear and weakness in its cutting: especially in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless, it may be possible to cut it in half.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not remain.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And be careful not to presume to cut the thymele that is of a red color, few senses, ugly appearance: for it is an aposteme cancerous: and I am alive with a reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	The care of hernias.
Caput LII.	Chapter 21.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Hernias can occur due to many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from a tear in the abdominal wall, which is above the ventrum, and it exits through this ordeal, or the intestine, according to what happens in the others.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows out of the vein, or from the artery, according to what was mentioned earlier.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from the congestion of the ventricle in this place.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however, it is due to a tear in the abdominal wall, and the exit is through this orifice, then the color of the strangulation is similar to that of the body: it is soft, without pain, and appears to have different positions.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then the position of this part is as we have described, with a greater diversity of the stronger.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press on it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound at that time: and it is greatly admired among the entrance of the baths, and the labor of the weary.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If however, it is due to moisture, it is soft, and it does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor is it added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If however, it is due to blood, then with these signs, the strangulation appears as black from the limb.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however, it is due to flesh that has been born, then the strangulation is dark, heavy, hard, and appears according to the quantity of one.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If however, it is due to congestion, then the touch of this part is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in this case is such that you should consider this now, if the hernia of the navel is due to blood from the artery or vein, or congestion: then it is necessary to forbid its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	In that there is fear and weakness, as I taught you in the chapter where I said apostemata for the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the eminence of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or zirbum, then it should be precipitated on the weak one, so that it may hold its thirst, and stand standing extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with incense around the entire umbilicus.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to rise between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround it with a broad side of soap around the place where you marked with incense.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the apostemata mediately to the upper parts, with a large uncino.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie him around the strong part with thread, or with a firm cord of silk ligation: and let the node of the ligation be elongated.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the extended apostemata mediately above the ligation.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If then you find it already caught by the ligation: then extract the elongated one, and insert your thumb indicated, and push the intestine into the interior of the vein: and if you find the zirbum, then take it with a uncino and cut overabundance of it.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however the opposite is to you artery or vein: then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles and insert them in them two strong lines: and insert two needles around the apostemata in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then string the apostemata in four places over the needles: and if you will, remove the needles, and let the place be empty, until putrid flesh extended: and it will fall by itself: or cut it when subtle and putrid.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it yourself with him, as is necessary from the ointments, until he is cured.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the prominence of the umbilicus is from flesh in that part, or from moisture: then it is necessary to make an incision of the abscess, as I have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And blood or moisture, which I find in it, will be drawn out.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of it yourself with him, as to make the place solid.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	¶ Regarding the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Head 33.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	I have already said about the division of the species of cancer, and how it is necessary to take care of it with medicines: and it is necessary to be careful of it when taking care of it with iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and I have said that cancer generated in the womb, and precaution for its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as cancer which is in the breast or in the thigh, and similar parts, from the fixed members to take it out entirely: especially when it is beginning male.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When however it becomes old and large, it does not need to approach him.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not cure anyone from it: nor have I seen anyone before me who has been healed of this.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is placed as I have said, is like the preceding, and you dissolve the weakness from black vomit repeatedly.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then if you find a phlebotomy with clear fullness,
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	then prepare the weak preparation, in which it will be placed with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then take out the hairs that are around it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then make an incision of it from all sides according to the cut, until nothing remains of its roots: and let blood run, and do not cut it rashly, rather express the blood from the place, and wipe up the blood with your hand, or with whatever is available there with the instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, the flow of blood from a large incision in an artery is contrary to you, or inflamed: then cauterize the wound, until the blood is abscised.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it yourself with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	¶ Regarding the treatment of dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Head LVIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we have spoken of the division of the kinds of dropsy, and how aggregation of water occurs, and the signs of each kind, and the treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are treated with iron are not excepted but only the asphylactics alone: and they do not approach with iron to the phthiatic kind: nor does the asphylactick kind approacheth to the hydropic kind: for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When thou hast already treated this kind of dropsy with iron and it does not yield to thy medicine: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient be already weak from the dropsy, or if there be another infirmity besides this, such as a cough, or expectoration of phlegm, and such like: then fear lest thou give him iron, for he is afraid.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If however thou seeest an one of excessive strength, and there is no other disease besides this, save dropsy alone: and he be neither a child nor an old man: then the mode of operation in him is, that thou remove the weakness standing by thy hand, and make him minister to it after him, holding water in his hand, pressing it down towards the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spongium with spikes, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be of two parts, sharp on both sides, long, and sharp at the extremities, like sponge.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	Indeed, there is some subtlety regarding brevity in it, so do not rush through the operation until the intestine, and you may harm it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of Hydrometra is from the intestines, then it is necessary to extend it with the section at the umbilicus, three digits in length, downwards in a straight line above the navel.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed, the generation of Hydrometra is due to the lameness of the thigh: then your section should be on the left from the umbilicus, three digits in length.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of this is due to the spleen: then the section should be on the right side: and it is not necessary for the section to be on the right side beyond where you wish the weak part to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then make a hole with the instrument and cut through the entire skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert the section into it and spread your hand with Siptilum between the skin and the fingernail, and rub as if you are scraping off the nail itself: and the quantity to be scraped off should be about the same as the quantity of the nail.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then scrape and rub until Siptilum reaches the empty place: and that is the water place.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then take it out and insert the instrument into the hole with the form of this instrument.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or air, or aurichalco, linen, and tersum: which has a small hole in the bottom of its part, and three holes on its sides, two from one side and one from the other: and the edge of its end is cut according to the size of the fingernail, as you see: the end of its upper part is an armillary sphere.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument is wet with water, then it comes down immediately on the instrument, therefore it drains out of the water in half an hour's amount.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you drain out more than is proper, in an hour it may kill the weak one by the resolution of his animal spirit: or it may come to a syncope which approaches to death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Indeed, drain out of it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what signifies to you the weakness of its pulse, and of its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then take out the instrument, and keep the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it holds immediately by the skin which holds the hole that is above the sifac: of which I will tell you how to make it perforate according to that mode.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then try the instrument on the other day, if you see the weak one tolerate that: and also take out a small amount of water from it.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this on several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains not much out of the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If however you fear for the weak one, and let much out of the water: then take care of it with the earth in hot sand, and much sweat in the bath and sun, and expect on the time: and take care of it with the medicines which are exiccatiuis, until it is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, and the liver, and the spleen, after the extraction of the water: according to what I will tell you in that.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	¶ About the care of children who are born from places of their urine which are not perforated.
Caput LV.	Caput LV. (Chapter 50)
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any child goes out of the womb of its mother, and the head of the same is not perforated, or the hole is strict, or in a different place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary then to provide aid immediately after the opening of its own when it comes to the perforation of the Spatumili with a thin thread, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a fine wire inside the opening from the lead, and tie it up; hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When then you wish to urinate, remove it, and mix.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then bring it back again.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead wire, it is possible that the urine which comes over the place will not allow it to be closed.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	However, of whose opening it is strict, it is treated with lead wire, as I said, for many days until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	However, those in which the opening is not in its own place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	What is, because of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the female head: therefore it cannot mix to the anterior part, until she lifts herself by her own hand to the higher parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is it generation for her, because the seed cannot come to the womb according to its rightness: and it is a painful sickness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of the operation in that is, that it is overlaid weakly on its back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of that female with your left hand powerfully, and cut the head of the female head from its place, whether it is a nail or Spatumili sharp point, like the incision of a razor, or as you do with rods something similar to the head of a female, so that the middle of it comes like this: and let the opening fall in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of the blood flow at your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens to this.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore place it with it when it cuts the blood, and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	In the prepuce and on the head of the penis, and in cases of warts, blackening, and adhesions.
Caput LVI.	Head LVII.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These warts often occur on the genitals, and the flesh is particularly unsightly.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And some of them are malignant, while others are not.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, a non-malignant wart should be suspended with a fine thread, and cut off until it is completely cleaned.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place a submerged dough made from Egyptian ointment over the wart.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it afterwards with Egyptian ointment until it is cured.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the wart is malignant, with a bad color, then it should be treated with cauterization after cutting it and its root.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If the wart is inside the foreskin, not circumcised, and it is a part of the wart that is inside the foreskin, and a part of it is outside: then it should be removed, the innermost part first, until it is fully healed, then care for the outer part: because when you care for it at the same time, the prepuce does not secure itself.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And they also occur in the testicles, and in the prepuce, blackness and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should cut off everything that is already blackened and that wants to be corrupted, or it has already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then place a line over it afterwards with Egyptian ointment that has already been mixed with flour from the husk of the wheat and the hair of the goat.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If blood flow occurs, then administer cauterization with a lunar cauterization, in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	The cauterium is a boiling iron for two dispositions at once, namely for the flow of blood, and when the wound is corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the female head is corroded and destroyed in an hour, then it is necessary to insert a cannula from the knee into the soft tissue above it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the prepuce with the female head, and this adhesion does not happen unless in him whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required above it: and sometimes it happens due to the wound or aphthous ulcer: therefore it is necessary to remove it with a soft sandstone until the ligament is dissolved and the female head is free from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish this precisely, then it is necessary to remove something from the female head and the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is, because the prepuce when it is thin, may be pierced through its own thinness carelessly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the prepuce and the female head with a thin linen cloth that has already been made in cold water so that they do not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it is anointed with warm spirit until it is solidified.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	¶ On the cleansing of children and the treatment of errors that may occur in them.
Caput LVII.	Head LXXVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuous wounds like the others, but nevertheless, since it is our operation, our will, and its use is proper in boys, it is necessary to mark a better sign and a more beneficial one leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say that the ancients did not say circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired by experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	What is, because I find a greater part of artificers and phlebotomizers to use cleanliness, circumcising with a knife, and making incisions with needles: and they use them when they are prepared, and tie them with thread, and make incisions with the nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And indeed I have proved all these methods, and do not find a better cleanliness with needles, and tying with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in cleaning with a knife, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper layer of the skin is incised, and the inner layer of the foreskin: it is thought that an incision should be made to the other, and pain will follow.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when cleanliness is made by the prepared ones, that is, by the fingers, which surgeons use, it does not secure the incision of the male member: for perhaps it will enter into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleaning, however, when using the nail, perhaps iron is drawn out, and corrupts your operation: and indeed the skin of children is naturally small, and is often born in this way, so that they do not need cleaning: and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	Cleanliness with needles and tying with thread has given me good experience: for the foreskin is proportionate to the incision: therefore, because the sharpness above is like the sharpness below, it is cut.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you place your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate, and incise according to one operation at one time: and a similar compression is made, containing the skin of the woman from all sides, without any error whatsoever.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the mode of the operation is to make it appear as if you are cutting a boy especially, if he understands well that you do not cut him unless you tie the thread in his own flesh, and release it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him happy and joyful as much as possible, for he receives understanding from it.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands of the statue, and do not let him sit: and hide the sharp tools in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into the female's body, and blow into the skin, and pull her upwards until her head comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse her by that which is gathered in her dirtiness.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the place marked with two lines of thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie the lower part of that bandage as quickly as possible.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold it with your index finger, and mark the place of the lower bandage with good retention of your thumb, and cut between the two bands.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then tear up the skin from above, and pull out the head of the female.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better), and place a cloth under him: and over the cloth, the intestine of the boiled gall-bladder in which it was expanded, soaked with fresh rose oil, and placed on top of it until the next day: and take care of it further with the rest of the treatment, until he is cured.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the scalpel is for cleansing this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt, and let them be sharp: so that he does not come out of them at the end: and let the length of the two sharp points be equal to the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	Error in cleansing is: for perhaps the internal skin will escape entirely, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary to extend it from your hour with your nail before the incision of the place: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your own nail, then extract it with a file, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If more than three days pass, and there remains under the gauze something that has become inflamed, having been postponed: then release this, until the hot pinch is settled, and scrape it with ease, and cut it according to what you are prepared for: and take care of your head gauze.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For this will not hurt it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Take care of it when it consolidates the knee from the children's growths that we have mentioned in the book about children: and if it is cut from above the size, and spreads to the upper parts, it will not hurt it either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Take care of it when we have said that, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Of the extraction of the watery vernix from the skin.
Caput LVIII.	Head 88.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the skin is made from the exfoliation made of stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, and such as we have mentioned in the ways of treatment in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the watery vernix does not dissolve, and you see the retention of it to be because of the stone which is already in the skin of the uterus: then it will be necessary for it to be weak under its knees, being lame.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then they will be placed on the back of his foot, and the wetness of his will be extended from the upper part of his back, and he will tighten his weak fever as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, when the skin of the uterus is directed to the expulsion of the stone to the back: therefore, the watery vernix is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	That if it does not dissolve with that which we have said, and the fever is on the weakest part: then it will be necessary for you to administer the extraction of it with the instrument which we call siringa, which is of silver, and has this form: it is thin, and is lentil-shaped, as the cannula of a quill is in subtlety of its radicle, long in similitude of the palm of one and the other hand: and it is a subtle cannula at the head of him.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	The method of exiting the wine press by itself is as follows: take a double thread, and tie it at both ends with the wool or cloth, and make a good ligature: then insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the Siringae: if there is any excess of wool, cut it off with the forfices, then introduce it into the cannula with force, as in the case of Alzera.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the Siringae with oil or butter, and apply albugine: make the weak one sit down on a seat, and apply a warm poultice, and the woman with wet oils and olive oil, and hot water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the Siringae into the woman's body with ease, until it reaches the root of the woman's hair.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then make a double incision above the umbilicus.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the Siringae into itself until it reaches the bladder, and the weak one will feel that it has passed through the umbilicus: this is not done according to this order unless the meatus through which it passes has a kink.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The wine press follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out, and make the wine press run over the woman's urine: and do this again with the Siringae, and do not stop until the urine is discharged, and the weak one feels relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	¶ The quality of the female urine with Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the urine, or blood congeals in it, or pus forms in it, and you wish to distill water and medicines into it: then make with the instrument which is called Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is indeed hollow, that is, it is closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And within it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	The location of the piston, where that which impels it is placed, should be according to its quantity without addition, until when it draws something with it from the wetness; and when it is impelled, it expels it to a distance, just as the clepsydra does, which expels naphtha, that is, the Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you wish to expel the wetness from the wound, introduce the extremity of the clepsydra into the wetness, and draw with it that which impels to the upper part, for wetness is drawn into the hollow of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the extremity of it into the virga, according to what we have described in the uterus.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then impel the wetness with it, for that wetness is drawn to the wound immediately, so that it feels it to be weak.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of the clister is a fine one, by which the wound is clisted.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or gold alloy: whose head is similar to a small acama, and under which there is a sink into which the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the wound by the horns, and place wetness on it, with which you wish to clister the wound.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two sinks with a strong bandage doubled, and heat the wetness slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the clister into the virga, and then place your hand on the wound with a suitable tightness, until it feels weak, since that wetness has already been drawn to the wound.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If, however, there is no fresh gallbladder available, then take a fragment of parchment and make a circle from it and pierce it throughout its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert the thread firmly into those holes, as they rotate.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then aggregate the circle, as also does the alsofratu: after you have placed in it that which you wish to extract from wetness, oil, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it in the instrument: and make with it as you did with the gallbladder from expression with your hand, until wetness reaches the gallbladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On the extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Head LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	I have already spoken of the division of the species of a stone and its treatment with medicines, and I said the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and the gallbladder, and the signs of its entirety: and I said the stone which falls when cut and divided by hand, and that is the true gallbladder: and he who is represented in the womb: and I am telling you this with a clear and brief explanation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore that the stone generated in the gallbladder happens most frequently in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is apparent that urine escapes from the gallbladder like water of its kind in its subtlety: and there appears to be sand white in it, and the weak female grinds it with herself, and labors with it, and hangs heavily.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised and it departs with it the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is easy to cure children up to fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In juvenis however, it is medium, in that which is between: and the curative power of the stone which is greater, is easier: and if he is younger, he has been cured by that care.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the care of the sick, it is necessary in the first place, that we cleanse the weak with clysters, which draws out all the dung that is in his intestines: for this sometimes prevents the examination of stones at the inquisition.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the weak person take up his feet, and stir them about, and move towards the lower parts: that the stone may come down to the depth of the douche, or may salivate from its high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit with your hands prepared, and his hands be under the belly of himself, that a douche total may bend down to the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If then you find the stone in space, then immediately with a cut above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If then it does not fall entirely under your touch, then it is necessary that you wipe your finger with oil of the left hand if the child is weak: or with the middle finger if he is fully grown: and you insert it into his anus, and examine about the stone until it is under your thumb: and then turn him gradually to the belly of the douche.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and turn him away from the place towards which you wish to make the incision: and command the attendant to make the douche with his hand, and command another attendant to extend his right hand to the upper part: and the other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part of the place where the section is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the incising spatula, whose form is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it that is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, on the left side of the belly: and let the section be over it, and your finger be in the anus: and let the section be transferred, so that it be an external wide section, and an internal strict one, according to the quantity which is possible for the exit of the stone from it not greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed, the finger that covers the stone in the anus section, and exits without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that from the stone from which the angles and edges come, why it is difficult to exit it for that reason.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And it is soft, like a gland, and round, and it makes the exit of it easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, to which angles and edges are added in the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not exit in that way, then it is necessary for the engineers to be on top of it: or to string them on above it with a gesture that is decent for their extremities, which are like the moon, which strings over the stone and does not tear away from it: or to insert under it a subtle instrument with curved extremities.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot be above it, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something sticks to your blood, cut it off with a knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If the stone is more than one, then push the largest one towards the mouth of the uterus.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards, push the smaller one after that: and do the same if there are two of them.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If the larger one is hard, then ignorance is that it leaves above the section with a large cut.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the weaker of two things, or to die, or to happen to it a constant urine distillation: because the place is not entirely solid.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Indeed, manage the expulsion of it, until it exits: or the engines in the fracture with thumbs, until it is taken out piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the vulva with thure, and aloe, and blood of the dragon: and string it, and put above it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water: so that the hot apostema is set.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then, after a few days, you can reattach the muscle to its own neck, and do not loosen the ligament up to the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you will have released it, anoint the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then, care for it with ointment made from dafina and basilicum ointment until it is cured.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	However, if a hot pimple is added to the wound, and there is cracking, and such: just as when blood congeals in the urethra and is forbidden to pass urine: and it is known that this is from the exit of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore, insert your thumb into the wound, and remove the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, cause corruption of the urethra, and putrefaction of it.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then, clean the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and place every kind that is suitable for curing on it until it is cured.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the hours of curing for the whole, that you tie two thighs, and gather them, because of the medicines that are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	What if the stone is smaller, and is in the female urethra, and projects into it, and prevents the exit of urine: then care for it with what I tell you before the operation.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times you will excuse the section by this curing, because I have proved this.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take the Perforatorium from the iron of Alffericus, whose form is this: triangular at both ends, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and tie it with the female to the stone so that it does not return to the urethra.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert iron with a point into the wound with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and roll the perforator with your hand in that very stone slightly: and lean on the perforation of it, until you have made it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Indeed, urine is expelled immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on that which remains of the stone from the outside of the wound in the virga.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it itself will break, and it will exit with urine, and the weak one will be made strong.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	However, if this treatment is not prepared for you due to something that prevents it from being done on that one: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry the stone above the wound between the two threads.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterward, loosen the thread, and clean the frozen blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone unless it does not return to the wound: and another thread is tied above it, unless it returns to the skin when the thread is loosened after the stone is removed, and covers the wound: and for this reason you must tie that thread above when you tie the thread under, so that the skin is lifted up to cover the complement of your body, and cover the wound as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	¶ About the extraction of stones from women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	The stone does not usually occur in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	However, if a stone occurs in one of them, then the treatment is difficult and it is forbidden due to many modes.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	Their virginity is: for perhaps they are virgins.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And secondly, because you do not find a woman who is modest with herself when she is chaste, or from those who have children.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is because you have not found a woman well versed in this art, especially the operation with her hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	The fourth is the distance from the stone's place: therefore it requires a deep cut, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If the need arises for that, then it is necessary to take a woman physician, well versed in the art: and she is not found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you yourself perform it, then seek out a white, skilled, and present midwife, or a woman who has some knowledge of the art of women: then make her present, and above all to her, that she may do everything that you command her from the inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, that she is a virgin: then it is necessary to put her finger into her anus, and to search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she finds it, then grasp it with her finger, and then command the midwife to put her finger into the infirm part of the woman, and to search for the stone, after which she should place her left hand on the woman's belly, and compress it well.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If she finds the stone, then it is necessary to move it gradually from the orifice of the womb to the lower parts with all her strength, until it reaches the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should apply it on the opposite side of the infirm part of the womb at the root of the thigh, from whatever part it is prepared for it, and it will feel the stone in that part: and her finger will not be removed from the stone, she will grasp it with her finger: and the first incision should be small.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should put the saw above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If she feels the stone, then add to the incision according to the proportion that the stone is moving away from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	You know that there are many kinds of stone species.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	This is a smaller one, but larger, softer and harder, with branches and having a round shape.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore, you know the species of this one, as indicated to you by this above what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If you do not bleed, then add crushed ginger to the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is absorbed.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone has passed: and prepare for you with the instruments I said in the extraction of the stone, so that you can help with them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If you do not bleed, and you know that the blood is expelled from the incised artery: then place a piece of cloth on the place, and tie it with a knot that is fitting: and do not forget this: and let go of the stone, and do not take it outside.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the knee.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When the sharpness of the blood is calmed after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone has passed.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Regarding the sectioning of his aqueous hernia:
Caput LXII.	Head LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The watery hernia is not a rachis, unless the aggregation of moisture is in the white part of the glans, which is under the cover of the testicle: and it is called the glans.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in the bag that it prepared for itself by nature in the part of the vas, until it thinks that it is another manhood, and is a skin of the testicle between the white part that I said, and it does not happen unless rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this rachis is from the weakness that happens to the testicles, therefore this matter is poured down on them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	When it happens from percussion on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or is its color dilute to orange, or is it red like blood, or black and feces, white and watery, and that is the one that is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the water aggregation is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white part that we said, then the appendix is round in length almost like this figure: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in its own foreskin, then the appendix is round with the part oui, and therefore the man sees something else because it is something else.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white part, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When then you want to know the color of the moisture, then try the color of the moisture in the appendix when it is introduced into a square tube, whose form precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, by that which goes out in the track of the introduction, you judge what is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When then we come for the care with iron, then it is necessary to make a weak point first, so that if possible it bleeds that, and you see the body of his full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then it will rise on its back over its high but low back, and put under it many foreskins.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on his left side, and order the assistant to sit on his right hand, who extends his penis to one of two halves of the skin of the testicles, and to a part of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide plaster, and scrape the skin of the testicles from the middle by length, as near as possible to the belly: and make the cut according to the equality of the lines that divide the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white part comprehending: and examine it and observe, or cause it to leave this so that it leaves this: and let your excoriation be such as leaves this part which hangs down more: and scrutinize subtly according to the quantity that you can.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then, make a hole in the cork with wide piercing, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then, separate the two lips of the section, and extend the cork towards the top, and do not touch the skin encompassing the testicles: and incise the cork in whatever way is possible for you to incise it, or with its entirety, or fragmentarily, especially the thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not desire to scrutinize, there is no security in the incision, lest water remain.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	However, if water comes out from its own skin at the time of your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the cork, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then, gather the two lips of the skin of the testicles with the suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then, care for it as the other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	What if you find the corrupted water from another blackness: then it is necessary to tie the washcloths, which are suspenders, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then, remove the testicle with the suspenders, and draw out the water: then care for that as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two branches: then cut the other part according to what you have done equally in the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, that it be an operation alone: then do: and then clean the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And then insert the submerged thread in the oil or in the rose oil: and put another submerged thread of the linen which you have laid down in wine and oil, and expand it over two testicles, and observe the blood: and then place the doubled sheets on top, and they should be fine: and tie them on top with the ligament which is having six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Two cloths are then taken and tied together, and filled with the ointment, according to this similitude: and let the ends which it is placed on by the knife, or the wet wool, be gathered together with a twist in the armpits of the shoulders: and one end shall be taken up to the back, and the other to the part of the chest, and two ends shall be taken up to the two buttocks, and two ends to the two thighs, and the bandage is tied all over the armpits of the shoulders.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And, when artificially treated, this branch with the caustic at the site of the incision with iron: and it is, as you take the caustic with a small sword, and cut through the skin of the testicles: and it is burnt, according to what we have said: until when it is withdrawn with white grease containing water: then take the caustic, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letters are similar.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then the drill is made with it, and it is burnt until the moisture is completely removed.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the drill with gut, and scrape it with a fine caustic, and cut it as far as possible for you, until you have completely removed all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And take care not to touch it with fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you know that this operation is milder, and longer than the flow of blood, and better than the operation with the incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If it causes you inconvenience at the time of the incision, or in the cauterization aphthous sore, or the flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary for you to cure that which causes you inconvenience with the remedy that is convenient to it, according to what has been said.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If then the feeble one is timid and does not expect upon this operation because of the horror of his own: then administer perforation according to what I say that it is. And it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by you that which I say about the meanings, that the root is water-like: then it is necessary that you make the feeble one sit on the raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then make a perforation on the lower part of his thigh with the flap: and put the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until the whole water runs.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put over the place of the belly, and tie it, and let it go that the remaining water runs: then care for it until it heals the belly.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however the escape of water is contrary to the time of the perforation itself: and it is not so because the white cloth makes a contrariety in the orifice of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary that you insert your finger into the belly, or the instrument with which the water of hydropicum is drawn out, whose form precedes: or add to the operation of the wound briefly.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you know that the water returns, and is gathered after six months, or about those.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it is gathered, then it will be expelled according to the same manner, and the feeble one will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	¶ About the care of Ram's flesh.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that there is a fearful bringer of danger to many dispositions in the section above this Ram.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me its release from this healing.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am remembering the operation in it, and the species of the apertures.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say that many things happen to the body that are the cause of the formation of testicles, and this happens due to many causes, that is,
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from excessive sharpness or acidity which is poured onto the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from striking.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the wound is according to the color of the body, and it does not find pain in it: and it is a gray wound.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone wound, whose color is black, and there is no sense in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the nodulation of arteries, and their inflation: just as I have already remembered this: or from the inflation of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	And that which is from them due to the inflation of the arteries, is known by the position of the wound, when you comprise it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it does not need to touch it directly.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But that which happens from the inflation of the veins, is not dispersed from it at the compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible that a section may be made over this kind, and over the other flesh: and it is, that the skin of the testicles leaves.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the incision upwards, and pull it out with a white gauze, and free the suspensory from the wet cloth, and tie it: and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from all parts of the parts of it.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If then the wound is closed with these fleshy parts, then it is necessary to draw out the wound and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if the adhesion is between something of the gauze and something of the wet cloth, or in that which is between the gauze: then it is necessary to free all of that adhesion, and cut it with the round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If, on the other hand, the flesh nature is attached to a place of adhesion that is behind: then it must be incised all of it, and removed outwardly, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When your operation is completed, then anoint the wound with oiled lanolin and rose oil, and care for it with the rest of your treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	¶ Regarding the care of grapes, which is with vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Head LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Ulceration is a certain closure by a particular swelling, like a blister, with softening of the testicles: and it becomes difficult to walk, to move, and to go about.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this ailment is fear, because of that which precedes the remembrance.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	It is true that we should say the operation in it according to what they have done in the first place.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, therefore, that it is necessary that you make the weak one sit on the raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then press the suspensory of the testicles to the lower part.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the wet that is near to the woman: and hold it with another helper, and extend it with a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a wide, sharp slice of soap that has been transferred in the direction of the woman, until the wet is seen.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape from all parts, as we have said to you in the extraction of arteries that are in the joints.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then tie a thread in them where the thread is doubled, and tie it in the first places where the grapes happen: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them in the middle slice in a straight direction according to the length of the body, and take out what is collected from the moist and corrupt faeces.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the elbow with the treatment of the other wounds, in which you can grow healthy cells so that they fall off that nourish one testicle.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not evil for that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If however the grape vine affects all the wounds, then it is necessary to remove them because of the testicles with the wounds: so that they may not be clogged with nutrients due to the incision, and they may wast away or waste away, and there will be no inflammation with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	¶ Regarding the treatment of intestinal thorns.
Caput LXV.	Head LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The exit of this thorn is from the section that happens in the groove which affects the lower part of the abdomen from the external umbilical vein.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the groove or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds happen from various causes: either from percussion, or suddenly, or by noise, or by the removal of a heavy thing, and suchlike.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from the extension of the groove.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is a postero-descending abscess with a deep wound, therefore, because the groove compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from the section of the groove, because it makes a sharp pain happen suddenly from its beginning: and it is a postero-descending abscess with a deep wound, appearing under the skin near by: and this is on account of the exit of the intestine, and the course of it towards the external groove.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it escapes with the intestine, and this is called the intestinal thorn, and the zirb: and sometimes it happens with inflammation.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	When it runs into the intestinal feces and gets stuck there, and is present with the weak: for it causes pain to be made, and especially when it is laid down.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of the species of this disease, when iron is feared: therefore it is necessary to avoid the case in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the mode of the operation is to press on the weak, so that he may pull the intestine with his own hand to the inner part of its connexion, if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it will be raised up over his neck with your hands: and you will stretch out his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and dry the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then sew two lips of the section in the place where you need to open it: and the section should be according to the quantity that is possible, so as to come out of it a certain amount.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the phallus, and what is under the testicles until when it is stuck to the white phallus, hard from all parts: then insert your thumb into the one that follows the testicle, into the one that is between the white phallus, which is under the vulva, and between the white phallus, and detach it with your thumb along it towards the posterior part of it.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inner skin of the testicles: and when this stick the white phallus upwards with your left hand: and stretch the blood with the white to the section part: and tell the assistant to stretch it upwards: and you will detach the attachment, which is completely dissolved.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And seek your fingers to make sure that nothing is stuck in the white phallus that is hard and unsoluble in the intestine.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If I find anything from it: then drive it to the lower belly then.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take the acum, in which a thick thread is made from ten fibers, and insert it at the last sifah, that is, the layer of skin which follows the section of the testicles: then cut the extremities which project beyond the thread until they are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then compose some of them over others with a figure like the cross, and tie them together with an alsifach, as we said because it is a ligament under the skin of the testicles so that none of the waters which nourish them may be able to send something to them: so that no inflammation may result from there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place the second ligament again, according to the first ligament, farther away from it by at least two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And then let two ligaments go from the sifah which is under the skin of the testicles in proportion to the size of the finger: and cut the rest of it according to the roundness, and take out from it oum.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, where blood and pus run, as we said at the beginning.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply a wet lanolin under oil, and place on the thigh: and apply the ligament that we said.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white sifah which we said is cauterized, after cutting it, be careful of the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let the ligament go, until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If however it delays its case, then embrocate with warm water: and place on top of it what we said until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the rest of the wound-healing process until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Regarding the delicate branches.
Caput LXVI.	Head LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this branch, no one is seen who dared to use iron with the healing process.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that it happens as we have described in the branch that is with life.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, after the wound is sewn with thread below it, cut in the middle, and then care for the rest as it opens until they fall off, and care for the wound according to what we said until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Regarding the disruption that occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	Head LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the place is discovered, and nothing has come down to the testicles from the intestines: and if something does come down, it is little, and returns in every few hours: but if it prolongs that time, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the sifach, which we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the sifach is extended: then it is softened, and the place is stitched, and it is discovered.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And the care for it is with cauterization, as we have preceeded in its narration.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cared for with iron, according to this method: and it is that it lies weak on its back with your hands above it.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the place of the rupture that has been stitched and discovered, according to the width of three fingers, by section through the length.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tie the alsiaka and the ones that are under the cheek, until when the white sifach, which is under the cheek that follows it, is tightened.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the iron, and place it directly on the prominent part of the sifach, and press it down to the depth of the veins.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then make two prominent points at the ends of the iron on the sifach, and sew them together with a stitch from one to the other: then pull out the end of the iron.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not burn or stretch the sifach at all, nor tear it, nor anything else, as I have shown you to know in the treatment of intestinal gangrene.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat that wound with the treatment of the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you then burn the thread, clean it and restore the wound until it is healed.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The sifach then contracts and does not add to the depth of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cauterium is better in this place: for it is nearer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	¶ About the softening of the testicular skin.
Caput LXVIII.	¶ Caput LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because the flesh that is between them is also softened and its appearance is deformed.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is being asked to treat it to make the weak lay on his back and press all the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then gather together the two lips with a stitch: and if you will, make at first three stitches on the excess skin of the softened skin, or four, and then make a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then press between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat the other wounds with the treatment of the wound until they are healed and the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	¶ About castration.
Caput LXIX.	¶ Caput LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that castration is forbidden by our law and for that reason I will not remember it in this book: and it is not necessary to remember it unless for two ways.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	And the other is that the physician may know of it when asked about it, and to know the treatment for the one who happens to it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other mode is that we often indicate castration of certain animals for our pleasure through this, such as rabbits, Hyrcanians, and goats, and like animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say then that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by cutting and sectioning.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In those that are made by attrition, there is a part of the operation: which we make the animal to sit in warm water, until the testicles of it be softened and relaxed, and hang down: then we gently press them with your hand, until they be resolved and not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by cutting and sectioning, it is necessary to hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensorium, and dry it over all the cut section at once, until the two wounds have grown: then cut it after you have exfoliated both, and do not leave anything on it above the sifac, which is on the wound.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this mode of castration is better than that which is made by attrition: because attrition may leave something in the testicles, therefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it be healed.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	¶ About the care of the hermaphrodite in two ways.
Caput LXX.	¶ Head LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is formed from two modes of the male and female generative organs.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	The appearance of their genitals is such that it resembles the shape of a woman's, with hair-like structures in the area between the testicles, and at times they urinate from that same area.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is a single species, and it resembles the shape of a woman's breast, as if it were a small testicle entirely projecting beyond the surface: of which one is like a priapus testicle, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	The treatment of the three species, two from the male genitals and one from the female, is necessary because it must add flesh to their parts until the impression of their parts escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then, care for them with the care of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine issues that is in the area between the testicles, there is no operation, nor is its treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	¶ About the incision of the Tentex and the fleshy parts of the woman's vulva.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Perhaps the Tentex is added to the natural part until it becomes ugly and unsightly: and at times it is so magnified in some women that it expands as in men, and reaches orgasm.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, it must be held the excess of the Tentex with your hand, or with a blade, and cut, and at times in the incision, especially in the deep root: so that there may not be a flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then, care for the wound with the care of the wound until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But flesh is the flesh that is born in the opening of the womb, until it fills it: and perhaps it issues from the outside according to the likeness of the tail: and for this reason some call the first lumbagism.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary then that we apply it as we apply Tetanus, and care for it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	¶ Regarding the care of the gallbladder, which is not perforated in a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is, whether it be a small gallbladder in a woman not perforated, or a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural, or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental it is from the disease that precedes it: and this itself is either from added flesh, or thin down, or spindle-like; and it is either in the deep matricula, or in its sides, or in the upper part of itself, or in the lower part of itself; and it prevents conception and impregnation, and labor, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of it is made through the appearance of the midwife, if the poverty is apparent near.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with the radius.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the poverty is from a thin down, and it is near the two lips: then immediately, and break it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as you will place on the two lips two thin flaps.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands simultaneously, and the woman should be on her back with her legs extended.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with strength, until the thin down is broken and the poverty is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool, and drink it in oil, and place it on the place: and let the woman wear it all day, so that the place does not harden another vine.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the down is thick and spindle-like: then it is necessary to cut it with a leaf of myrtle similar in width to the spatula.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If indeed poverty is from the flesh born, then suspend it with gut, and cut it: and there should be with you in medicine those that are settled without cutting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus gathered with testicle.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a canula from the lead, so that the fistula does not stick together too quickly, hold it for a few days: and administer linen from dry flax, then treat the remaining care with care, until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when some flesh is born from the womb of another: it must be cut according to this manner: while there is no cancerous growth in the womb, which is a cancerous growth, there should be no opposition with iron altogether.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	¶ Regarding the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red pimples in women's wombs.
Caput LXXIII.	Head LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Indeed hemorrhoids are the openings of the fallopian tubes, until much blood flows out of them frequently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore they become enlarged, they are called hemorrhoids: and as I said in the division of their kinds, and signs of them, and I will say now which of them receive treatment and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I therefore say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and are not seen by sight: then there is no treatment with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are in the opening of the womb which are felt by touch, are those which are treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore it is necessary to take the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athehelil with thorns, or with a rough cloth, and cut them off from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then apply a poultice made from the above-mentioned herbs to the wound, without causing any inflammation: just like acacia, and dragon's blood, and pitch, and so on of these.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press the foot of that animal against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, put that animal in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists, then make it sit in a decoction of sumach, and the bark of the gorse, and the galls, and such like.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take flour of barley, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on the back of that animal.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If the blood is discharged with it, that is good: and if not, make the belly and breasts stick to the wound without causing a scar.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and dip it in the juice of tartar, or the juice of arnoglossum, or the juice of the leaves of the alder tree, that is, the bark, and make it stick to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the abscess has ceased, then care for the place with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	However, blood is similar to the hair of the alder tree, and has a sharp appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, you must burn it according to what I said earlier, equally: and care for it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	¶ Of the perforation of the exit which happens in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Head LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	There will happen in the womb many kinds of abscesses, such as cancer, and stone-like abscess, and ulcers, and cuts, and gangrenous, that is, herpes, acne, hemorrhoids, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragweed, and thymele, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	I have already said all these diseases and their species, and their signs and the cures for them in division: it is necessary to say again in this treatise on hot afterbirth that occurs in the uterus, when it is from healthy afterbirths that are collected, and you want to know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it must be considered.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if pain in the afterbirth is sharp when it touches itself with percussion, and flame, and fever: and you see it reddens: if it falls on itself with sense, then do not hurry with its perforation: and care for it with that which flows over the maturation, until when it rests, sharpness of the accident accumulates.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that the woman be made to sit on the seat which is greased with two chairs, and is reclined, or is laid down on her back, and draws her feet towards the lower part of the belly: and her hips should be expanded, and she should put her arms under her knees, and lie down on both sides with the straps that are convenient for it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit at the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the uterus is made.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes to those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you want to administer this instrument that you see with the radio deep in the uterus of the woman: so that what goes in through the instrument is not more than deep in the uterus and harms the weak one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is greater than deep, then it is necessary to put cloths on the deep uterus: so that the introduction of the instrument into the whole does not happen: and it is necessary that it put the curdle on the side above: and that it holds the instrument, and that it rotates the curdle until it opens the deep uterus.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore it appears that the wound is closed and touched with the hand, and it is soft and mild: then it should be left alone at its own head with a damp cloth on one side.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the sanies are discharged, then it should be applied to the elbow with a submerged leeches in rose oil: or in viridian oil which contains some stiptics: and place the leeches, and extract the section from the deep matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally over the matrix, and over the clean submerged wool in water where the bullfleas are small.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be dressed after two days with an ointment that adheres to it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the elbow and elbow are washed so that they are clean with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily or long aristolochia is: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	That if the elbow has been hidden inside the matrix, then it should be prevented from being cured with iron, even with the care of that which I mentioned in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	In the Art of Midwifery, how midwives deal with living children, according to the figure not natural exit.
Caput Lxxu.	Head 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to first recognize the natural figure of the part.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore from the signs, when you see a woman compress herself to the lower part, and desires to smell the air, and moves over it which is above her of the part, and hastens the exit of the embryon: then you know that this part is according to the natural figure, and its exit is on her head, and the second with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, it then becomes necessary for the intestine to be compressed, so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	When it has descended over its own head, the second follows it, and is cleaned of the surplus by good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	However, if it is beyond this part, it is unnatural and unpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the foetus escapes beyond the feet of its own body, and escapes its own body before its head, and feet, and hand, or one of its hands: or its head and hand: or its entrail part, and it may turn over on its back, and such like from unpraiseworthy figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in all these matters, and to avoid error and deception. And I am showing you all the figure, and how the ingenuity is in it, and what it signifies by this, and turns over on it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the foetus escapes of its own natural escape, and it is over the woman, and it becomes difficult for him to give birth, and you see his virtue already weakened: then make him sit on a seat, or let women hold him: and if it is a male child, mix it with the corn-dough of barley, and with the oils of the oil.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife inserts her hand between her fingers, and finds with it the second part, and anoints it with her own nail, until what is in it from moisture dries out: and presses the woman's belly, until the foetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then it is necessary to apply a poultice of woman to barley dough with olive oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command him to swallow it, and make it hiss with condiments, and hold his mouth and nose for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The foetus will immediately come out.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands come out first, it is necessary to gently reduce them with ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If she does not obey during the introduction, then place the woman on the bed, and lift her feet up: then press the bed on the ground: and hold her so that she does not fall due to the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not come out, and the foetus dies: then incise them, and remove the remaining foetus: and tie her hand with a cloth, and remove it with equality, for it will also come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo from its own foot.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the foetus comes out from its own feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards: then turn the foetus gently: and then hold it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then let her take one of its feet, and extend it gently.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out until the thighs, then command him to swallow it, and make it hiss with condiments: for he will come out if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not come out with the one we mentioned, then gently reduce the foetus: until you place it according to the natural figure.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will come out then by easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is prohibited when coming out with the one we mentioned, then take from the ointment of althea, and olive oil, and dissolved gum: and rub all in the mortar with good percussion: then line it with a woman's vulva, and below her breath.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then place her in warm water until the poultice takes effect.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that the lower parts of it are heated, then apply myrrh to it, and put it on.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she has held the poultice for an hour, then place her on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sniff the poultice: and bind her nose and mouth: and press on the lower part of the nostrils with ease.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fire will soon escape.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The child's exit over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When she exits according to this form, then insert her hand gradually into it.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie down on her chest, and let her feet hang down, and she should lie on her back with her hands folded.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press on her nostrils gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then take out what is under her feet from the pussy-willows, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If she does not exit the child, then take her feet and move them with a strong motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press on what is above the poultice gradually, until the child rises to the upper part.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert her hand gradually, and gently push the child until she compresses, until the child exits.

Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	She is inserted in the reduction of her hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If she cannot reduce it, then make the woman walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk, then place her on the bed: and rub her legs with a strong blow.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment you prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If he takes it (the child), then make him sit on the seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study on the reduction of the hand, and make the child equal in size according to the natural figure: and order the woman to swallow it, and tell him to wrap himself up until he goes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The child's exit over its own neck, with extended hands, and its face is towards the back of its mother's.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary for the midwife to hold onto the child's hand, then gently roll it around, and ease it with facility.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equal, then place on top of its thighs which we mentioned from oil and mucilage.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then tell him to move slightly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you will do this, then make him sit on the seat, and tell him to lean towards the right side.

¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The child's exit prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it comes down to the mother's opening according to this method with the second one, then cut the second one with your nail, until it dries out from moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is hung over the face of the child and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it will not hold on, and it will die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the child inside, until you place it according to what is necessary: and tell the woman to wrap herself up several times: for he will go out by watery excrement.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of the twins, or of many children.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are born frequently: and sometimes they are born three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is foreign, and does not often happen.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five there are which are beyond nature and do not exist entirely: and they contain them, however many they may be, as one second: and they are separated by the sifah, distinguishing between them, tied in the umbilicus of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they go out as the infant goes out by the natural way, easily: and they go out by an unpraised way, as we have said.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult at the time of parturition and go to that which we said in figurative language, then take care of them as we have said: and it is because of the subtle thief, and let her do what she does with facility and delay, and act according to every figure with that which is prepared for her by the artist leading her to health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	¶ Rememberance of this which is formed in the matrix from the embryos, and they are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When it forms in the matrix one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and eight, and nine, and more than ten: and I have already heard from me that a woman aborted and emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which has been done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore this whole thing should be in the knowledge of the Obstetrical sciences.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will be eager for that similar one, and therefore puts it opposite to that with it, what should be.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	¶ About the extraction of the dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Head 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are caring for the dead fetus when it does not go out with that which we said in division by medicine, and does not go out, and you hold it by hand, then it is necessary to consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If then the woman is healthy vitality, and not with any of the accidents which are feared for her loss: then it is necessary that the woman be laid on the bed, on his back, and let his head be inclined downwards, and his legs be raised up. And the attendant shall hold her from two parts, or lie down at the bed, so that her body is not drawn out during the extraction of the foetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then hydrate the woman's bones with soft oils, such as olive oil and magnesium, and linen seeds.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should anoint her hands with these oils and magnesium, and then insert it into the woman's womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should look for that place where it forms knots from the fetus, and a convenient place for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore consider now if the fetus is prepared to come down from its head: then tie knots in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its shoulder, or in the nearby costal regions, and under the hip bones.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	However, if the descent is over its feet: then in the chest, and in its ribs in the middle.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the knot with her right hand: and she should place her thumb on the part between the fingers of the left hand: and she inserts it with her hand with ease, and ties the knot in some of those places that I have mentioned, until it reaches the womb.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she should tie another knot on the opposite side, or a third one if needed, so that the contraction is equal and does not move to a part.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then the extension should be equal and not be an extension only by straightness, but it should move to all parts so that its exit is smooth, as happens with a tooth during its removal.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	It is necessary for it to be among those so that it is softened by extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part is drawn from it, then it is necessary for the midwife to apply some fingers with oil and insert them from the side, so that she can rotate with them what is held.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If the part of the fetus is drawn out, then the bands should be turned over to another place that is higher: do this until the whole fetus has passed.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If the hand is drawn out beforehand and it cannot be reduced because of its tightness: then it is necessary for the cloth to be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then draw it out until it has passed the whole: cut it either in the joint of the finger or in the elbow: and then it is necessary for you to do the same with the other hand, and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the head of the fetus is large, or it happens to it in the way out, or there is water gathered in its head: then it is necessary for her to insert between the fingers a Spatumile spiny sand, and find the head with it and draw out the water: or to break it with the instrument called Almisdac: which comes with the forms of other instruments in the head that is after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus is of a large head nature, then it is necessary for her to cut the amniotic fluid: or to take it out with the midwife's forceps as I have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then she should draw out the bone with the forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head is drawn out and it tightens at the shoulder: then she should find it until the moisture that is in the chest is spent.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however she does not admit, nor obeys to the way out: then cut the head in pieces according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower part of the throat is affected by an abscess or there is hydrops there, then it is necessary to open it until the moisture runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If indeed the fetus is above its feet, then the attraction of its head is easy and the direction of its chin towards the mother's forehead is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is twisted at the throat or chest, then it is necessary to take it out with the cloth that you have wiped on your hand, and find the throat or chest until the moisture runs out of it.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the remaining limbs return to the head, then the midwife inserts her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the mother's forehead is open, then she inserts her hand into the mother's forehead, and looks for the head with it, and takes it out with her fingers up to the mother's forehead, then she inserts a thong or two thongs into it and takes it out with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mother's forehead is twisted because of a hot abscess that happens to it, then it does not need to labor over it, on the contrary, it needs to give an effusion of watery and greasy things at that time: and apply plaster: and sit in warm and moistening water.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is above its own side, then it is possible to equalize it: then it is given what I said in the fetus broth.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then it is crushed and taken out piece by piece.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary to keep nothing from the second inside entirely.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then give what I said in hot abscesses that happen to the mothers.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If blood flow occurs, then let it descend into steam baths and administer the remainder of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have seen a woman, whose womb had previously given birth to a dead foetus: she then became pregnant again on top of that same vessel, and later the other foetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	It happens to him after a long time a furuncle in his belly button, which has swollen, until it is opened, and he begins to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I am called to treat him, and I have been treated for a long time: and the wound has not yet healed.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I then applied some strong plasters of attraction over it: and the tooth moved out of its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then some days passed, and another tooth moved out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was surprised then, because there is no tooth in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought that they were from the bones of the dead foetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I then examined the wound and extracted many bones, a woman existing in better positions of her own: and she has already healed like this for a long time, and she sends out a little pus from its place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I have not firmly held this strange thing, unless there is knowledge in it, and an aid to that which the skilled artisan doctor does with his hand from treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	¶ About the necessary forms of instruments in the extraction of the foetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Caput LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Below is the form of the Strictor, according to which the two sides of the two logs are equalized by two teeth at their extremities.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this tooth should be made to be softer than the Strictor: and it should be made either from ebony or from the wood of the basswood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	The extent of any wood is almost like two fingers: and the margin of each branch is almost one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half, and in the middle of two branches there are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already become firm in both, whose length is a half palm and a little less, and the width of both is almost two fingers, or a little less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	This two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother, so that it opens with them when you roll over the two vertigo.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of vertigo that opens the mother.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to this, softer and more lewd.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made from hazelwood or bBay leaf, according to the likeness of a claw.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	Indeed, at the end there are two additions as you see above: and the length of all additions from them is like a palm: and the width of both is almost two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you wish to open the mother with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, with her legs hanging down, and keep the one that is between her thighs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two combined additions into the mother: and you are holding the end of the instrument below between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with thorns, equally according to the amount that you want to expose of the mother's mouth, until the midwife wants to do it that she wishes.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Another form of vertigo than what the ancients said, is the form of the pusher by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almidace, by which the large head is crushed: and it is similar to a claw, with teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	When it comes to cutting, as with the Iliad according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like those of a saw, on which it is cut and ground.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almizak, on which the head of the small animal is cut and ground.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of the Uncini has one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of the Uncini has two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of the uterus, which has teeth like those of a saw, on which the head of the fetus is cut and ground.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of the Spathemis has two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two Spathemis and also of the scars.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments will be used, and the more they multiply their species, and the more prepared they are at the craftsman's hand, the more successful it is for their operation, and higher among men, because of the quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not despise any of these instruments, which is prepared at your hand.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is inexcusable for their necessity.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Regarding the extraction of the second child.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second child is held during delivery, then it is necessary to take the weak ones, so that they can retain their thirst.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make it hiss with the condiment: and stretch your hand over its mouth, and the nostrils of its own.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If then it goes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take the oil, and perforate in the cover of the wound: and put in it opening leaves of the matricaries, such as linen, rosemary, and camomile, and sage, and hazelnut, and linen cord, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a bolus of barley over the flask's cover, and place another end in the matrix's socket: and hold it until it flows to the unity of the matrix.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make it hiss, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The second part will come with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If, however, it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then advise the obstetrician to dip her hand in oil of sweet almonds, or in strong mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should insert into the vagina and search for the second part with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she finds it, then take it and extend it slightly.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If, however, it is anchored in the deep socket of the matrix, then she should insert her hand according to what we have said until she finds the second part and pulls it out slightly according to the straight line, so that the matrix does not fall due to the strong attraction: indeed, it should be turned with ease to the right and left side: then add to the degree of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	The matrix obeys at this point and is drawn out, and is released from its attachment.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the socket of the matrix is hunched, as we have mentioned: treat it with sternutation and with the oil of herbs from the flask.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it does not come out with all that we have mentioned, then be careful not to tire from the extraction in its repeated sessions.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Indeed, it should be tied to the woman's bed when it comes out of the socket.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then apply a plaster to it with the tetrapharmacontremedy ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	The plaster will decay it in days, and it will dissolve and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	When putrid, it is believed that this smell comes from the stomach and head, and harms the weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, suitable suffumigations should be given for this.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Certain ancient ones have already found the suffumigation of nasturtium and fig sugar to be effective.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument used for the suffumigation of a woman during the retention of the second child and the menstrual period.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made like a small censer, or from zere: and the wide end is placed over the fire: and the suffumigation is placed over the prunes: hold it until the first suffumigation is consumed: and then another one is taken.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Regarding the treatment of unperforated Ani.
Caput LXXIX.	Head LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their Ani are not perforated, which the poor woman has already used with a fine thread.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife should perforate it with her own thumb: and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp sponge: and let her be careful not to touch it with the lap.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it a lamb's fat, well-infused in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If you fear that the poor woman is about to give birth, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and take it when the boy wants to give birth.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And labor pains of the Ani also occur even from the consolidation of the wounds, or from the stitches.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it should be followed by the consolidation of that, and then it is cared for with what we said about the treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Regarding the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Wounds that occur in the lower part are called fistulas, and they can be either superficial or deep, near the anus: they can occur in a single space or multiple spaces.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that superficial fistula becomes old, it opens up and discharges clear white moisture or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	Sometimes there are penetrating fistulas from these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, penetrating fistulas are recognized by the discharge that exits through weak excretion and moisture, and perhaps it comes out from the wombs.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they are penetrating fistulas when they extend to the uterus and to the virga of the female.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating fistulas when they extend to the joint of the thigh and to the node at the end.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From the one by which the penetrating fistula to the anus is known, even if it is not penetrating, is, that you insert your thumb into the anus: and you insert a thin tentacle into the fistula from the air or iron, when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin tentacle into it from the leg, or a spear from the hair of horses, until you feel the tentacle, or the spear in your thumb.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it completely, and nothing comes out of the opening, neither moisture, nor pus, nor wombs as I said before, then you know that it is not penetrating: therefore, to the care.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating to the uterus or to the virga of the female, then its significance is the exit of urine from it, and its prohibition from this in order that the place may heal with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If the wound is deep into the thigh, up to the hip joint or to the hip bone: then the sign of this wound is that it pains as it enters, but there is no twist around the hip bone, and there is always the exit of pus from this part, and it does not seem to benefit from dressing, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these fistulas there is no care at all: and the care of them is labor and uselessness, from the foolish physicians, under whom they are formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In those which are not deep and not old, hope for cure with a bandage: according to what I tell you, and which I have proved, it is that the patient should lie weak between your hands on his back: and raise his thighs above his hips, and his hips should be inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert a lead or air probe, if there is twist in the fistula, until you know where it pains to enter.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If he however feels it weak around the anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your thumb and indicate with it into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If then you feel with your thumb that it has entered itself, and not between the finger and the thumb, or between the flesh: then you know certainly that it is deep: therefore you do not labor in it, because it is not its cure, as I have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, they say that it is cured in some men by flesh, and from the medicine which is hoped for, it is that a small cauterization according to the size of the fistula, as before, and the hot one is inserted into the fistula until it pains around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then do that twice or three times until you know that all those added flesh filtrates, which are similar to the feather of a pen, have become ash.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then take care of that with honey-soaked linens in butter, until those flesh come out, which have become ash: then take care of it with ointments making flesh and solidifying.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If then it heals, that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it does not heal with any other treatment ever.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it pushes out, and does not go through until the tip of your finger, which is in the anus, and it is between them and the sponge made from flesh, or sifac: then you will see the fistula that follows on the surface of the skin, then dry the skin at the beginning of the fistula, and you cut with it as you pull out what is in the fistula until it becomes wet where the end of the pull comes out, and the fistula liberates and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those flesh filtrates, which are similar to the feather of a pen, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	However, if blood flows from you and dissolves between you and the operation you do on it, then it is better that what happens, and your diet becomes lighter, to cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For cauterization with fire unites good associations, adds the ash of those flesh, and the abscission of blood, and the drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then take care of that with honey-soaked linens in butter, or with the trituration of wool, until the place emits pus, and those flesh come out into pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then deal with the wound with hardening ointments, which generate tough flesh: and these are the remedies in which there is cauterization and excoriation.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	When they have been restored, then they are already cured: and there is no need for repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	However, if the fistula has already become inflamed down to the depth of the anus, and extends beyond the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and explore with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If you then feel a test, and between you and it is a layer of skin, or flesh, and it is near to penetration: then there is no operation in that place, unless according to the confidence and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it is given in that place one of three modes: either to cauterize it, as I said: or to leave it, until you have reached conglutination, so that it may be possible for you to insert your finger into the wound, and curement from the nearest.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cut, so as not to cut the firm thigh of the anus, and it may happen to the weakest exit of excretion without willingness.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then deal with that which we have said about this.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be cured: or elongate it, and cleanse it after you have removed it as far as the anus, as I said, or when you try, or with another sharp-edged end.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh which is in the cut, until you can with excision.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then dare to restore the wound of the whole with the cut, and the higher opening where it is consolidated: and there will remain an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be more leu.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when the fistula suits this mode: and it is, when you insert the test into the fistula: and it is in the side of the anus near to the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus: then receive the perforated end which is like a feathered arrow, that is, prepared coria according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	You should insert the thread that has been withdrawn from five fingers approximately around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the thread gently into the fistula until it becomes united.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it is passed through the margin or inside, then pull out the thread from that hole: so that you insert your thumb into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and tie the two ends together: and string them together and let it be for one day, or two days: and as much as the thread penetrates into the flesh, tie it well, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread falls off and drops down: then care for the wound until it is healed and cured.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If the opening of the fistula is not easily penetrated: then make it penetrate in whatever way you can prepare it for yourself, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you do not have the power to do this by your thumb, so as not to harm it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then make it as I have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the Spatium Milanese in which the fistula is found, whose edge is sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not penetrate what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	¶ About the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and care for the cuts.
Caput LXXXI.	Head 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are within the anus, similar to wool of carbon or prunes: or they are like grains of salt.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And among them there are small and large ones: and blood always runs from them, it is one, and they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	There are some outside and at the extremities of it.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus, are of a few wetnesses, from which runs the white water, or little blood flow repeatedly: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of it which is inside the anus, is like a weak person who has been beaten: and it is shown until the anus has gone out, and you will see that the flesh is reddish to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also suspend them with thongs: or hold them with your own nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them near their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they are not held by the thongs, because of their wetness and their own softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a comb made of wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and sprinkle on them some hot creams after cutting them, so that they hold their place at the cauterization site.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what is written in the chapter of cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not yield to the exit, then apply a weak clister on the part where there is a small biting, so that it may leave with it what is in the anus, and it will obey the exit quickly, when it presses itself weakly.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if they are red and outside the anus, then their case is easy and easy to grasp: and it is as if you could take them with your own nail, or with a thong, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what I have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever loathes the cutting with iron, then it is necessary to apply a suture to them according to this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a loop of thread and insert it into the abscess.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then extract the thorn from its upper part, and make it pierce with the point of the knife into the root of the other side: and fold over the two ends of the thread, on to the point of the knife, and make them be even; and tie the thorn strongly closed.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then take a knot in the thread, and remove the knife.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the thorns, and let out one of them; do not allow it to draw blood from its own side.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rose or cinnamon oil on the other side, and place the thread over it; and tell the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Let it go until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the thorns fall off, care for them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	¶ On the Care of Wounds.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Indeed, they often occur due to dryness of the dung and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they become large and do not respond to medicine, then it is necessary to moisten the rings with salt or with your own grease until they become moist, and remove the upper bark that prevents them from being compacted.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they are compacted according to what is appropriate.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not compact: then repeat them with a stronger reason than before, until they bleed much and are cared for, until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	¶ On the Treatment of Wounds that Turn and Do Not Turn, and of Burned and Ants' Nests.
Caput LXXXII.	Caput LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is not but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head that clings: it is made throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and it happens with them pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It must then be cut off from its surroundings and held with needles, or with a scalpel, and it must be removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then, take care of that: and if you wish to cauterize it according to what is prescribed in the chapter on that subject.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	However, from the fleshy parts, one is small, rough, perforated, round above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often they happen in the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	The treatment of it is to extend the athelil, and then incise it: or thread it with a silk thread from the hair: or with wool, until it falls down.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was prescribed with fire, or with sharp medicine: and already eradicated are the turned-up athelil, and not turned-up with the instrument that I will say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	However, an ant is also small, rough, large, below the surface of the body, creeping down into the gutter: and when it encounters cold, it feels as if stung by a wasp, and it becomes throughout the body: and most of it happens in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	The treatment of it is to take a quill from the goose, or a strong wing feather: and place that quill over the ant, until it forms a circle from parts of itself.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then roll your hand with the quill, until that which is in the surrounding circle of the ant leaves: and place it in the deep flesh, and remove the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do this with a quill of copper, or iron, in this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the quill be above the canula, drawing it down softly wrapped around the thumb and its own rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	If you wish to cauterize Ants according to what has been previously mentioned regarding cauterization of the Athel in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	¶ Of the forms of instruments that are used for clysters in diseases of the anus, and for the vent, and for colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Whenever a clyster is made from silver, or from argentium alloy, or from melted copper, or from iron.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes a small clyster instrument is made from these, and a large one, according to those which are used for administering them.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is used in the treatment of young children should be small, and for those whose ani are weak, or painful, so also should be the clyster for them.
Clistere magnum.	Large Clyster.
Cistere paruum.	Small Clyster.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The mouth of this clyster, that is, the part above where the uterus is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and it should have a distinction so that it may be placed on the uterus as you see, and the lower end which is inserted into the anus should be sharp, that is, not open, soft, gentle, drawing towards subtlety: and in one side of it there should be two holes, and in the other side a single hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the hole should be according to the size of the radii, and smaller in the middle, and the uter in which the medicines are placed from the raw animal matter, or from the sheet of the ox, which is according to the form of a small asafetida: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be perforated through many holes as it revolves, and there should be a space between every hole which is the size of the digit.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert the thread into those holes firmly from a thread of raw silk, which is about ten, or so, and gather up with it the uterus as that of asafetida.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When it comes to the female, the strings are fastened in the head of the clitoris between the two distinct constrictions of the strong band.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then the stringing of the clitoris follows.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle as depicted here, and the hole.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	However, the quality of the stringing of this is: that it fills the uterus, or is a suction tube from medicine which is heated according to the tolerance of the weak: and be careful not to make it too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the weak is placed on its back, and its legs are raised up: and then a cloth is laid under it, that is, the skin over which men lie, or a linen.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then the end of the string is anointed with oil, or with a gum called albuca, or with honey from the Greek olive, or with something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the helper should take the uterus with both of her hands at once, and express it with force until all that is in the string is emptied into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the string, and raise the weak's legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the doctor thinks it is ready for removal, then hold it as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if it sleeps with it all night, it is the best for healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If you string it in the diseases of the fluid of the stomach, and hasten its exit, then repeat the stringing until it is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful ulcers in the anus, then the string should be fine and warm, made from the strings used to string children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	This is the form of a splint that is fine and delicate above which is a strict skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	The treatment of head wounds without fracturing the bones of the skull.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head LXXXIIII. (This appears to be a reference number or heading for the section on the head.)
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken of the treatment of wounds that were suitable for division in the book, and I will now tell you the treatment of those wounds with my hand and with medicines according to complement. (This sentence is discussing the different methods of treating wounds, including manual manipulation and the use of medicines.)
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I therefore say that wounds are differentiated according to the manner in which they are made and according to the place where the nail falls. (This sentence is discussing the factors that contribute to the classification of wounds, including the cause of the wound and its location.)
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the wounds that are often made are like those made by a falling stone: or by a sword, or by knives; or by a blow with a lance, or with wood, or with an arrow; and similarly from many things. (This sentence is providing examples of common causes of wounds, including those caused by heavy objects, sharp instruments, and projectiles.)
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	However, wounds that are made according to the location of the body are like the nail that falls on the head, neck, chest, heart, or liver: and similar wounds from those parts. (This sentence is discussing the different types of wounds based on their location in the body, including those that affect the head, neck, chest, heart, and liver.)
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am now telling you about the treatment of some wounds so that I can lay down a reasoning and rule for the rest of the wounds. (This sentence is introducing the discussion of specific wound treatments as a way to establish a framework for treating other wounds.)
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with the simple head wounds: for the recall of the authors will not be at the beginning of the third chapter. (This sentence is explaining that the author will start discussing specific types of head wounds before addressing other types of wounds, as the authors' works may not be relevant to the early part of the chapter.)
Dico ergo.	I say then. (This sentence is introducing the discussion of a specific type of head wound.)
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head, and there is no fracture of the bones: then consider if it is from a fall of stone, or similar, and has only scratched the skin: and it is a large wound, and fear for the poor outcome of the hot applications: then immediately and the cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay this: and extract it from blood according to the strength of its virtue: if it does not prohibit anything from phlebotomy, especially if it is blood that is coming out of the wound a little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let him beware of being overfed, and of being gluttonous, and of eating heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If however he forbids any reduction, then it will be less from food, and will not approach flesh, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And if a hot application is applied to the wound, let it be placed on top of the wound with a warm ointment alone, or with wine which has saponification in it.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If however you are cautious about the hot application, then place on top of the wound if it is recent with its own blood, and has not changed the air, the boy whom I will tell you about a little later: and if it has changed the air, then place on top of it some ointment until it recovers.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If however the wound is large, or is from a cut with a sword, and similar: and the lips do not come together with flaps, then gather them together with the suture, according to what I will tell you about the sutures of the entrails.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If however the wound has already been detected from the bone, and hangs down, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspensory: then cut it down.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then take care of the elbow with medicines, and restore the hard flesh in its place instead of the skin, and tell the patient to eat foods that are rough like the head, such as wheat cooked, until it is tender, and similar ones.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If I find putridity in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut out the entire putrid part and remove it, and then care for that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, there is an artery or a vein through which blood flows in these wounds, and it does not heal with medicines, then investigate the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If I find it not cut, then dry it with Spahtum, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the necessity calls for it when it does not heal what I said, then cauterize it, until the blood is abscessed.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however these wounds are small and simple, then the care of them is easy, light: so that this child supports it over it, because it solidifies it before it changes the air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	§ Method of the Child's Flesh.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe: Mix one part of olibanum, and two parts of the unburned blood of a dragon, and three parts of unburned lime, and let it all be mixed well and heated, and fill the elbow with it, and bind it tightly with a good binding, until it adheres well on top of it, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it up from above with the child's hair, and let it go, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not slip off.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For this medicine will not be removed from it until it is cured.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it has made the calx alone, when there is no olibanum with you, and the blood of the dragon, and even makes this operation in many of the great wounds, when it comes to be laid on them and bound, and the wounds are recent with their own blood, which has not changed the air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If he has already altered this air with some other alteration, especially when it is in the time of childhood, then his intention is not in the position of this child at that time. Therefore, take care of it as we have said, so that you put something digested on top of it: either put something made from dough of barley, made with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then, take care of the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If indeed it happens with a small bone fracture in the bones, and it is small, then extract it with the help of the Gestalt: and I will already say the treatment for skull fractures in what I will tell you.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	¶ About Neck Wounds.
Caput LXXXV.	Head 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If however a fracture occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between the two, and when it is simple in the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If however the nerve of the neck has already been cut, or the artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no ingenuity in it unless it is to give its treatment with an intense stimulant, such as zinc, and mercury, and similar drugs.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because nerves are harmful and they contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the fracture: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is above the members: and that which is treated with medicines should be gentle, as limestone with water several times infused with oil, or with rose oil and thyme, when it is dry again with sweet water: and other mineral stones in this way, and wet ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If however the fracture is large, then administer a suture: or cut the lips of it with children's lips.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then he should carefully attend to it until it is cured.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If indeed the wound is deep, or it happens to be in a hollow in the lower part of the wound, where already pus has gathered, then he should make an opening in that more depressed place in the wound.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If indeed the artery in the muscle has been cut, and blood has followed: then separate or dry it, or tie it; or cauterize it if the need arises for that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If indeed the neck of the throat has been cut, or the whole thing, and the wounds are healed: then gather the edges of the skin with the suture above the throat bone, and do not touch the throat, I mean as even as possible, and return it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten it accordingly, and release it after a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then he should attend to it with ointments in which there is stipulation and exudation until it is cured.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If indeed the bone has made an impression in the bone, then examine it: then if there are fragments of bones in it, remove all of them, or as much as you can: and what is not prepared, release that, until the wound putrefies, and separate and discharge the exit of its growth.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If indeed the wound is recent, then dress it with the plaster that I have mentioned.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If indeed a bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula forms: then attend to it with the one who comes to mind in the chapter of that.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	¶ About the wound in the sheets.
Caput LXXXVI.	Head 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If indeed the wound is from a lance or an arrow: and you see its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If then, from the elbow, vapor arises when the feeble one desires from it, then you know that the elbow is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If not there is depth, and it is recent with its own blood: then you will not put in it the first hour's baby, nor string it up so that it does not retain blood in the depth of it, and turns back to the heart, and kills the weak one: but put in it in itself attracted ointment, and dissolve it in two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If however ointment is not present with you, then put in the opening of the wound a dry bread, so that it sucks out that which goes forth from it by moisture: and make it sleep the feeble one on the elbow, so that it runs that which is gathered in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If however three days have passed beyond the wound, or more, and there is no spasm in the weak one, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor stricture in thirst, and you see other good positions of it: then you know that the elbow is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it itself and with wine, and the rest of the treatment, until it recovers.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If however recovery of its salvation is excused, and it has already opened forever, then you know that the fistula has been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore treat it from its chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the elbow is from an incision of a sword or knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest, or back: then treat it with that which precedes from the suture, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression in the bone, and it goes out from it chips: then search the elbow, and before removing those chips, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If I am indeed not separated, then release it, until the wound puts out, for its extraction will be made.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	However, the judgment of the accidents of its wounds in the remaining limbs is the one we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	¶ About wounds of the stomach, and the exit of the intestines, and their extraction.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that happens to the small intestine is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore, when it occurs from a great intestine, or the number of the intestines, it will escape.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, it is made into insertion of theirs, and their suture is more difficult and more painful.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption is also made difficult by another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it should be made easier to reduce them if you do not immediately go to the intromission of their own place: for it swells, opens, and becomes thick: therefore it is difficult to make an introduction of its own.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a better disruption is made of the medium disruption: for when it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is difficult to make it slippery in these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of wounds is according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures are common to the wound suture and the suture of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures are properly shared by the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper when it is a wound suture: and I will tell you one with the exposure and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it back: then it is for one of the two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the rupture's extent, as we said: Or because there is inflammation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When it is so, then it is necessary to heat the part itself, just as you would dip a wet sponge or cloth into warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil the squill, cyperus, and saffron in water, and pour it into the intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	It makes this wine in which there is stitching: and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you see the inflammation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which the althea has been boiled, or the mullein.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For this the entrance of it will be healed when it is small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however the return of its rupture after this treatment is delayed, then find in the rupture a small extent, with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are separated.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than the section: and there is no compulsion to cut after necessity and the lack of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let a part of it be one that is rough and sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the end not be subtle but rather be less than the subtility of althea, indeed it should be more obtuse, and that which resembles caida, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the swelling enlarges and enters the intestine, then it is necessary for it to be reduced according to its natural form in its own place, if possible, on top of that: for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When however the rupture is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary for you to make the weak lie down on its back and place its legs higher than its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	If it is in the upper part of the chest, then place the head of its chest above its lower chest.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	Similarly, if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the chest, then place your intention and consideration always in this, so that the part where the wound is lower is higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And it should be administered in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	However, in small wounds, administer it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it so that it is present between your hands, a faithful servant who will hold the rupture in his hand, and gather its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then pull out from it something that follows the suture after a while, and this is the common method of one suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, as if you take a needle or the number of needles according to the amplitude of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go of the quantity of the finger at the ring's end, that is, the doctor: and take one needle and place it in the thread in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities sifing what is under the skin from the interior, until you make it penetrate from another part, and you have already gathered the two extremities of the skin and the two extremities sifing: and there will be four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with thread twice around the needle several times from two parts at the same time, until the two lips of the wound are gathered together by the method of suturing.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the size of the finger as well, and take another needle in them, and then tie it with thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	You should not cease doing this until you have closed the wound completely with the needle.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The needles should be of medium size between thickness and fineness: for the thin ones wound quickly into the flesh, and the thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin, therefore it is necessary that they be of medium size in both respects.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it should not be figured out in the two ends of the near skin much: so that the flesh is not wounded quickly, and the wound is not opened before the consolidation of its own, and neither are they elongated even with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the sharp end of the needle, so that it does not hurt the weak one in its sleep: and put them in pieces of cloth from all sides, which hold the sharp end of the needle: and leave them until you know that the wound is completely consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of suture with the needle as such is more convenient for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For one or two needles are enough for their sutures.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	However, the second suture is common, where four edges of the skin are gathered together with the two ends of the thread in the same place, with a needle in which the thread is wrapped equally in thickness and fineness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced with the needle these four edges, draw back the needle from the side from which you entered it, so that the thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture be like the suture of a band, and put between all the sutures an amount of thickness less than that of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of suture is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	When I have closed this wound on his elbow which was inflicted by the sword and was a greater tear than half a palm: and it came out about two palms from the middle of the intestines, and it was a tear in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I then reopened it after twenty-four hours when the intestine had stood outside the elbow.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The elbow was then consolidated in the space that was about fifteen days: and I cared for it and it became well: and it returned many years later, coming back to its former position.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that it could not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle, that I did not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in the place where there was no ointment found, nor anything from medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I then laid a old bandage on the elbow twice a day, and made him wash it with honey-water, until it was cured.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will mention two kinds of sutures according to the story told in the speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you begin with a sharp suture: and you introduce the point from outside to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the point of the needle has entered the skin and gone through the tendon according to the length and breadth of the whole body: let the end of the sifac be on the side where you introduced the point, and make it go out from the inner part to the outer part at the other end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you make it go in, then make it go in according to this in the same end: and let the end of the sifac which is on that side be out, and make the point of the needle go in at the other end: and make it go in with the going in of your point in the sifac end which is on that part, until it goes through the whole.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then proceed and also remove the same side, and take hold of its own edge that is from the side opposite to the one it has penetrated, and extract the splinter from the edge that has been pierced.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce it to that edge, and take hold of its own end that is on the opposite side, and mirror it with this end: and extract it from the edge that is on its side, and make them all equal in size according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this stitch is that it should be like the stitches of pelt hair, where the hair of the pelts is attached: so that its ends on one side of the skin are equal, and you release them on the other side until it is complete.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Secondly, the stitch of the same kind that he said Gale.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is the report of his speech that he said, that it should be like the example that some doctors use, in such a way that they gather all parts suitable for comparison by nature, and they put the end of the sifac on its other end, and the end mirach on the end of its other side.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And it is done according to what I told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary to make the splinter in the edge nearest to you from the outside, and make it pierce into the inner part of that same spot: and release the two ends of the sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then roll the splinter, and make it pierce from the outside to the inner part in both edges of the sifac, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then roll them both, and make them pierce from the inner part to the outer side in the two edges of the mirach that are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	This is the best method of suture, as it is easier and simpler than common suture, and is the suture that precedes rememoration.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	Therefore, this is also the sermon of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	Some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the heart is corrected with two incubators.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	This is, that you insert one thread into each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from what is near to you, and make it pierce through to another side, according to the suture of those who wear coriaceous girdles equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you know that when the disruption is in the middle of the heart: then the suture of it is harder than the other parts of the heart.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the surgeon's wound is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	This is because when you seize a fresh wound with its own blood, before it changes, and reduce the intestine, and make it straight, and put it on the chest of the unborn child.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already changed the wound: then put some ointments on it, which are near to you, until they form pus: and the threads will fall, and become comfortable, and marvel.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as the cure of the other wounds until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If however, the medicines are not near to you: then put it on immediately, let it begin to emit pus, and the old wound: and turn it over twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicines in many positions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however, you fear that the wound will spread to the principal members of the body in the injury: then it is necessary to dip the cloth in the warm oil, or in the rose oil: and put it on the circumference of the places which are between the thighs, and under the sheets.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then he should apply a poultice of wine with a small amount of black, warm wine, especially if the putridity has already spread throughout the intestine and has made a rupture as far as the cessation.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you know that what is outside the large intestine is easier to cure: and that which is from the small intestine is harder to cure.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the Jejunum does not accept a cure from wine, because it is entirely different: and this is due to the multitude of its veins which are from the stomach, and its size, and due to the thinness of its body, and the proximity of its nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	However, if that which comes from the wine is zirbum, and you have recently taken it, reduce it immediately: reduce it according to the reduction of your own intestines, by which you reduced them equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If space has been lacking, and it has become black or dark: then it is necessary to string it with thread above the place where the blackness was, so that there is no blood flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in zirbum there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that which is beyond the ligament, and hang two ends of the thread from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the attraction of the worm may be drawn towards you, and the extraction of its body at the wound of zirbum, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Reminding of the wound that occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the intestine and is small: it is possible to restore it in some men, because I have seen who was wounded in his belly with the blow of the lance, and he had a right stomach ulcer, and an old one: and a fistula was made, and he excreted feces and wind from it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I have applied the treatment, until I was not occupied with the healing of it: nor did I cease to examine it, until it was healed and the site was solidified.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the site already solidified, I feared the worst that could happen to a weak spot: and it does not happen to him from that evil happening to his inside.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in the better conditions of his body, eating and drinking, and going to the bath, and exercising in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters have said that when it happens in the intestine, and is small: then it should be applied according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	It is, as you take the large ants' heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two lips of the wound, and place one of them, which has an open mouth, over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it is placed on it, and its mouth is tied, the head of his head will be cut off, for it sticks and does not come apart.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant's mouth near the first one, and do not stop doing this while placing the ant after the ant in proportion to the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it again, and stretch his belly.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads will remain attached to the intestine until it is eaten by the intestine, and it will heal, and will not make the weak man worse.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is already possible that the intestine can be applied even with a thin thread: which has been taken out of the animal's intestine, and is attached with it after it is inserted into the abscess.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	It is, as you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it will be carved much.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the end of the thread at its extreme point underneath.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert this thread into the abdomen, and withdraw the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it back to its original position.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with the ants and the intestine is not without the hope and faith.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know, the elbow that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no genius except in subtilization, and there is no healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	¶ About the cure of Zuchemen, and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every elbow, or apostema when it becomes and grows old, and makes a sore, and does not consolidate, and emits pus always, and does not abscess: then we call it universally in whatever member it be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula indeed is according to truth, nodated, filtered, hard, white: with which there is no pain, which is the union of the feather bone: and for this reason some call it Risati, that is, the feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in some hours moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is divided in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and is little: and it is thick, and is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already promised in division, then when I said wound, that every sore which does not heal, and is not born in the flesh of that, is not this except for one cause.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either because of the thinness of blood in the body: or because of its malice: or because there is hard and rough flesh between it and above its lip, preventing the birth of flesh: or because it is full of sord and sordicie: or because the sore is putrid within itself, and the matter which is poured on it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is not helpful in its cure: or because the decaying corpse is in the region, and the pestilence is a kind of this: or through the property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: where difficult digestion of sicknesses occurs, and the healing of the apostema by nature is delayed: or because there is one bone, or the number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	I have already shown you all these causes and signs of the wounds, and the treatments thereof with medicines in division: and it is necessary for me now to show you the treatment of fistulas and abscesses, which are made by the manual operation.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore, you know that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For example, there are fistulas that open into the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or tendons, or intestines, or bladders, or any part of the costal cartilages: or any part of the vertebrae of the back, or any joint composed of bones: such as the hands and feet: and they open into the proximity of the principal member and its like.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, according to this method, the treatment of these fistulas is difficult due to their origin from diseases, and they do not receive treatment, and the occupation with them is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from a fistula of which the depth does not reach to these locations that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to become acquainted with it, then take a tentam from air or iron, if the fistula turns in the right direction, and examine it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin tentam of lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead, when it becomes mild in its own body, and curves around the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to understand about it with a tentam.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, clysterize from those openings from the openings of the fistula.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the humidity with which you clysterize it, runs through other openings, and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then, carefully investigate according to which mode it is possible for you: so that you know that here is a bone, or a nerve, and that the fistula's connection is long or short: or that the fistula is one with many openings, and stands above all of it, with the full strength of your own: with your questioning, as to the weakness, and with your discovery of pain at the compression with your hand on the place, and similarly from the signs and causes of such wounds.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then, when you stand above all that station with truth, then go to the care according to confidence: and it is, as you consider then, if the fistula is nearby visible, or in a place far from the incision, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of those which I said to you: then cut the fistula according to what I have previously mentioned from my narration, and remove what is in it from filtration and decayed tissues, which is born in the opening of its flesh, or thole, and similarly: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If however the fistula is long and deep, and is according to the straightness: then it is necessary for you to cut it into as deep a place as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all the decayed flesh of it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply a bandage on the wounds of sharp medicines: and thrust it as far as the connection of the fistula which you have comprehended with iron: do while that, until the sharp medicine cuts through the whole that remains in the connection of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If however it does not heal by this, then cauterize it according to what we have mentioned.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If then the cause of the fistula is the mouth, and it is certified to you that this is so: then inquire into it and cleanse it according to what I tell you: if nothing prohibits you from anything out of the mind, or nerve, or the principal member, as I have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If then it is discovered to you that the mouth has a corruption and is black: then wash it until the entire corruption of it is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with that which incarnates it, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If then it does not heal and emits pus as before: then you know that you have not succeeded in the complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore wash it over that second time, and make a precise cut of its reasoning, and cleanse it with the last strength of your own.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If then it heals, that is good: and if not, then you know that this corruption is in the deep interior of the body, which you have not followed.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore it is not for you in this unless you release nature itself.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If then the small mouth is corrupted and it is possible for you to draw it with fine sutures which are suitable for that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If then there are many bones, then make a precise cut of their attraction to all of them and do not release anything from them with your own strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If then it creates something for you from the moistures and there is no fear of the cut in them or error: then cut those moistures and flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If then there is not for you a preparation to take the bones from your side: then place on the belly that putsrefies it: and release it until it putsrefies that which is in the circumference of their bones from flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	Guard the wound so it does not scar.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And tie off the incision you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	I recommend placing over it, if you wish, a submerged cork ground with oil; or a submerged cork in Egyptian ointment, or any other white ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	When those moistures become putrid, and the bones separate from them, the removal of those parts, and their attrition is to be practiced.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	However, if the bone is one large one, such as the thigh bone or the hip bone, and that part of it has become corrupted, then that part is a large piece: in that case, rasp it away reasonably until the blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	However, if that which is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to suture it, and press it all the way to the place where the corruption becomes exhausted: then care for it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you, young man, what happens to a boy in his thigh: put this example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	A boy of about thirty years of age had pain in his thigh, caused by something that moved within his body, that is, from the interior, until the matter reached the thigh, and an abscess was formed; and there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, at that time, the error of the physicians extended, until the abscess was opened, and many matters were present with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And then the treatment of his wound was applied, until the thigh became open, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus and moisture from the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	The multitude of physicians was attentive for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of hands, until I was called, and saw his hand, and the materials that were flowing from these openings in great quantities: even the entire body of the patient had been washed, and his skin was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore, let us insert the probe into one of the openings, and try to reach the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to be able to pass through all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Then I proceeded further, and applied myself to one of them, until I detached a part of the bone: and I found it to be corrupted, which was already corroded, and faded, and decayed, and hollowed out, until it had penetrated as far as the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Then I saw what I had found, and the prepared bone from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I concluded that there was no other corruption in the bone, but this decay, and I sawed it.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied the wound healing with solidified medicines over a long space of time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not solidified.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried again, and detached a part of the bone above the first one I had detached: and I found further corruption with the bone, and I sawed what I had seen before, even from that same corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted to heal it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not healed.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Then I detached it again, and did not stop hitting the particular bone, and trying to heal it: and it was not healed until I hit about a palm of bone, and extracted that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with the remedies, and it was quickly consolidated and cured, and this re-operation and section of it was not necessary for the weakness of the infirm, and the fewness of its endurance, and my fear for it due to death, for it happened to it in all hours from the superfluity of the evacuation syncope.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore it was cured by the cure, and a bone was found in its place, and a good disposition was made in its body, and its strength returned to its proper places, and it was turned back into its own dispositions, and it did not cause any harm to its walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	However if an prominent bone is in the place of a broken body: then it is necessary to restore it thus: and it is: take a ligament, and tie it at the extremity of the prominent bone: and instruct someone to extend it upwards: and place another ligament made of wool on top of the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend the end of it to the lower part: and you will hold the flesh over the place where you want to bind it, so that it does not hurt the binding of the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a board or a tablet under the bone below it, because when you do this, it is not forbidden that it may seize the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the binding be over the place of the corrupted flesh to a lesser extent, so that there is not unity between the bone corruption and the binding: and it should not appear in its appearance to the senses, and it should attract to the binding of its gut another binding.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, then at least a part of it continues with its part: and the corruption is in the middle of it or in its own part: then hold the flesh away from all parts of it completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the wooden board below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then cut the wood from the first part where the decay is, until the second cut is continuous from the other side: and the cut should be according to the length of the decay, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the decay is in the joint, cut through the decayed joint and cut the bone where it continues from the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If the decay is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no intelligence except in the cut.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the decay is in the hand or foot pulp, then it is difficult to do it with a tool.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Indeed, you should investigate the decay as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And cut it off, and dress it according to whatever possible method you can, and with whatever skill it corrects itself: when it does not make any opposition to the vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you know that the cutting tools and the saws for this bone are many, according to the position of the bone, and the preparation of them, and their grossness, and their subtlety, and their size, and their wholeness, and their durability, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare all the tools of this operation that are convenient for this operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you know that these operations are significant to you with respect to the kind of tool you use, when you have a long will.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the modes of this art, is a witness of the modes of the diseases: for then you will find that which is convenient to it from the tools to all kinds of infirmities.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I assure you of the last of this chapter, the number of tools that you place examples on which you cut, and the experience you make over another.
Forma Serrae.	The form of the serra (or saw) is described in this section.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another serra (or saw) is also described in this section.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of yet another serra (or saw) is mentioned, but not described in detail.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of the third serra (or saw) is mentioned, but not described in detail.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the serra (or saw) should be drawn with care and attention to detail.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	The arc of this serra (or saw) should be made higher, with the sharpness coming from the metal. The handle should be made from wood, and it should be made in a pyramidal shape appropriately.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the razor's blades is described in this section.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	The head of this razor should be shaped like the stars on its cap (handle), and the points should be like those of an elisechtfegi (a type of surgical instrument).
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not suit unless the heads are sharp when they are joined together and they cut, or if the mouth is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of the larger razor is described in this section.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the medium-sized razor is described in this section.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the wide razor is described in this section.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the razor with which it is sharp is described in this section.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of the other, more subtle razor is mentioned, but not described in detail.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of the razor with curved ends is mentioned, but not described in detail.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of the large, subtle razor is mentioned, but not described in detail.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the razor with which bones are cut is mentioned, but not described in detail.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The form of the large razor is mentioned again.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles the radio (a surgical instrument), and its end is like that of a serra (or saw). It is shown in many locations from the bone.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the razor that is suitable for cutting the bone that has been perforated by the rasure (or saw) is described in this section.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	The tip of this triangle is sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	This is from a medieval Latin translation of an Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis. The phrase "Fit ex Indi." translates to "It comes from India." in English.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And it is fitting that all that we have mentioned be made from razors, and knives, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	¶ Regarding the cutting of the tip and the closure of the bone.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends putrefy, either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When you are treating the decay with medicine and it does not improve: and you see the decay spreading to the member, which does not send out anything: then it is necessary to cut into that member until the decay has spread as far as where the member is weakened by death or by a greater defect in the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that happens to it is that the member is weakened, until it is thought that: that fire has consumed it, or that it has putrefied after being blackened: until the putrefaction spreads to the whole of the member, and grips it.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, when cutting into it, and similarly if the cause of the decay is from the strike of some poisonous creatures, such as scorpions of the sea, and spiders, and wasps, and the like: then it is necessary to do so.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If then the decay or the strike is at the tip of the finger, then cut the finger, and do not leave any space for the decay to spread to the other hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the finger, and do not leave any space for the decay to spread to the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it spreads to the arm, then cut it at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however you observe corruption passing through it, and look at it about the hip: then in that place is the death of the weak.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that, is the quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly, do to the foot, when corruption reaches the finger, then cut it at one of the nodes: and if it reaches the heart of the foot, then cut the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it ascends to the knee, then cut the thigh at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	That is if corruption has already passed above the knee, then there is no intelligence left except release and leaving the weak to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the manner of cutting the limb, or rather binding it, is to draw the ligament in the lower part which you intend to cut, and draw another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And extend the other ligament downwards: and extend another ligament upwards to the top.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And then you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with the sole of your foot, until the whole flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut or bound.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to put on bandages from all sides with linen cloth, and do not let the scarlet touch the healthy place: and the weak wound will heal up with a hot apostematic plaster.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however the flow of blood internally happens while you are working, then cauterize the place slightly: or put on some children's abscessing above it to absorb the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medicine, until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a convenient ligament, and take care of it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you that something happens to the man in his foot, this is the same thing that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What is this, because it happens in his foot, with the ash that resembles the combustion of fire: and that corruption first occurs in his thumb, until it begins to affect the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man arose from himself, after he saw the corruption spreading to his member, which he found from pain and ash: and it spread to the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, it happened to him that same corruption in his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I attempted to recover that excess with the one I had put on his hand after the purification of his body with medicines: and it was not repercussed, and it began to move to another thumb: until it began to corrupt in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to apply it to his hand: and I did not do that, hoping for the cure of his excess from the repercussion of that one: and I feared even the death of him at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the man's virtue was above the accident.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he had despairing of me, he returned to his earth: and came to me from it, because he had been healed, and the corruption spread to his entire hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not seek this narrative, unless it be an aid to that which falls from the generation of this disease: and so that it have a signification, and according to which it is spoken.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Regarding the care of Sinus, and the quality of clisterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 10.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When a gangrene occurs in some of the fleshy parts, and it prolongs the space of the gangrene until the collection of pus: then it bursts, or perforates, and departs from what is in it, and leaves a watery place as if it were water: and the skin which is over it, like a piece of cloth that has been made fine: and it does not reach the end of his corruption, nor imprints in the mouth, nor in the tendons, nor in the ligaments: he deserves to be called Sinus: and it is not called Fistula: but if the space of its gangrene prolongs until it imprints corruption in something of these parts, then it is called Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	The treatment for this is to incise the entire skin in the same direction as it unfolds: and especially when it has been made fine and like a cloth: and I am confident that it will not adhere to its place due to its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	However, if you hope that the skin will adhere and does not follow the last corruption: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh: then treat it with Clister as you consider for the Sea.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large and the pus that comes out of it has a fetid odor: then treat it with Clister as you receive the Egyptian medicine, which is a mixture of vinegar, oil, and zinc, and are received in equal parts, and are boiled over fire until the medicine turns red: and it comes to a thick consistency like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and Clisterize with the Sea: and tie the opening of it, and release the medicine into it for the amount of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with a smile: and do this for several days until the Sea is cleansed and the odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is Clisterized with ashes and water, when the medicine is not present to you: and it is, that when you take the ash of wood or the ash of oak: and throw it over it with water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then eat it, and Clisterize with it, until you are confident that the Sea has washed it.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient is not able to tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ashes and water: then Clisterize it with water and honey, which has already been mixed with some of the ground zinc.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Whenever you wish to dress a wound with pitch and honey, it is proper to mix them together, because of the property of honey to cleanse and to wash: and honey makes wine adhere to the skin, especially when there are superfluities of stinching and drying properties in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this several times, and I am confident that the decay is already removed: then apply pitch and honey to the wound itself, which he causes to produce flesh in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is that you take from the plaster, and dissolve it with olive oil, and warm wine: or apply pitch to the wound with some medicines and ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the wound is narrow, in which the cannula of the clister does not fit: then enlarge it with iron, or place in it an intact lock of hair in Egyptian ointment, or in basilic ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if it is also wide, then gather the lips of the wound with the suture: and let out of it the amount that enters the clister without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the opening of it from which pus runs is elevated to the upper parts: then dry it in a lower place within itself, so that the pus may run down from it into the lower part: for when the pus is contracted in depth, it prevents the production of flesh in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to dry the wound below it according to your wish: then try, as if you were preparing the member in preparation for the pus to run down from it according to how it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try not to hold anything of the pus entirely within it: and take the solidified remedies which are placed above the sign, agreeable to what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	Extend it over a layer of linen.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	The linen should be of such a size that it allows for the entire wound to be covered.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then make an incision with sutures along the direct opening of the sinus, almost up to the sinus opening.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then apply a gentle ointment over the linen, according to the size of the opening: and place it above the position, far from the sinus opening, so that the pus would come out from there: and you will not remove the large linen piece unless after some days one.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	However, the one who is above the sinus opening is the one that you remove at all times, so as to come out what is gathered in it from the pus: and so you will know if that which runs out of it is much or little: or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you again consider the place of the sinus of that one, whether the lord of it feels pain there, or not, or if there is pain there, or not, and if there is not an aposteme.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When you extend your treatment in this way, and see what comes out from the sinus opening, then you know that the sinus is stuck, or is approaching stickiness: then you will loosen it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you loosen it, then change the linen piece, and apply the ointment again.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	However, if it comes out from the sinus after a long distance, then do not despair of its sticking, because the healing of it is approaching, for there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act against it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	However, if it comes out from the sinus after many days of indigested pus, then you will know that the sinus does not stick.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If then the adhesion of the sinus is slow and prolonged, and then add to the drying of the physicians, let them be such that they are moist in their substance and dry in their virtue, as ointment dyafinicon, when superfluities of addition are added to it from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the latter part of which it is treated, take ointment dyafinicon and dissolve it with pink oil, and pour it over the old wine equal in substance to it.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then close it up with this and use it yourself.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does a similar action when there is no ointment dyafinicon near you, honey, when you extract it, until it thickens, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, frankincense, and olibanum, and bruise them all together, and while it is over the fire, make it smooth on the honey.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then lay a linen cloth over it, and bind it tightly over the sinus: and when you have extracted the honey that has been boiled until it thickens, and made it smooth on the honey, and place the linen cloth over it and bind it tightly.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when the long aristolochia is given in that, and the celestial lily roots, and the lily: and the herb flour, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them either simple or mixed, and bruise them, and make the cribella itself: and make it smooth on the honey that I will tell you to use, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the sinus is prolonged and not cured by this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depth: or already makes an impression on the bones, or in other hard members, or in the ligaments: then treat it according to the treatment of fistulas as I have previously mentioned.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	The treatment of Panaritis and the wearing down of the nail, together with the addition of a cut to the digit and a section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 11.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritis is a blister that is born under the nail of the hand or foot, and perhaps it is born in other digits.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When this affliction is prolonged and neglected, and the blister becomes hot: or it corrupts, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption spreads to the bone, until it has an offensive odor: and the tip of the digit becomes swollen, and its color becomes black.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you are treating it, when you have done what we said in the section about division, and the treatment does not agree with it: then it is necessary to cut with iron all the remaining excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Cauterization is a remedy for ulcers.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the additions of the nail are already compressing the flesh towards the interior, and beginning to prick it, and hurt it: then it is necessary to put on a thin layer of plum under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and press it upwards: and cut it with ease, and place on top of what remains of the flesh from medicines that are burning and corrupting, until the whole of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If the corruption has already pricked the bone: then it is necessary to cut the bone, and take it out: for it is never healed while the corrupted bone remains in the place.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption about to enter the finger, then cut it off at one of its nodes, according to what has been remembered about it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it itself, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	However, if there is an erosion or a blow to the nail, and pain arises in it, then it is necessary to first make an incision in the weakest part.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then scrape off the nail with a sharp salt section, from above towards the mouth.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard against it being cut into the flesh beneath the nail, for you are causing this by the weakest pain, and it will be a cause for adding tissue to the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then take care of the place with that which soothes the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	However, the finger that is added to some human hands may be entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them are born from the root of the joint, or it is a birth of its kind in some nodes of the fingers.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, that which is born in some nodes of the fingers does not move: and that which is born at the joint of the fingers may move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, of those which are from them, the cutting is easy for the fleshy ones.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That which is, that you cut it off at its own root with a sharp salt on both sides.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, the care of that which has a birth in the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, do not make an incision in it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	However, in that which is born at the end of the fingers, then it is necessary to make an incision in its first flesh round up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then cut the bone with one of the bones of the same kind that is suitable for this.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it itself, until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However, the consolidation that happens to the fingers is often due to the man's nature, that is, born with him, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from combustion of fire, and such things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it must leave that consolidation until the fingers return according to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place a thread or softly infused linen in rose oil: so that they do not quickly consolidate, and separate them: or place a thin platinum sheet between them, until the place consolidates according to what is appropriate.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if a consolidation happens to some fingers with the palm, then cut that consolidation according to what is prepared and becomes the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	¶ Of the incision.
Caput XCII.	Head 12.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	The veins are wrapped up, thick, full of superfluous melancholic swellings that happen in many parts of the body: and the most frequent of them is in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk and labor, and carry.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it must apply a massage to the body from black bile with a strong exhaustion.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then make a phlebitomy on the patient's basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of these is according to two methods with iron.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	They are uncouth, so they will be cut, and black blood is drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is to make the vein hollow and draw out all of it.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of this is according to this mode.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Scrub the crus with hot water first, until the coarse, feces-like blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tie the weak crus from its superior part of the thigh, down to the inferior part of the knee with thread.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then draw out, that is, extract blood in your hand from the lower part of the thigh, up to the top, and the weak one must be drawn out first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut off the nail until it goes out of the amount of blood you see is sufficient, and that the weak one can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie it: and tell him to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and do not harm the weak one.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, this is the way of his leeching.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the weak crus if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce it into the bath: or rub it on the thigh of the crus with hot water, until it reddens and the veins swell, or exercise it strongly if there is no bath nearby, until the member becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut off the skin in a direct vena section along its length, or at the end of it at the knee, or at the lower part of it at the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hairs, and scrub the vein from all parts until it becomes visible to the touch: and it is at the appearance of this, which you see red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it comes out of the skin, you will see it white as a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert the radium under it, until when it is fully expanded and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a cat's eye, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another section near that section of three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrub the skin from the upper part of the wound, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then expand it with the radium as you have done, and suspend it with another cat's eye, as you have done at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another section, or more sections, if you need those.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then expand it, and cut the last section at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until it comes out from the section above it, or from all higher sections, until it entirely emerges: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you to extract and expand: then insert a needle with strong thread twice, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert the radium under it: and roll your hand over all parts until it emerges.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful that it does not cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it cuts, it becomes difficult for you to expand it gently, and it emerges above the weakest part of it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have completely extracted it: then place a piece of damp lint under the wound, submerged in wine and rose oil, or rose oil: and care for it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, having a winding which it is to be folded to the parts, and not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary to cover over on it to all parts of its winding, and the place of involution of its own.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with threads, until it expands completely: and be careful not to cut the wound or the scars at your own section above it, for it will be difficult for you to expand or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Take heed of your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of the incident on which grapes are cured.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of the blind man.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	The form of the blind man is not like the others, nor is it sharp at the extremities, so it will not wound the eye: and it is heavy with folds, soft: for if it were subtle, it would catch the eye with its subtility: moreover, it is superfluous in its heaviness, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Of the extraction of the thigh vein.
Caput XCIII.	Head 13.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the thighs in hot terrestrial lands, such as Algiers, and in the Arab lands, and in hot, dry lands, few arid lands, that is, in which there is no growth of herbs or trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	Indeed, its generation is from putrefaction which happens under the skin, just as happens inside the bodies of snakes and ascaris worms, and the worms that are generated between the skin and the flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the onset of this vein is that which happens in the thigh inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then it becomes a wound.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to issue from the place of that wound, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore you see the extremity of that vein, then it is necessary to suspend a lead weight on the same fragment of lead, whose weight is from one drachm to two drachms and a half, and release the suspended lead from the thigh.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	When therefore something issues from that vein towards the outside, suspend it in the lead, and release the lead with the node.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged for a long time, then cut out a part of it and bandage the remaining part.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it deeply before it has completely grown out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and goes into the flesh: it causes an abscess, putridity in its place, and a bad wound.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to handle it carefully and remove it gradually until it comes out completely from the end of its own body, and there should be nothing left in the body: and from this very vein, which is in some men five fingerbreadths long and ten, it comes out into certain people.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has already yielded to me because it expelled a man from twenty fingers.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it is cut on your day of medication: then insert the root into its opening, and make a long hole through the body with it, until all that is in it from the matter is expelled: and administer putridity to the place with medicines for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care of the abscess itself by the cure of the abscess.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this very vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and it comes out from all the openings of the branch.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore take care of it as I said in the division, and with what has been said before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	¶ About the cutting of the worms generated under the skin, and it is called bunion.
Caput XCIIII.	Caput XCIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This affliction is called in our land the Aegritudo bouina: because it happens often to the bougs, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	When it moves throughout the whole body, ascending and descending: and is shown to the sense during walking, from one member to another, until it reaches wherever it may tear, and then it goes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from putrefaction of some humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	So do vermin and snakes, that is, slugs, and worms, in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it fears from its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when it itself moves through the body, and ascends to the head, and goes around to the place: then perhaps it opens in it, and goes out, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure it, and to take it out, then this is not done except during walking, and by the sense of its own being.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to tie what is above it, and what is under it with a strong constriction bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and take it out from above.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it pierces into the flesh, and you do not find it: then place over the place a cauterization with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater than what you fear, is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see it already ascended to the head near the eye: then tie under it a good tightened brow bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and take it out from above.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that he use a weak cleansing of his body, when the physicians are curing putrefying humors with bad drugs.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of food generating putrefaction for himself.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	¶ About the cutting on the sickness of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Head XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called Nakir in our land: it is a pain that occurs in some parts of the body, and then shifts from one part to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have already seen it, according to what I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I am called to a weak woman in some cases of labor.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she pushes out her arm, and I see a slight swelling in the new flesh of her arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour has passed, I see one swelling to rise with the flesh, as the embryo rises to the shoulder, ascending to a higher place than it can be: so that it is like silver when it runs from one place to another.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore, the pain departed from that place and fixed itself in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and she ran to the rest of her body until it became saturated in the arm with something else.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that she was rolling over in her whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore, I was amazed at the swiftness of its shifting from one part to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself had not seen this disease in that way before.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	Nevertheless, I have seen many who found the pain to shift from one part to another: and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is so, unless it is because the woman was of those who are detected by the dry parts of the body for their wetness: therefore, it appears to the senses that the vapor has shifted.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and in the bodies of the moist, of the hidden vapors.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you wish to treat it and the patient feels the pain of it: then, if the eye is visible to you, as we said, then draw a line above it, and quickly below it: and dry the area around it, until the entangled vapor escapes: and cauterize the spot.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with the movement of the body, and with that which expels the vapors, and causes them to be carinated with rancid pills, and pills of serapine, and such like.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	¶ About the Extraction of the Arrow.
Caput XCVI.	Head 46.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are diversified according to their kinds and the places where they strike from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is that: for among them there are some which have large points, and small ones: and sharp-pointed, and rough-pointed.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them there are some which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them there are some which have a tongue.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them there are some which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those which are according to the parts where they strike, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or if the parts be from the principal members, as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lungs, and kidneys, and intestines, and uterus, and such like.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When then the arrow strikes into one of these parts, and you see signs of death which I will tell you later, it is necessary to make an extraction of that arrow from thence, for death follows it in many ways.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when you do not see those signs of evil, and the arrow is not hidden deep in the member, then take it out, and heal the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	When an arrow falls on the brain, and pierces the mouth, and exits through the eye, it is because such a wound causes soda to flow, dizziness, vertigo, redness in the eyes, swelling of the tongue, spasm of the muscles, mixture of intellect, and vomiting of choler.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood may flow from the ears, or out of the nostrils.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And white fluid may flow from the wound site.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And similar water-like flesh exits from there.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If these signs seem to you, then stop the treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not exit.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the arrow when it falls on the heart are: that it is near the left breast: and it feels as if it is fixed in hard things, not in soft things.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a similar motion to that of the pulse: and it runs from the elbow black blood.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And it follows this cold at the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Therefore, you know that death has descended far from doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the exit of foaming blood from the elbow: and the wound that follows the neck, becomes red, and the weak color changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And the great breath is expelled high: and it seeks the cold air's attraction.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	And if the arrow falls on the vein, which is in the breast: then it is near the costal muscles: and there is a great thirst with painful dullness, with sighing: and all the humeral muscles move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	If an arrow falls into the stomach, perhaps it will then exit through the thigh, carrying with it something undigested from the food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	If an arrow falls into the belly, and sticks in it, something of the kind of dung comes out through the thigh, or a piece of excrement, or a part of the intestine that is already torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope in the treatment of this, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow falls into the bladder and exits with urine, and something comes out from it to the outside, and the pain is greater on the weakest part: then you know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining parts, such as the face, neck, throat, larynx, trapezius, shoulder blades, hip, leg, and foot, are healed according to several dispositions: when the arrow does not hit an artery or a nerve, and it is not a poisoned arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I have seen the nature of these arrows, so that you understand through this about your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore, I drew it out from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was cured, and there was no harm to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	I also drew out another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye below the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I only caught hold of its end with the tip of my finger, when it adhered to the wood of his bow: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew is therefore cured, and there is no harmful accident to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the mouth of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabian arrow, and those are its ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I therefore held it above the same two girdles: and it had already been swallowed by his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was thus diligent with them, until I extracted it: and the Christian is cured.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man who had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his circumstances, I held it above the arrow: and I touched it, and extracted it: and he is cured, and there is no harmful accident to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man who had fallen into his back, and the rib was healed over on it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years, the arrow was extracted from the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman who had fallen into her belly with the arrow, and the rib was healed over on it, and the arrow remained inside of it, and nothing had changed in her circumstances, and the woman did not find any harm from any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man who had fallen into his face with the arrow, and the rib was healed over on it, and it remained, not finding him much pain, and such like many things.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's principals, who had fallen into his middle of his nose, and it had already leaned towards the right side: and the arrow was hidden completely.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I am called to care for him after the arrow wound, up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I then cut the pointed arrow tightly with a knife.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I then questioned it with gentle trials, and did not find it: and he himself found the point and the pain under his own gold on his right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I then hoped that it was the point of the arrow from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I then applied the plaster to the place with the plaster where the virtue attracted and digested, confident among me that it would be the spot where the arrow would be hit, and a sign of the arrow would appear to me so that I could cut on it: but it did not happen in the place meaning that the arrow had reached the spot.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I then applied the plaster to it day after day: and nothing happened, and the wound was consolidated in the meantime: but it remained weak for the extraction of that space of days, until he felt the arrow in his own nose one day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I then applied sharp medicine to it for many days until it was open: and when I tried to try it, and felt the point of the thin arrow that adhered to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the point of the arrow was visible to us: and it passed by me within about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then when the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not obey the exit: I did not stop to refine, and to invent ways with the hands, until I once extracted it on a day with forceps made according to their form, according to which they want the end of the fingers, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I will restore the flap.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed, the physician says that the nasal cartilage cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restore it myself, and the flap is consolidated, and the patient is cured of his weakness in good health, without causing him any harm at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of the extraction of several arrows: so place that rule and meaning over what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts and distinctions of this art are not comprehended with narration: nor does that book comprehend it, and the wise artificer compares a little with much: and when he sees what is present, he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descending things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, that arrows do not issue from the limbs in which they are fixed, unless by two methods.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite side of another part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And those which issue from where it entered, are an arrow proceeding into the flesh, and is attracted and issues forth.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	And if it does not submit to the exit from the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary to release it for a few days, until the putrefying flesh around it releases its attraction and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is formed in the bone, and does not submit to your exit: then release it for a few days: and then try it again with its attraction and motion every day until it issues forth.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	And if it does not submit to your exit after a day: then it is necessary to open the bone around the arrow in the same bone from all sides with a fine chisel, until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then pull it out and extract the same one.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	However, if the arrow is fixed in the skull bone and has already passed into one of the brain lobes, and it appears that some of the aforementioned symptoms are present: then stop pulling on the arrow and release it, until it is equal in size the next day.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow pierces the skull, then death will not be prolonged to him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed only in the bones, but does not penetrate up to the skull, and remains weak for a few days, and no such symptoms occur from them: then the intelligence in the removal of the arrow and its extraction.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	However, if the arrow is fixed firmly and does not obey your pull: then apply a blister around the arrow, as I will describe to you: then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	However, if the arrow is already hidden in the body, and hidden and concealed from sensation: then search for it with caution.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	However, if you feel it: then pull it out with some instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	However, if you cannot reach it due to the constriction of the wound, and due to the length of the arrow in the deep part: and there is no bone, nerve, or vein above it: then find something above it until the wound is amplified and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If the ears to which it is tied are present: then free the flesh that is fixed in them from all sides, by any means you can think of, and intelligence, if not possible through the fracture of the ear and its twist, until it comes loose.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, in whatever part it is, then use a twist of your hand with the needles to all parts, until you make it come loose: and with a subtle final subtlety, so that the arrow does not break, and it be difficult for you to attract its attraction and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot operate on it at once, delay the operation for a few days until the putrid matter around it has putrefied.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat the operation: for if it makes a contrary current of blood, then administer what I said in the chapter on treatment: and preserve your health from wounds, or nerves, or strings.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And apply all methods of archery you can think of for release: and let it be with ease, calmness, slowness, or firmness, as I have described to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it must be that when you draw the arrow, it is weak according to its figure, as was at the case of the arrow in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more difficult.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If, however, you cannot do that, then apply what is possible to you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow that is going out from the opposite side of another part, or already going out from it something to the outside: or it makes a bulging at the end of the arrow through the sense of the skin of the nearest part, and you see it prominent: then cut over it, and let the section be according to the amount that is caught in the screws.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it back: for it itself makes it easy to go out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow prints itself in the bone, and enlarges itself: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: delay the operation for a few days, then repeat it until it goes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however the wood of the arrow has fallen, and you wish to give it impulse: then insert with an instrument a concave one, so that its concavity reaches the end of the arrow: then push it with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If, however, the wound is closed, then push it with the instrument as it is being inserted into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	Indeed, the wound is closed by this.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If, however, the wound is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut out the entire flesh in which the pox is, if that is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with that which comes to that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If, however, the wound is falling into the chest, or in the belly, or in the side, or on the back: and it is near to that which you touch with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut it, and be careful not to cut into the pox, or a nerve, and take it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then if you see your gouernor, and take care of that, until it be healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the Forciptum, by which they take out the wound.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The extremities should be like a face, with teeth, which are made like iron: when they take hold of the wound above the Sagita, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And they are many kinds of them, great and small, and medium, according to the magnitude of the wound, and the thinness of the wound, and the breadth of the wound, and the constriction of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of the pusher is a conga.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the pusher is deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the deaf end like a radius, so that the introduction of its enter may be closed with the Sagita, and it is pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The end of the pusher's conga is a conga like a beak: so that the introduction of the Sagita into it and its push may be closed.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	¶ About Bloodletting of Veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter XCVII.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	There are thirty types of venepuncture, which is a customary practice in the body.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	There are sixteen types of veins in the head: two pulsating veins called the Azymes, and two arteries that appear in two temples: two veins in the two lacrimal bags of the two eyes, known as the Aspicientes: a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead: and a vein in the extremity of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Guidegi veins in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins in the lower lip of the mouth.

Two of the veins that are under the phlebitic swelling are: that the cephalic vein is for the preforation which are in the throat, and the weakness of the eye, and the weaknesses of the mouth.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	¶ Of the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	However, the three veins that are phlebitic in the elbow, are those that have become customary in all men's phlebotomy.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by pressing with the myrtle phlebotomy wide: or by olive oil to the subtlety of it: or by drying with the phlebotomy of the cultivator, and it is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is, which is convenient for the section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these are the flat and the subtle ones, and the largeness of the veins and their strictness of the form of the myrtle phlebotomy is flat, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is convenient for the opening of the eyelids, the full ones, the proceeding, the apparent, the heavy, and those which contain the thick blood, the turbid.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	This small vein is of less width and more delicate at its extremity.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	It can be applied to the veins of the subtle golden blood that is contained in them.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Regarding the phlebitis of the Basilican vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	However, the Basilican vein among the three veins of blood is the one that needs to be opened.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and neck, from which it follows the chest, and the vein: and it can be opened by the surgeon with the phlebotomy tool on it, so as not to cause fear from it, for there is an artery under it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If then he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will incise that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, it is necessary for the surgeon not to open the vein with a sharp phlebotomy tool, but rather to be gentle with it, and to be careful with Alne's silk.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the Basilican appearance does not seem clear, then it is necessary to remove it and change it to another, or ask someone about its branch: or use the phlebotomy site as the fun of the thigh.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is clear and you should dry it with Alne's silk, as I have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If however you want to open the vein of the same one, then it is necessary before tightening the thigh, to touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then make signs on the place with the encaustic, then the thigh, and dry the vein section with Alne's silk, as I have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful not to fall the impact through the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	When you see, when you tie the bandage, the inflammation in the place that you marked with the burn, then that inflammation is an arterial inflammation: therefore it is extinguished.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood flowing at a vein-cutting, like the urine of a child, and it is a thin, red blood: then you know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then accordingly, and place your thumb over the space for a long time, then take back your thumb.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then tie the arm, and let it go: and let the weak one be afraid of its motion: and let it be above his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And it will not move it for days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If the blood is not cut off, and does not stop you: and there is no one present in your moment of medicine, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its ends contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of leather, and find it: take a half of it, and tie it over the place of the vagina's tightening, with the bandage and the pulleys until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of it with the one whose remembrance precedes the flow of blood from the child's wound: and the cutting of his blood is not difficult in many positions, because of the small wound and the possibility of the bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	¶ About the venous hemorrhage of Fuscus.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	However, the venous hemorrhage of Fuscus is the juice, which draws blood from the superior part of the head, and the inferior part of the body: for it is composed of the Basilic branch, and the Cephalic branch, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	The bloodletting surgeon finds it suitable for this purpose, as there is a nerve under it, so that it should be done with caution due to the risk of damaging the nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	Therefore, if he adds to the puncture of bloodletting and finds a nerve, there may be unconsciousness, and it becomes difficult to cure him, and perhaps he will not recover completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and not shown: then you should perform your bloodletting on it, with a section like Alnesil, and cut the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If there is a vein between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Regarding the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	However, the bloodletting of the cephalic vein is a stimulant, because it attracts blood from the head and leads to eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is appropriate in this vein, if you wish, to bloodlet it by puncturing it with an olive-oil phlebotomy needle, or with a myrtle-oil phlebotomy needle: because it is the easiest vein of all, because there is no subcutaneous artery, and no nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it suits you during bloodletting to use a knife with the phlebotomy needle, and to seek a gentler place: and it will not harm it if it is not found by first percussion, so that it may return above it with repeated bloodletting.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, it may cry out in some people when not bloodletted by first percussion, but it will not hurt them that cry.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Regarding the utility of bloodletting and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality and accidents of phlebotomy, and those that occur with its correction, are things you should consider.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, it is necessary to know that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health, and with perseverance in it, and caution against the coming of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And it should be done in one arm of three, which are in the elbow, namely the cephalic, and the black, and the basilican.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And it should be done in the beginning of spring after fasting, in the truth, and in summer: and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And it should be done on the first day, or on the third day, after the three hours have passed since the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, the phlebotomy that is administered in diseases does not have a determined hour: but when convenience and need for it are presented, it can be done at night or day, and in every hour, and in every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it should not be done on children until they are over fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, unless from the fourth month to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should old men be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	But when anyone wishes to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that he cleanses his intestines before the bleeding with a mild clyster, if there is much fecal matter retained in them: so that the veins do not attract the putrid superfluities of the intestines which are noxious to the principal membranes.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient be bled on the eve of the full moon, that is, from satiety, nausea: nor a drunkard, nor one who is drunken, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor is one weak with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let it be caused again by phlebotomy after the passing of a fit of passion, and vomiting, and flux of the humors, and multiplication of coitus, and labor, and exercise, and fasting, and all that dissolves strength from the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if blood is coarse with food and drinks, and medicines: if possible, do this.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him take a bath, if nothing forbids it: or exercise in some exercise, to make the blood more subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place the phlebotomy of his heart in the breast, around the third day, as we said: and may it be that his breast pounds on that day from all the evil animal occurrences: such as narrowness, and anger, and fear: and from all the body occurrences, such as labor, and pain, and superfluity, and these like.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him seat himself and make these things to be present with which he used to run his course custom of men from aromaticity, and odor, and tribulation, and such like in quantity as possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist seat himself on a higher place than the place of phlebotomy, and then take his arm and rub it with his own hand twice, or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he should tie the ligament with the corrections, and unfold it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And the tie should be temperate, for when it is unequal or through superfluity in the tie, it prevents the course of the blood: or in the mollification, it also prevents the course of the blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the tie, it is necessary that he rub his phlebotomy hand with both hands until the wetness comes and declares to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist will remove blood with a little oil, properly called for.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he will place his thumb on the left hand over the vein where he wants to draw blood, a little: so as not to cause pain, and press down gently.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For the vein is like a fleeing chord at surgery, and it is the one that is full of vitality: and when you place the blood over it, it contracts under the bloodletting, and deceives the bloodletter, and does not open the vein: and if it opens, it is tight: therefore, it is necessary for the bloodletter to be firm and attentive to all things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he will let go of the blood.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then, it opens the vein from the oil alone, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then try this oil elsewhere, or above it with haste: if it does not cause the place to bleed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If it causes the place to bleed, or weakens it, then let him give it one day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligament.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps it will draw the hot burn.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Do not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he will repeat the bloodletting if he likes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If it is small, or runs blood thinly: and be careful not to let too much blood escape: then repeat the bloodletting through the same hole according to its direction, and add a little to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with haste, before the place bleeds, for the bleeding place is in many people at a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see it already bleeding, then do not repeat it completely, for it does not excuse anything in your eyes.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	Place something from the feces oil on top: for it helps in blood circulation.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	This is better in this place than the oil itself, and even better than the rest of the olive oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	Similarly, administer oil to all your phlebotomies wherever you restrict blood circulation: and they will become Tyrian brass, and sagger, when placed on one of them over the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If it happens in the site of a phlebotomy scar, which often happens, especially to those who are not phlebotomized except for the vein, or is an open small wound, then immediately and place on top of the water and salt, slightly heated, a sponge infused with blood, and string it for an hour: because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary to do this after the end of blood from the same vein or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If something black or blue remains in the place after several days, it will not harm you: and if you wish, place something on top of it, such as aloe or myrrh: or something from the juice of mint, that is, calamiter or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	Indeed, many occur at the site of the phlebotomy at the basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore, place your hand on it, then if you find a soft spot under your compression on it, then that eminence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, so that you can place something on top of it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with the one that has stipticity, so that the site becomes hard.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then he should attend to it himself with the rest of the treatment until he is cured.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that all men have the blood of their own strength removed in due proportion.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color of the wine over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it be released to flow until it turns red: and so if you see it thick, then let it be released until it becomes thin: and so if it is sharp, then let it be released until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and requires a single extraction of blood to amplify the phlebotomy vein, and for the phlebotomus to be on the side: and in him who is weak, it should be opposite to that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary for him to draw it out in the veins, and for the foramen to be strict: and it is better that what is given in phlebotomy vein is a transuersa section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy by extension and breadth.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And whom it is customary to fast before phlebotomy syncopis, it is necessary that he eat a little bread soaked in wine before the phlebotomy: or if it is cold, let it be heated: and let him release it from the blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the complexion is frozen, then let him take before the phlebotomy a bread soaked in wine infusion, or in a syrup made from honey with spices, or in an aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If a syncopal episode occurs during phlebotomy and the cause of its blood exit is many, then it is necessary to take a hand of fresh flesh, a subtle odorous syrup, and use aromaticity with algae, and line the chest with this, and use the remaining ones that I mentioned in the division in the chapter of syncope from emesis.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	If someone wishes to achieve the release of his arm and the solution of his blood secondly, it is necessary for him whose phlebitis is due to emesis and his strength is weak, so that he releases blood gradually according to the amount of his strength over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	If however he wishes to achieve the release of his arm and the solution of his blood secondly, and his body is strong, then he should do this after seven hours or a new from his first phlebitis.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	If however he wishes to attract his blood from his body to the opposite part on which it leans, it is necessary for him to achieve release in the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	If however in his body there is already much heated blood, and sharpens, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary for him to withdraw much blood from the vein in one vinegar, and extract a large quantity from it: and extend the opening until a syncope occurs: after which you will preserve all conditions of phlebotomy: and how you will place your hand on the pulse of his course of blood, so that a death does not occur at the place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and falls into negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you wish to release the arm and release the blood secondly, when the orifice of the vein is already closed, and there is a difficult exit of blood, so that it be done with great force and the vein is extended quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	This is indeed an unpleasant wound, yet let it be released until the phlebotomist treats it a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	If you remove it with the sharpness of the phlebotomist when that which has been coagulated by blood from the opening of the vein is removed, and place something salted in water over it, it will be healed.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place something from Tyrian tar over it, or pitch, and place a gentle compression on it until blood is drawn out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the vein has become hardened, let it be released and do not press it until it settles.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If something necessitates the second removal of blood and there is no excuse, then either the phlebotomy itself over that place or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	However, the band of the arm is phlebotomized at the place of the Fuscus and Basilicus veins, when they are not found, and they are hidden, because it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of that phlebotomy is such that she inserts her weak hand into hot water until it reddens and the vein is clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then she will gently compress over it with a medium degree of constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the second phlebotomy is made gradually, not laterally, nor according to length: and it should be widely open, and your phlebotomy that you have made over the joint of the hand almost.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the exit of the blood is forbidden, then she will repeat the hand in hot water, and let the blood run into water until she satisfies her need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	However, if you are in the days of summer, then you will excuse yourself from repeating the hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	The course of blood is particularly noted to flow in hot water at the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	The bloodletting of this kind is softer than in all other veins, because it is not subject to pressure, nor is the nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The bloodletting of the right hand of the salutary art is beneficial for the pains of the back.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	The quality of the bloodletting is such that you will tighten the big toe of your hand with the bandage, or with your own hand, after you have introduced it into hot water, until the vein becomes full, and it will be felt by the senses.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then the bloodletting is transferred through the transfusion.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you apply it entirely, it will not harm that to any part of it.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And keep it, so as not to end with your hand when bloodletting.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For there are bare nerves of the fingers under it.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat your hand to hot water, and let the blood run through it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat it in hot water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and it will be forbidden to run.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you withdraw the necessary quantity of blood from the blood, then put oil and salt on top of the vein, so that it does not stick together hastily.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And it is also necessary to do this when you tighten all the branches.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The juice of this bloodletting is: for it is beneficial for the pains of the spleen: and do the same in the bloodletting as you did in the second equal.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The juice of the saphenous bloodletting is for the pains that are in the lower part of the body, such as the pain of the womb, and retention of menstruation, and weakness of the liver, and old ulcers and sores of the thighs and knees, and such like from these diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	The quality of the phlebotomy procedure is such that it inserts the weakened foot of its own into hot water: and makes over it friction, until the waters become bloody: and ties above the joint of the foot with the correction.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	Indeed, the place of the blood is at the heel, appearing reversed thumb: and many branches of the legs are ramified from it on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, the phlebotomy is done in a wider branch of it, or at the heel in its gathering: for it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If however, phlebotomy is done on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves which are under it on the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy in such a way that it is done from the transuded blood, as if you were going to incite it: and let the phlebotomy be of Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	However, if the exit of the blood is forbidden, then you should insert the foot of its own into hot water: and let the blood run into it, until it becomes clear.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If however, the phlebotomist errs in the first drop of blood, then he will go with the phlebotomy to the higher parts, for it is safe and you do not fear any harm from it when you cause nerves as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly when the Saphena of the other foot is equal to it.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	However, the location of the Sciatic vein as we have said, is at the heel on the side of the leg.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the treatment of its phlebotomy is, to the pain of Anchaea, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that it enters the weakened bath and becomes firm: and he should tie the crus of his weak leg from the side of Anchaea to the heel above four fingers, with a thin long string: for it does not appear except for that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When then you see it, then perform the phlebotomy according to your ability, either by suction or by transfusion: and it is better, or to cut it by incision, or to cut it by section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is more profitable, and it itself is hidden in the private parts of many men.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all: then perform a phlebotomy on some branch of it, and that is the one that appears in the sole of the foot, and the ear-like one: and be careful of the nerves, and make the blood flow according to the quantity you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then dissolve the stricture, and place the corium over the site of the phlebitis, and tie the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it cures quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	¶ About the use of Ventilation and its quality.
Caput XCVIII.	Head 48.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventiles are made from the corners, and from air, and from earth.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And ventilation indeed happens in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When with scarification, and the extraction of blood: and another is ventilation without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventilation which is without scarification, is in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Either it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the ventilations which are given with scarification and the extraction of blood, are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is Ventosation Alnocrati, and is the last of the head: and Alkehel, and is in the neck: and Ventosations Alhagdahim, and are two layers of the collar from two parts at once: and Ventosations of the mentum, and is under the mandible in the lower jaw: and Ventosations of two spatulas: and Ventosations of Alachosos on the end of the tail: and Ventosations of two focils, and are in the middle of two brachii: and Ventosations of two cuffs: and Ventosations of two cuanillae.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And Ventosation indeed does not draw blood from you of the finest particles scattered in the flesh, and for that reason it does not fail strength from them, just as is the case with its effect from phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not necessary to administer ventosation either with fire, or without fire, in certain diseases that arise from repletion, until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If the necessity for ventosation is provoked by the disease, or from custom, we administer it at all times at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and whenever the time may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is, because of men who when the blood increases in it, until they require an extraction from it by ventosation, find in their head a grauedinem, and a sodahan.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from them are those who find repletion and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from them are those who find pruritus in their face, and on their forehead, and a darkness, and a dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from them are those who experience pain in the place of their own ventosation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from them are those whose laughter is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from them are those who find a taste of blood in their mouth: or they spue out blood, and expel it.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from them are those whose sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from them are those who see in their sleep blood, and redness, and wounds, and similar things to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something of these, and especially if it is in the middle of the third month: we advise that ventosation be made to be performed, after the two hours have passed, or three.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The neck of the windpipe, is because it carries the old age to the head, and that which is poured out to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	It should be, that this should be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And indeed, this is in the place of the cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it should not be used by one who has a cold complexion, or in which there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it does not bring large harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And therefore, it should not be used by the old, and in whose head there are cold diseases.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But if he is persistent on it, a forgetfulness is generated for him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore, it should be that you precede the windpipe surgeon, so that he lowers his hand when it is almost wet to the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosation or Alkehel is in the place of the cephalic phlebotomy and the basilic phlebotomy, and for that reason it brings asmati, constriction, anhelitus, instrumental fissure anhelitus, tussis, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it should be that Alkehel ventosation is pressed upwards, because if it is laid down lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Alhagdahim ventosation brings painful accidents in the head, obtalmia, hemiglossal, perforations, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in the place of the basilic phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it should be that you precede the windpipe surgeon, so that he does not lower his hand when shaving: so as not to rupture the artery, and to cause the flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventilation under the chin, wine is poured into the mouth, and corruption of the tongue, and similar to these from diseases that are in the mouth: and it is in place of phlebotomy, which are in two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Ventilation of the spatula, it is poured on the wine, which is made by reflection, and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Ventilation of the interior parts of the two spatulas, it is poured on the three veins of the thighs, basilic, and fuscus, and cephalic: for it draws blood from all these small veins that are in the flesh: and these small veins are drawn from other large veins until the attraction becomes attached to the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you be the first to ventilate, so that the process does not proceed too much in the scarification: for the place is bare of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	Ventilation however that becomes saturated on the wine, pours over the anus, and over the lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you be the first to ventilate so that it is large and comes from the air: for the place needs strong suction, and perhaps the small vents are broken, and the scarification is large.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Ventilation however reduces the bed diminutively: for it draws blood from the whole body, and conveys old pains to the renals, and matriculas, and uesica: it provokes menstruation, and conveys bothor and ademenul: and stand in the place of phlebotomy of two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Indeed they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	The proximity of the winds of Ventus is similar to the proximity of the winds of two cups.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the winds of Ventus is, that you place a wet vapor first, and then a gentle suction: and do not prolong the position of the winds, but place them lightly, and remove them lightly, so that the humors may come to the place in equal measure: and do not cease to repeat this until you see the place already reddened and inflamed, and the redness of the blood appears: then shave it, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For whoever is of soft flesh and rare bones, it is necessary that you shave it only once, not more: so as not to ulcerate the place.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And advise the Ventosator to enlarge the shaving, and make it deep, and temper the suction in ease, and lightness, and motion of its own.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that you shave it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In water indeed the first opening is made for the subtilization of the blood and its aqueousness: and in the second, the pursuit of the sharp extraction of the thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is fecal and valley, then let the shaving of water be the third: so as to get the last.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And at last, when we want to draw the blood slightly, or rather, almost, a single shaving is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If indeed we want the extraction of the blood to be many, we shave it by multiple shavings.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be shaved by deep shaving: and the terminal equal in the shaving, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which must be administered from oils at the position of the Winds, and what must be avoided in inhaling.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In the one where the skin is rough, hard, dark, and the pores of whose skin are narrow, it must be made to anoint the winds with oils that are open, soft, and dissolved, such as the oil of alkali, or the ointment of violets, or the ointment of the seeds of sweet almonds, or the ointment of the cucumber seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the winter season, then the oil of narcissus, or the oil of lilies, or the oil of camomile, or saffron, and similar oils.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If there is superfluousness that is rough and cold, then the oil should be amaracin, or the oil of balsam, or the white oil, or the oil of anetum: and similar oils.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If inhaling is necessary through large pores of soft flesh, it must be prohibited from oil, and it must be made to wash the winds of those places with water that is rosy, or cold, or cold, or water of cucumbers, or water of celery: and similar oils.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of many moistures, washes the winds with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and sumach: and similar oils.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whose superfluities are rough, he washes his own winds with old wine, or with cold water, or with the decoction of anetum, or with camomile: and similar oils.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it must be avoided that in the bath or in the bathroom, but it is necessary that after leaving the bath, either for an hour, or for two hours, it is administered.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	It is not necessary for someone to sleep after ventilation.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is to be done in order to ventilate, or before phlebotomy?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And then it is necessary, if the ventilation or phlebotomy is choleric, and there is sharpness and inflammation above the blood of the patient: then it is necessary that he receive cold, such as pomegranate rind: and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and dry iubeba, and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And then place the meat of his chicks, and lean meats, and cooked foods with coarse flour: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if the complexion is cold, he should take in a pot of syrup made from honey or almonds, or ulecaniabin made from sesame seeds: and he should take a slightly scented wine, which is between old and new: and he should be advised to use it in small amounts.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And then place the meat of his chicks, and cooked foods with hops: and pigeons, that is, young doves: and the young of columbaissadebat.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink of the day and ventilation and phlebotomy be more than the food: and it is necessary that a drink be given in a pot in which some men in Tyrian alfaroch or muscat wine, or alesethe before ventilation: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal limbs are strengthened, and the blood becomes thin.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	It is not necessary for them to take it in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	About ventilation without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, ventilation without scarification are those that are placed on the back, and spleen, and podagram, and above the ventrum, umbilicus, and the region of the liver, and the navel: for these parts do not bear scarification over them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	It is not sought through these, unless there is attachment from a blood vessel to a limb, as we place the vent on the breasts in the case of a bloody discharge from the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we employ them to dissolve the cold moisture injected into a member from another member: as we place the vapor over the ventricle and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	Indeed, it dries the member and heats it up, and relieves the pain because it dissolves that cold moisture.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys when there is poverty or a stone in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	Indeed, the strength of its attachment may open up poverty, or it may remove the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it also does so when placed over the spleen, and the liver to be heated up at the same time in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these vapors are given with the cut only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And they are sometimes given with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And they are sometimes given with full hot water in the cases of pleurisy: and this is, that the vapor is filled with hot water, or with water in which the herbs that agree with it have been decocted.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the vapor given with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	The size of its opening should be two fingers wide, according to the form we have made: and its quantity should be half a palm deep in the hollow: and there should be a small hole in the side, in the place which is about the middle of it, according to the amount that enters the needle: it should be made of air at the same time, or of brass, with golden edges, equal to the size of the hole: so as not to hurt the member in its position over it: and there should be a hole in the middle of it, through which the candle is passed when it is lit with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	This already has been made soft and wet, greater than what we have mentioned, and lesser than that, according to the severity of its ailment and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	Winds are different for children, and those that lessen pain, than those that are for men and large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of applying this wet with fire to the body is, as if you were setting a linen comb with fire from linen, or a small candle from a wick: and place it on the middle of a woman who has passed through menstruation, which is in the lower part of the wet: so that the fire may be set to the lower part of the wet, so that it does not burn the weak body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed on the body: and a finger is placed over the hole which I said, until when we hold the wet: while we require, we remove the finger, and the vapour comes out above that hole, and the wet is immediately dissolved.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then set fire to the linen according to its kind, and then if you need that,
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the wet which is administered in inflammation of pleurisy with water, there is no woman who has passed through menstruation, nor hole: and it is not given unless it is filled with water, and is placed only on the body.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this wet, the more it is great, so that it can hold much water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ About the suspension of Sanguisugarum.
Caput XCIX.	Caput XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Sanguisugae are not given in many, except in which there is no position for the wet, because of their smallness, such as the lip, and gum, and those like them.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a member stripped of flesh, such as the finger, and nose, and those like them.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	The quality of these instruments is such that they are made from blood-letting plants that are found in sweet waters, free from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are allowed to remain in sweet water for a day and night until they become hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body will be emptied at first with bloodletting, and with vomiting.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then cleanse the weak member until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterward, they will be placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled, and fall down, and there is a possibility of drawing out the water from the place with vinegar, then it is the last in the operation: and if not, then cleanse the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then when much water comes out, and it frizzes, and is expressed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood is prolonged after the blood-letting, and it is still residing, then pour linen flax into cold water, and place it on top, until the abscess is separated.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood is multiplied, then poultice it with ground barley or galls, and similar substances from stinx: until the blood is separated.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they may be placed on top of the place in halves of flax seeds: and they are allowed to remain until the flax sticks to the place, because the blood is separated.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if a blood-letting is required again, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if they are forbidden from being hung up, then cleanse the place with the recent blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or hang up a sponge in the places until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are placed on top, because when they feel something from the blood, they stick immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you wish for them to fall, apply something ground or salted or ashed over them, and they will fall immediately.

¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Book III of the Surgical Book by Albucasis.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	Discourse on the restoration, dislocation, and treatment of twists and similar conditions.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of broken bones and accidents of the bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons of mine, that you are stupid doctors and fools who do not understand this chapter of the ancient book, nor have read from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is isolated from our earthly sciences.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never seen any good in this, and I have not obtained it from this, unless I have obtained it only through the long reading of ancient books and a desire for their understanding, until I extracted the science of this from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I applied the experiment and study of the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have described to you all the science of this chapter: and then my experiment surpassed what was contained in that knowledge: and after I had freed it from the occupation of elongation, and from the end of abbreviation, and from the end of declination, and I showed the end of declination: and I formed many forms in it from the shapes of the instruments given in it, when it is from the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections of cases from broken bones, from those whose release is necessary before we begin the recall of the fractured members, and divers, if any.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the preface of this chapter, that it contains the highest sermons, and the headings, to which the understanding of the artificer is directed first, namely, whether you or those who are quick, know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say that when it happens to anyone a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or case: then it is necessary that we immediately attend to the sanguination and the dissolution of it, and also of the latter: if nothing prevents it, as weakness of vigor: or it is he who has something from them, a child, or an old man decayed: or it is time of excessive heat, or excessive cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his food, cold vegetables, and flesh of animals, and seeds: and forbid wine, and fat meat, and repel from the food and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Then when you are secure from the heat of the aposteme, and do not fear the effusion of the material to the member: then the weak one returns to the regimen of the first with whom it was customary for his habit.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the weak one be fed with nutritious food, much and coarse, in which there is weakness: such as food made from boiled flour with water, and rice, and barley, and feet, and intestines of vinegar, and egg, and fresh fish, and wine, and such like.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	When this regimen is made for the coagulation of the fracture more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	When broken bones are in the eyes of those who are in the first stage of old age and decay, it is not possible for them to continue and to heal according to their nature, due to the dryness of their limbs: and they consolidate and continue those which come from them in the end, as the bones of young boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Nevertheless, nature connects something similar to glue on the broken bone from all sides, where there is thickening, which holds and strengthens it until they are glued together, and they bind themselves together until the end of strength and firmness, as was in the beginning, until it does not prevent anything from its operations: and for this reason it is necessary to give weak foods, in which there is thickness, viscosity, and thickening, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	You know that the appearance of fractures is diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs: for the fracture of the thigh is different from the fracture of the bone of the head: and the fracture of the bone of the breast is different from the fracture of the bone of the back: and all other parts of the body are also diverse in their nature: and I come with remembrance of all kinds of fractures, each one distinct from the other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the appearance of the fracture of bones is also diverse within itself.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For it happens that the fracture of this arc is made, except for the stars that happen to it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes it happens that the fracture of this arc is made according to the length of the bone: and these fractures are called saturation points, that is, stars, and the additions that follow, as they do in a quill when the pen is used for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and is a fracture with the ulna and disruption at the head: and is a fracture of the small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And of all kinds is genius, or the proper instrument for its restoration, according to which rememberance of it is to be recollected, distinct in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that by which the fracture of bones is known, is the tortuosity of it, and its eminence: and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you comprise it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is not apparent tortuosity in the place, nor sound when you touch the bone with your hand when you move it, nor great weakness of a large pain: then there is not fracture there, but it is possible that there is tortuosity or a small fissure: therefore it is not necessary to move it with your hand and completely with compression, much less to put above it from medicines, which comes to memory, after the moment that conuenit loco: then it is drawn tight by a subtle string.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you know that the place when it is arched, and is divided into two, besides what happens to satiety, yet all parts are removed from their comparison: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to the rectification of it, equaling it before it happens to him a hot apostema.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however a hot apostema happens to it, then let it be given days, until the apostema rests.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equal it according to whatever mode can be from lenity and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you know that the restoration of it, and its equalization, is easier than bones, in which satiety happens.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then draw it tight according to what comes to memory to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If indeed the bones are affected by caries, then it is necessary to extend this member, broken into two parts, either the hand or foot: or if your hand, then if the member is small: or if with two thongs, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position when you place the member on a corresponding place according to its natural figure, until the parts of the broken member are extended: then try to make those additions with all ingenuity, and according to whatever method you can in those places: and be careful not to cause any pain or injury to the weak part by your operation, nor any wound: and try to apply one of the two bones alongside its companion bone, according to the better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	It is necessary at that time to test and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If then you see something different here, correct it yourself, and make it equal according to the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be careful of a violent extension, and a strong compression, as some foolish men do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often make their own hot aphorism or contraction in the member through that operation, as we have already seen this from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then annex after the equation, and a fitting operation, and a strictly closed member, and quietness, and tranquility: and warn the weak about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it hesitate, lest it move in the hour of its vigilance, and in its dreams at its revolution, and its agitation, and at its evacuation, and all its movements with the last strength of itself.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And so that it may not be in the position of the member with the position that follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when it feels pain or injury in the position of the member's disposition, then it should change it to another position from that with which it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	When setting that bone, make its position equal and straight, so as not to cause twisting in the member when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture of the member is according to what I say.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that fractured members are diversified according to their soundness, and their magnitude, and their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Those which are small like the arm, the finger, and the toe, and such like, then it is fitting that a soft and fine cloth bandage be used.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But if they are large, such as the thigh and the leg, it is fitting that there be a wide bandage in them, hard.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	For a wide bandage connects the large member, and tightens it from all sides equal, so that it does not enter the mark.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then after your purge, begin to put on a suitable liniment to this, in a soft cloth over the place of the fracture of that member.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to bandage the member with three or four folds, according to what is fitting for the member: and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go up with it to the upper part of the place of the fracture, and tighten less than was your stretch, which you bound at the place of the fracture.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch you with the bandage a little, and soften the tight one gradually, until you catch from the healthy place a great thing.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another one carefully, and bandage it again over the place of the fracture with folds.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then go down with the bandage after the fold.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And may your operation be in the bandaging and softening of the fold, according to what I said in the first bandaging above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the incisions made from the plaster or cloth, as is used for the same degree of twisting in the fracture, if there is a twist in it; and if not, do not put anything into it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then place another incision on the same spot.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards, place needles at the same spots immediately, if there is no inflammation and no hot applications.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If however there is inflammation or heat: then place above it the thing that is lying on the heat, and it will remove the inflammation: and let it be for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie up the needles above it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the needles be made from the middle of a cane, sawn in two, and cut into a fine point: or they may be made from wood, from which broom is made, or from palm branches, or from calamus: and the width of all the needles should be according to this form and shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it should be the needle that is placed on the same piece of flesh that is the largest and most slender, than the others; and the length of the needle should be according to what can be allowed for the member, according to its size and thickness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie up the needles above the other incision, according to the first tightening.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie up below with threads according to the first tightening, as we have said about the binding; and it should be that your binding is higher on the spot of the fracture than the previous one, and the more it extends from the fracture, the smaller the binding.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it should be that the middle thread is of medium thickness and soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as is seen in the operation of the stupid ones, their threads from twisted linen fall away because of it: for the binding falls off because of it.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	The fine threads do not come together again: for you do not achieve that which you wish through the stricture with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	It is not necessary for it to be between a star and a star smaller than a finger.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If it is affected by the weak through the extremities of the stars after the stricture in the healthy places: then place under them from the woolen ointment gently, or the caramelized wool, until nothing is harmed from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however there is a fracture with the elbow, and it happens to be disrupted in the skin, I recall it according to its individuality in the chapter.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you know that not every limb fractured should be tied with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is because when the limb is large, it is not necessary to put stars above it unless after five days, seven days, or more, according to your security from the event of your apostleship, hot wax.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way of ointments which were made by the ancients, which are placed over the fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	Common method of ointment, restoring the fracture, suitable for more complexions, especially women and children: for it is from that which does not kindle heat, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, and it is the brain of the flour which hangs in the walls of the mill at the time of the grinding of the mill: and you place it thus, except that you do not crumble it with the thumb: and you place the confection of it neither thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of ointment for restoring the fracture and dislocation and torsion.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Remedy for strengthening the voice, praised by all, acacia, unguent, and mucilage, and myrrh, and aloes of Comoros, and alethium 20 parts, and all other spices are mixed together with water of alchemy: or with albume oui, if the complexion is weak, it is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this ointment.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and it benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of ointment, which also cures fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe for mucilage, and myrrh, and white aloe, all ʒ X myrrhae, and aloes of Comoros ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX parts are mixed together with great grief, and they are shorn, and they are made into ointment with water or albume oui: and they are given.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Another method of ointment for joining, and bones separated from their place: and it soothes the pain of accidents to them, and it heals the fractures and separations.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	The wax is allowed to stick, and it is dipped in vinegar, and the decocted oil: and it is placed on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this ointment there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good for the sedation of hot applications: and it expels the pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Another method of ointment that restores the broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Gather the leaves of the fig tree and the white leaves of the aspen: and beat them all together and make an ointment from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Another method of ointment for shortening the time of restoration of the broken bone: and when you want to give the remaining hot applications.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe of the root of the old plant, and chamomile, and flowers of the herbs, and all parts of a bunch in equal part: they will be made for all, and bound with wine, if there is no heated member.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If the member is heated, then bind it with a damp coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A method of plastering another stronger in resolution than this first, when hard aposteme happens during the restoration of the member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe of the root of the old plant, and linseed, and balsam, and yarrow, and savory, and chamomile, and all flowers in equal part, they will be made for all, and bound with salt water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	The whole of this according to the heat of the member, and quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates said in his book that it should be placed on the broken member during its restoration, unless carbuncle is made from the stone, and oil: nothing else: and he said that it should be between the grossness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen says that it is good to place on the broken member during its restoration, in which there is heat exudation, such as myrrh, and aloes, and olibanum, and similar ones from them of which we have spoken.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A method of plastering that is used for the wound and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe of mug and chickpeas, and the sharp teeth of human hair, or the feather, and old plants, and all parts in equal amounts: they will be made for, and sheared, and bound, and a plaster will be made from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity, according to what should be, that remains the suture, then it is loosened, is such that you consider then, if not the patient suffers pain, nor itches, nor moves the fractured bone from its place: then you do not resolve it days many.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If however it happens to him in the place pruritus, or pain, or inflammation: then immediately, and loosen it in its own hour, and take off the plaster from it: and receive a soft bandage, or a wet sea sponge, moist: and submerge it in warm water, and wash away with it the place, until the pruritus is quiet, and sits down the pain.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place over it a linen cloth on it, submerged in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind over it at night for one night, until you are secure from the hot pinch, and the pain in the member is quiet, and sits down.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the member to the fine bandage and the thin plaster: and do not tie it with your first constriction, and the fine with it, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the pinch, and redness, and pain, and inflammation, and all other things removed completely, and you need plaster and bandage, then repeat this as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If something of what I said does not happen to the limb, then do not loosen it unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it has been for twenty days, the whole of this, according to what appears to you from the loosening of the limb, as I said, until the fracture adheres, and the coagulation of the flesh is applied over it: and also at that time in the bandage more than in your first bandage entirely: and also in the increase of weak food, according to what precedes the remembrance of this.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see a place where the wound has already dried out and been scraped, and has been rubbed beyond what is necessary: then you know that nourishment is forbidden to be applied to it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, let the wound be embrocated with warm water at all times where it is possible to apply it, and let it be done for three days, and let it be tightly closed.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Therefore, food is given to the member for this operation, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	However, what they do with stupid restorers is to give nourishment to the member from the fracture of the limb, when it does not heal at first, according to what is appropriate, and heals according to the tortuosity, it is an error in their operation, and a great fear: and if it were right, they would have said that in their books, and they had operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I do not see any of their traces in that at all, and it is better that it is not done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Regarding the accident that occurred in the head.
Caput III.	3rd head.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of the fracture are diverse, and the figures of it are many: and the causes of it are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from the fracture is that which happens by a blow with a hammer: and the blow removes the whole bone until it has been moistened to the siphon, which is under the bone, as does the axle in the wood, therefore this species of fracture is called the Axial one.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Sometimes the hammer strikes some bones, and it strikes the face of it, and does not penetrate the cut to the end of it, and this species of fracture is called the Kalan one, that is, Absolute Luxation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a joint of two fractures, or great or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from the fracture that is abrasion or abrasion, and its cause is a strike with a stone, or a chance on the stone, or such like.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also or perforating, which is approaching the pannicle, which is under the bone: or it is in the face of the bones: and it is a fracture of these two small or large fragments.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from the fracture that is hidden in the bone in the subtlety of the hair: and it is a small fissure, and for this reason this species of the fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is a fracture that is made by chance or by a strike with a stone, and such like, which make it go into the slice of the bone to the interior, and it becomes a concussion: just as happens when hot air is struck by them, and it goes into parts of them to the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this is done most of all in the heads of moist bones, such as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fractures are separated and become distinct, and I return to this memory of the whole in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these kinds of fractures by detection on it, and by the investigation of them when we touch them, and by the removal of the corrupt flesh which is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	However, the species of Capillaris is known by this, that it is detected on the bone, and removed, and covered over with wax on it: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	However, in the treatment of the fracture, consider first the accidents of the weak: then if you see from the accidents that signify a manifest danger with fear, such as diarrhea, and extension, and loss of intelligence, and glottis, and abscess, and acute fever, and exit of eyes, and redness of them, and such like from many accidents, it is not likely to be cured: and if you see accidents that do not frighten you and hope for health, then begin the care of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	When it comes to a wound that has first been inflicted, it is necessary to study the removal of bones before the fourthteen day of the month, according to all arrangements.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the months of summer, then it is necessary to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the flesh under the bone becomes rotten, and those things that we have mentioned will occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is with small pieces, and with attraction, then it is necessary to remove the part that is comminuted and attrited, according to what I will tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is like the removal of the head of a wounded head: remove the skull above the bone according to whatever possible way is for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is weakest above the weakest.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens to you during the detection of the bone, the flow of blood or hot apostema, then place it with what is necessary next to it.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is like filling the place with injected membranes in the wine, and rose oil: and make the elbow rest, until the apostema is settled, and be careful about the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the care of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And it is done according to one of two modes.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One mode is to remove the bone with a scalpel in a straight line: and this is its shape.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another scalpel after the first one is wide: and this is its shape.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also administer another scalpel that is wider than the previous one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second mode is to have a number of scalpels of different sizes: some of which are wider than others, and some of which are narrower than others: and they should be at the end of the last cutting edge, and they should be made of iron or steel: and use ease in percussion on the scalpel, so that it does not hurt the head, and harms it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If however the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary to make an incision around its circumference, before you administer the forceps, as the terebras, which are called terebins, do not pierce but cut, and are not called so because they do not reach the end of the cartilage to that which is after it, because the terebra is the rounded extremity above that which is the sharp edge under the head of the bone, similar to a margin, and a smaller ring prevents it from being submerged and passing through the density of the bones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it suits you, that you take from these terebras a great number, of which one concurs with the quantity of density of the bones, until the present head of the terebra is before you: whose sharp end in length and breadth is according to the quantity of density of that cranium.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three kinds of terebras, or trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	However, the quality of perforating around the fractured bone is: that you place the terebra on the bone and turn it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has been almost perforated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the terebra to another place, and place that which is between all the holes of the radius in quantity of breadth, or about this.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the forceps that is between all the holes of the bone: and make it finer than you can on the end of the fractured part, as we said, until you remove the bone with your hand, or with any other instrument which you have prepared for this, such as tenails, and thin forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you take all precaution to see that the terebra does not touch the forceps, or any part of the syringe.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have surrounded the bone with the drill and separated it from the siphon, if it is continuous with it, and take it out, it is necessary that you sharpen the edges, and make them equal at both ends which remains in the bone with another similar instrument such as an incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that it be thinner and more delicate with others of the same type.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If something remains in the bones, and it is hard: then take it with ease, with that which is at your disposal from the instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then take care of the wound after that with the ointments that I have mentioned, and the liniments.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, indeed far from fear: which Galen said and highly praised it, and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	First of all, it is necessary for you to begin to expose a part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more severe and manifest: until when you have detached that part and placed its end under the extremity of this lenticular Incisor, whose this is the form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the part of the lenticular one is not sharp, and the sharp part of it is on both sides of it, going in length as you see: so that the lenticular part be attached to the siphon, its sharp face incident on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike it with the hammer from the one side with a small mallet, until you detach the whole bone with ease, as it turns: and you will be secure from the blanket, which does not happen in that which you fear infinitely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not more foolish than man, and more ignorant of it, and was not sleeping, then if something remained attached to the bone from the blanket in some places, it would detach it from the extremity of the lenticular Incisor of its own, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	This book is released by him without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	If the fracture does not penetrate up to the fascia, and the part that is separated from the bone is the appearance of it, and the roughness and subtlety of the hair remain in the same: then it is necessary to remove this roughness and the subtle hairs with thin rasps, as you have prepared a number of different quantities of them, so that it is possible for you to apply some of them in every convenient place and righter ones of them, according to what leads to the operation you are performing, and the broken bone and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary for you to apply them in proportion to your own, which is first the rasps of the bone.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use a finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing this according to continuity, until you become more skilled in applying it more gently and subtly of all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	However, in each of the remaining small fissures and subtle fractures, it is necessary to apply attention according to what leads to the correction of its figure.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And there is a thing which is not hidden over everything, which in this art is the desire of everyone, and it stands over what we have written and shown in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	However, if the fascia is detected and retains the membrane, when you remove the bone: then it is necessary to take a linen bandage according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another linen bandage, either doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first bandage: and do this as easily as you can, so that it does not become greasy.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer it over the wide ligament: and do not strain it, unless by the quantity that holds the thigh only: and release it with this care once a day, or for two days, until you are secure from the hot nail.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and administer after that the medicine with which there is superfluous dryness, such as the roots of lilies, and flour of herbs, and powder of thurible, and aristolochia, and such like; and it is as if you were making a child who would be dried on the thigh as those are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer to it all medicine of which the property is to ablate, and not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care according to your virtue, that the thigh be clean in your curing: neither let there be sores on it, nor dregs of ointments, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor release the urine to gather in it altogether, because when urine gathers on the brain pan, it corrupts it, and putsrefies it, and happens to the weak after that great malice: and it has already happened in the infected skull, when the mouth of it is being cleaned from it, especially when care is neglected, a blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider now, if such accidents happen to the weak, you know that it is incurable probably.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not happen, unless from the medicine which is put over it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine to make it black: then you must take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linen with them a piece of cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it over the infected skull: then care for it with the specimens of the curing which come together, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	The restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose is not broken except when two of its upper parts are broken at the same time, or one of them: for they are two bones: therefore, because they are two bones, it does not break the lower part, which is cartilage, and it does not happen to it except abrasion, tortuosity, and similarity.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its upper parts is broken, then it is necessary to insert a small digit into the nostril, and indicate the fracture with your thumb, and with a deformed finger, until the nose returns to its natural figure: and it should be done artfully, with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware that it does not happen by your operation on the weak pain.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not go to that digit: then it is necessary to make equal to the end of the radius, in which there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in two parts, then make it like that: and as soon as the restoration is made on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at quiet at night, apply hot sticks.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a linen bandage, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two linen bands if the fracture is in two parts: and let the thickness of the linen be so much as to fill the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some ancient restorers have said that the linen should be wetted with butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	This does not seem to me, but rather it is necessary that the linen be wetted with honey and completely mixed with flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then release the linen, until the bone is firm and the cartilage is hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when it is introduced into the nose at the place of a goose feather, after being covered with soft linen: and it becomes, that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and prevents weakness from inhaling.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do this: and if you wish, make the linen.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If the nose is burned again while you are working, apply a plaster to the nose with hot oil, or with oil soaked in rose-colored oil, or a small amount of ointment made from alum.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If the nose is not burned hot, then it is necessary to apply a plaster with flour and powdered turmeric with white gum.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place over the plaster a soft linen bandage, and do not bind the nose tightly with anything.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, then it is necessary to cut under them and take them out with the tools that are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then care for the cut with what becomes inflamed and condensed, and make it strong with suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If the nostril is injured, then it is necessary to treat it with linen and give a lead tube until it recovers.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	¶ Regarding the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken:
Caput V.	5. Head.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not with the cheek: then consider if the fracture of it is only deformed, and not broken into two, and whether it is curved towards the inside: then recognition of it is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	If the fracture is in the right part of the bone, you must insert your left thumb into the weakened left jaw: similarly, if the fracture is in the left mandible, then insert your right hand: and press with it the exhaustion of the fracture, with ease, from the inside to the outside with your other hand, and make it equal to the same.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the mandible fracture has already been separated into two parts, then it is necessary to give extension from two parts according to straightness, until it is possible to make it equal.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however, already there is an excitement or disruption in the teeth, then tighten those from which you hope that the remaining ones will remain with gold wire, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a cradle over the broken mandible.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a double band over it, and place a large magnifying glass or a equal frustum of the sole skin on it, in the length of the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it up from below according to what is prepared for the ligature of this, and it fits its application until it is not destroyed, and order the patient to be calm and quiet, and place a soft food of his hunger.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If however, you think that something has already changed in any figure of any mode: then immediately and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has changed from it, and apply the plaster to the dough with alabaster or with flour sieve, after you have removed the cradle: and place a soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While this plaster is still attached to it and does not change the position of the bones, release it, so as not to loosen it, until it heals: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is held together by many strings for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If an acute burn occurs meantime, then administer that which we called many strings for its sedatation, until the burn is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with the thigh, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Then separate the piece from the bone, or from the splinter: then use your fingers to remove that splinter with what suits you for the removal of those from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If however the wound opening is tight, then enlarge it with the phlebotomy according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed that splinter, and there is nothing left of it, then if the wound opening is wide, then enlarge it; and if not, put on top of it with ointments that suit you for this, and let them marinate until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	¶ Restoration of the Wing: When it breaks.
Caput VI.	Head VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed the wing is broken from the front part of the shoulder, and the fracture of it is made according to one third of the mode.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or if it is broken and separated into two, except for what happens in the splinter, it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or that which happens in the bone splinter: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or that which is a fracture with the thigh: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation on it when the fracture is without the thigh is, that you make present two ministers, so that one of them holds the aid that follows the broken wing, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make an equal fracture with your fingers, until it has the form that it should have, and there should not be any prominence or concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you require further extension, then it is necessary to place under a thin, weak sphere made of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to the quantity required by you: extend it, take the goose wing, and with your hand pull out the sphere, until the even fracture is made according to what is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot pull the end of the goose wing to its outer edge: because it is too deep: then it is necessary to have the weak one over the gauze of it: and place under the shoulder of it a medium-sized pulley, and put the shoulder of it at the lower part, until the bone of the goose wing that is in the deep end rises up to the upper part: and then rectify the fracture and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If however you feel saturation from the goose wing, and it moves: then it is necessary to take the saturated one away from that, and pull it out with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If however it is held in the bone, then use your ingenuity in the incision of that one tooth which you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the goose wing the instrument that suits the sifach: and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It should be similar to the cochlea without connection.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to the size of the bone and its proportions.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	However, its length should also be according to what is possible for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends as you see: and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If however the wound that you cut when you took out the saturated bone is wide and secure from the hot aposteme: then gather the two lips of the wound with the suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	If disruption is small, or you fear hot aftercut: then fill the wound with bandages, and stitches according to the extent of the cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot aftercut occurs, then pour bandages in rose oil, vinegar, wine, and place on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	When the stricture of the bone is without a wound and without a section, it is, as you place on top of the bone an ointment made from flour with almond oil.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft splint on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under the soft one, if you need that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a hammer, that is, the round wheel that the Saracens hold, which is long and of about the same width as a palm of one hand, or about this.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled bandage on top of the splint and ointment.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a star from a fine table, whose width is three fingers, and lengthwise similarly.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then cover it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then cover the bandage with the star in the place where the hammer falls on the fracture and the wound.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the hammer on the fracture as it revolves, and cover it over the neck of it, and under the soft and hard shoulder, and under the soft and hard wrist: and bring it back over all parts, and how you see that the stricture holds the fracture stricture decently, and is this, which is not hidden over you, and whole, so that the star does not fall off from the broken bone above.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And therefore it is necessary to look at the weak one every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever you see the star already falling out, then straighten it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place a pillow under the weak part of its back, and place a small pillow under the pillow of its neck at night, so that when it turns to its side, it can support itself with its own side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	It then heals the fracture of the shoulder by elevation.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or tie its arm to the collar of its own neck: and do not untie the ligament, unless it does not happen in the place where it should be, or due to pruritus, up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then reapply the plaster, if you see the face of its head towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the closure, and release it, until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the shoulder is indeed tightened and strengthened according to the most in twenty days: and sometimes it happens in some people in a smaller one.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	¶ About the restoration of the fracture of the spatula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The spatula is rarely broken, and in the side of its handle: and they are not broken from it except the edges of it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it is broken from that place, and it is broken in the middle of its handle, and it is not known except by touch: then according to the figure of the fracture, make a preparation for it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it over the natural figure of all ways of the genius, which is possible to you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place on the place of the millstone with the eye of the almond, and a soft stitch, and place under the small piece of cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place on it a flat star from the thin table according to the quantity of the spatula of all, or a larger one a little.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If however there is cohesion in some places of the spatula, then equal it with a soft stitch, until the star descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then, when the thread is sufficiently long, it should be tied with a firm knot, and held in place with a steady star, until it is no longer removed from its position.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage throughout the day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whichever way the bandage is softened, tie it up again, and if the starry point is removed from its place: let it be weak on the sound side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula will be restored in nineteen days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is completed, then untie the bandage: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For this is from the bones which are not feared for their union, nor for their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if it proceeds from a bone fragment, and punctures the skin: then cut it off above, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what I have said in the fracture of the sternum from heat applications, if something comes out of it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	¶ On the restoration of the fracture of the breast.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breast sometimes breaks in the middle, and this hardly happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	However, the extremities of it are most broken and cut off by its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle of it breaks, which leans towards the lower parts, and pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and hacking come on, and perhaps blood comes out, and the fracture of the bone is declared, and not hidden from sense: the restoration of it is to be made, so that the weak one lies on the back of its breast: and place between the spatulas of it.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press the shoulders of it, and gather up the ribs from two sides or parts with your hands: and make them as equal as possible in this regard, according to all the way that can be done for it, until the figure of the bones returns, according to what is fitting.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place the plaster and ointment on top of it, and then place beneath it a star from a thin sheet of glass or salt, or similar, after you have moistened it in the cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then make the bandage thinner over the fractured bone so it does not come loose: and unravel the bandage according to the roundness of the back, and tighten it appropriately.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage at all times and as often as it softens, tighten it: and if the necessity of its solution arises from pruritus, or corrosion that occurs in the location, or pain, or abscess, then immediately dissolve it, and remove the ointment, and rectify what happens with the mode of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the ointment, if you see towards that face: and attach it to the tight one, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	¶ Regarding the restoration of noses, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Head Nine.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that the fracture of noses does not happen unless it is in the thick parts of the back, and from the extremities of their anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them to be torn unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the senses at the examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration of it is made so that the broken one is equalled by the fingers according to the possible mode, until the figure is equal to what is appropriate.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply the ointment, and tighten the broken bone with the star, if there is a need for it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the nose is inclined to the interior: then a less painful dolor occurs, and puncture, as the puncture that happens to him who has a cold: therefore, because the bone is pricked, and also difficulty of thirst, and coughing, and bloody vomiting, occur, and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	The ancient ingenious ones have already become skilled in it with many arts: and among them are those who say that you should place weak foods which generate inflammation and viscidity, so that the stomach inflames, extends, and pushes the fracture to the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We, however, detest it, so that it does not become a cause of excess heat for making a hot sty, unless it happens.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If it has already happened, then add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	Certain of them have said that weak food should be placed over the place, then it is drawn up with strength, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Nevertheless, they fear that the weak food attracts superfluities to the place, because of the weakness of the position.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	Certain of them have said that it is necessary to cover the place with wool which has already been dipped in hot oil: and they place pulled-out flesh between the ribs, until it is full: so that it becomes an equal bandage when it is tied according to the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then, the weak cure is made with care from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	That if we make the weak one too tight, which it does not tolerate, and the mouth pierces the painful point with a sharp needle, and we fear for the weak one: then it is necessary to cut over the place, and let go of the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we will place over it an instrument that keeps the wound clean, of which the recollection precedes: and we will insert the mouth with facility, and we will insert it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we will aggregate two lips of the wound, if it is large with suture: and we will care for it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	That if the hot sty happens in the meantime, then immediately, and pour over olive oil which is red, and place over the place: and care for the weak one who comes with the sty.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Until it heals, a dressing should be applied over the side where the wound is located.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	The restoration of a spinal column fracture involves reducing the fracture fragments, aligning the vertebrae, and immobilizing the spine with a brace or cast. The goal is to reestablish the normal anatomy and prevent further displacement of the bones.
Caput X.	I assume you are referring to Chapter 10, but without additional context, I cannot provide a more specific translation. Please provide more details if you need a more detailed response.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	While fractures of the collarbone can sometimes occur, they are rare and usually result in a simple fracture. Similarly, fractures of the spinal column are less common but can be more complex to treat.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When a fracture occurs in someone, and you want to know if it will heal or not, then trust in the process of healing.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	If you see the hands of someone who are already softened, stupefied, and lifeless, and cannot move them, extend them, or contract them, and when you contract them with your fingers and press them with a needle, they do not feel any pain, and do not feel any suffering in them, then you know that it is not healing, and there are many ways in which it can be fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If it moves them and they feel a contraction with their fingers and a prick with a needle, then you know that the spine bones are healthy, and that the person will heal with proper treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If you see the spinal bones similar to that one, and you want to know if it will heal or not, then consider the feet of that person. If you see that they are softened, and the same thing happens in their hands, then when they lie on their back, they emit gas and waste without will: and when they are laid on their stomach, they emit gas without will: and when they are laid on their back, and they want to move, and cannot, then you know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	This translates to: "Therefore, no troubles in its care.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	This translates to: "If not, it is better for him if nothing happens from it.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	This translates to: "And the treatment of what happens from it is that you apply for sedation with hot sponges: so, that you put on top of the spine, only olive oil that has been heated: or when you cut, you anesthetize.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	This translates to: "Put on top of it several times in the day until the hot sponge is anesthetized: then put on top of a place one of the comforting, drying plasters, and tie it over it with a bandage: and instruct the patient to use quietness and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	This translates to: "Nor let him sleep on the part where he found pain, until it is cured.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	This translates to: "If it happens at the attrition of bones, or if something has already been separated from it: then it is necessary to remove it from the skin and take that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	This translates to: "Then gather two lips of the wound, if it is large, with the suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	This translates to: "Then care for it with some ointment, until it is cured.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	This translates to: "If it happens that the last bones of the hindquarters are broken, and there is no end to the tail: then it is necessary to insert the left hand's fist into the anus, and adjust the broken bone with the other hand, according to what is possible, and secondly according to the proportion.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	This translates to: "Then put on top of it, and remove it: and care for the thigh with the treatment that preceded it, until it is cured.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	This translates to: "Regarding the restoration of Ancha.
Caput XI.	This translates to: "Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	This translates to: "Bones of the Ancha head are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then the fracture of those is not, unless it is a comminution at their extremities: and they are divided in length, and turned inwards: and there occurs pain in the place, and a puncture: and the thigh that is broken becomes still.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration indeed is, that you stretch out your hand over it, until you stand over the figure of it as it is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at the extremities of it, then you equal that fracture to that which is prepared for you according to the proportion, until it becomes like the figure of its own nature.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is in length, or already turns inwards: then let the weak one lie down over its own vein, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have equalled it, put the plaster over it: then put over it a star made of wood, or from the skin: and tighten the strain over that, not fearing the change of the fracture, nor the removal of the star.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And the equal filling of those with that which fills it, until it takes the strain according to equality: and bid the weak one, that he sleep on his back, or on his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if a hot sponge comes to him: then cease from the extension of it, and from its restoration, until the hot sponge is settled: and put over it that which sets over it, according to that which precedes: and return to the restoration of it, and tighten it as it is fitting.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if a dead bone comes, or is comminuted: take it out.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	¶ About the restoration of the fracture of the Helper.
Caput XII.	Caput XII. (Chapter 12)
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	This is a spatula, used from the armpit to the head.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two drachms.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	The first is: take a flat wood of medium size, following this shape.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two cords are tied at the two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is hung from the elevated place: and the weak one sits on the seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the middle of the grain of the wood that is anchored to it.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above him, so that it extends his hand to the lower part.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician should examine the broken bones of his hands simultaneously, until the fracture heals according to what is appropriate.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is: let the weak one sit above his neck collar: and hang his hand from the neck of his collar with the cord.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two attendants to hold one of them with the thing that is above the fracture with his hands, and the other to hold the lower part, and extend each of them to their own part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you want the extension to be stronger, then tie under the fracture with the cord, and above it with another cord: and extend it each of the two attendants to their own parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it is appropriate to put one cord under the elbow, and the other under the fracture at the shoulder.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is appropriate to put the cord above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then make the equal fracture with ease, without labor, until when the fracture is equal according to what should be, and applied well: then tighten it, if not cause a hot burn.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If indeed a hot burn occurs, then release the tightened one until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And then place a burned-through piece of wool dipped in vinegar and rose oil on it, until the burn subsides: then tighten it: and the way to tighten it is to place the plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a new cloth soaking on the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he will gather the arm over the helper, and put his open hand over his own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And then place the cloth, and tighten over the helper's arm, so that the arm stands in the place of the stars: if it does not prevent you from anything, nor will it change anything over your bone fracture.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something will change over your bone fracture, then use the stars: and it is good to place the star which is larger and stronger over the fracture itself.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between all the stars' width of the finger: and the length of the stars should be according to the fracture with the addition of three digits from all sides.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten over the stars the stricture which I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is good that your stricture be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is extended, the smaller the stricture should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If then you see the placement of the stars and the stricture as I said, in the hour that you restore the member, then do: and if you fear a hot burn, then release the stricture and the stars until the seventh day, as I said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in all three days, so that no inflammation, itching, or restriction of food intake to the member, due to the stricture of the superfluous part, occurs.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore, correct that entire statement according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you are overconfident and nothing comes from it: then do not dissolve the ligament unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let him sleep weakly on his back, and his hand on his stomach: and place under support a full woolen cloak evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at all times of the night or day, whether the figure of the broken member does not become dissolved, or the ligament is softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore, correct this entire matter with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food weakly according to the order we have prescribed, so that the food is first soft, until it begins to string the mouth: then it must be made to ingest more of that food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the customary aid and crutch is to string in forty days: therefore it must be dissolved then, and a bath given, and it is treated with ointments that strengthen that.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is a grievous one, drawn out: then do not dissolve from it the ligament and stars up to fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Regarding the restoration of the Fracture of the Biceps.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The Biceps is composed of two bones, which are called the two foci.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small: and that is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and that is the one that is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps the larger focile will be broken, or the smaller one: and perhaps both will be broken at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When the smaller focile above is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its cure is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower focile is broken, it is a bad fracture, and its cure is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones are broken at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If the bone that is broken is the smaller one above, then it is convenient for the physician in the restoration of it, to put a slight extension on it until it is straight.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If the bone that is broken is the larger one, then it should be necessary to put on a stronger tighten.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it should be necessary to put the figure of the hand on the restoration of it, and its extended extension above the pulley.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers: and the inferior joint of the finger should be on all the fingers, or elsewhere: and the weaker sitting quadratus across itself, and the pulley in front of it, or in the direction of it, at an elevation, so that the weaker does not encounter the labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then he will extend the assistant from the lower part of the arm, or with his own hand, or with a tie.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And the other assistant will extend similarly above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician will straighten the bone, until it is in a better figure than it can be.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are wedges in the fracture of the bones, then you should dare to reduce all the fragment into its place with your virtue.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If it seems that there is a separate wedge in it, and it punches the skin, and there is no hope in its restoration: then find above it, and remove it according to the mode which I have said for those which were previously mentioned.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If a fracture occurs with the elbow, I have already dealt with that particular case, therefore take care of its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If a hot apostematous eruption occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then apply a linen bandage with the melted oil of roses, the white thorn, and a medium between density and fineness: and tie the bandage over the narrow opening, until it is sated by the apostematous eruption: then remove the thorn, and place the prepared plaster from the mill with almond:
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place stars, and let the star that is placed over the fracture be slightly larger and stronger:
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of stars in the constellation of the Scorpion is six in several arrangements: whether the fracture is in one focus or in two at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your tight and strong bandage over the fracture site, with a little more above the superior fracture or below it: or place a gentle bandage with a narrower stricture as remembered at the beginning of the chapter:
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And the bandages that cover the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or sharp:
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread used to tie the bandage be of the proper linen, between thin and coarse, as we have mentioned:
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and ligament after a day:
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something is needed for correction, such as a pruritus that occurs in the member: then it is necessary to embrocate the member with hot water, until the pruritus is quiet and release the unconstrained member, until it is quiet, and then repeat the bandage:
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage has already been softened and the bone is remote, and similar to this: then correct this entirely with your virtue, and consider again:
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If nourishment is prohibited from being applied to the part, because of excessive tightening, then it should be made softer as soon as possible, and allowed to rest for a few days, until it naturally curries towards the food, and then it should be tightened.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If however nothing unwell happens to those things I have mentioned, then it does not need to be loosened, unless after twenty days, or nearly so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the weak one is hung over his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be equal, and let it be guarded by the virtue of its own movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep over his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And you know that this fracture is cured in thirty days, or in thirty-two days, perhaps in nineteen days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	The whole of this depends on the dispositions of the complexions, and the dispositions of the virtues.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	¶ On the restoration of wrist fractures.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	You know that wrist fractures are rare in the fingers and toes.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to it, except from frequent rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When however a plantar fracture or attrition occurs, then it should be made to rest on the weak quadratus: and let the seat be in front according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand over that extended one.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the attendant should extend the broken bone, and adjust it according to the physician, until they are united by a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it should be necessary to put on the plaster and bandage, if not an erysipelas is hot.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the asthma over the part according to the quantity of the part: and you have already covered it with linen.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is to the lower part of the heel approximately in the arch of the foot, then make a similar sphere from cloth and tell the patient to wrap it around with his own sole fractured, and then tie it with a long piece of string.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And the splint should be made of horsehide, in which there is flexibility, so that the skin can be applied to the sole of the foot and tied with a string according to what is appropriate.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is to the outside, then it is appropriate to place the splint on top of it and another one from the sole upwards, and the hand should be straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place the tightening bandage as the hand turns, and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a bone of a digit is broken, then if it is the thumb, it should be treated according to what is appropriate.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it with the sole: and if you love, place the straight splint on it, small: so that the fracture may be pulled up and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is in the remaining digits such as the middle, index, or aural, and ring fingers, then it should be treated equally, and it is placed with the healthy toe that follows it, or they are all tied according to the continuation, and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place the small splint on top of it as we have said in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration and after the same arrangement you postpone the hot stakes: and place with it what is appropriate when something comes from it according to the report of its narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	¶ About the restoration of the hip fracture.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken and is declared by the senses because it turns to the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	The restoration of this part is done in such a way that the ligament above the fracture is drawn tight and another ligament is placed below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the weak side is stretched out on its face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he will stretch out all the ligaments that are subordinate to it according to their equality: and this when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	However, if the fracture is near the root of the hip bone, then the ligament to the part of the cartilage should be stretched upwards, and another ligament should be placed below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And so if the fracture is near the knee, then the ligament to the knee should be stretched downwards, and the extension should be to the lower part.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon should adjust the bone of both hands until he reduces it according to the likeness of the natural figure: and he should join the bone with a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to put on a plaster and bandage, if the member does not become gangrenous.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If it does happen in the member: then let him release it for a few days, until the gangrene is hot, and then return to your care.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	However, his bandage should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to cover over the fracture with a strong bandage, that is, a binding: and it should be covered twice or three times: and there should be some left over from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then cover the leg, until the heel of the calf passes by the root of the leg.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee, and let its ends be on the two parts of the upper part.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the thigh and the hip that is left over from the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place a tile on top of the Coxa in the location of the fracture of the same star, and place one star on the os cruri above it.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the joints between the thigh and the hip with soft bandages, so as to equalize the tightness.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong tightening from the middle, using three or four folds around the location of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you stretch the ligament from the location of the fracture, your tightness should be less and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then pay attention to the two ends of the filament you have inserted between the hip and the thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie it with three stars that are above, as mentioned earlier.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then hold the filament with its two ends at the lower part, until the swelling reaches the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And tighten the strings of the stars on both sides so that the ligament does not come out of its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the tightness on that part, while it remains, so that it does not cause corrosion, nor apostemas, nor inflammation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, with the remedy for this, and correct what happens from there, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If I say, if it is a fragment from the bone that hurts: then it is necessary, if it is possible for you to do so.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find above it and remove it: and take care with the one that precedes the recollection, until it becomes well.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is tightened, besides the stars added to it as we have said in the aid and arm,
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	In fact, in the restoration of such a broken bone, no weakness or limping occurs.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, except for the application of another leg, then it is necessary that he who has it should always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you know that the thigh is tightened or added or reduced in fifty days, or according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions, it is all this.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	¶ Regarding the restoration of the broken kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Head XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You know that the kneecap is rarely broken, but it often happens to it with attrition.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed a break happens to it, then not except for a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is this both with the thigh and without the thigh.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over this entirely with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is so that it becomes equal to what was broken from its parts with fingers, until it is gathered and united according to what is possible from the equation and facility and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place the plaster made from flour of wheat or a mill with almond: and place on top of it a round star, if you need that: and tighten down from the suitable strap for this.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions that we have mentioned in the other fractures, such as the burned knee, and so on: in such a way that you place every accident with that which is suitable for it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	¶ Regarding the restoration of the broken thigh.
Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You know that the thighs are two bones, one of which is large and is called the thigh, and the other is fine and is called the focile.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	It happens that both types of fractures occur in the two bones of the arm: and for this reason it is restored to him, just as the restoration of the arm is equal, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones break at once, the crus is converted to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the bone is broken more gently, it is converted to the anterior part of the crus.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the bone is broken more roughly, you will find it lower: and these are the ones that do not hide anything from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and equality, and binding of the stars according to this equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	Indeed, it is necessary that if the fracture of the thigh is a grievous fracture, having many seths, then the extension should be less, and your lenient treatment should be greater.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the thigh indeed, there is something peculiar to the arm: and it is that when you make equal stars on the arm, and complete all your operation, then take two strips from the pine wood, which is given in the making of solar tables which are laid under the slabs: and they are made from the palm's breadth: and choose from them those which have a small grossness, and they should not be small, and their length should be according to the length of the thigh from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then apply two folds on each strip according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the thigh from one part, and the other from another part: and they should be from the knee downwards of the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two strips in three places from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For if the compression is forbidden, the thigh leans to the right and left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	The cradle is already being managed according to the length of the thigh, and the thigh is placed in it to keep it from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	Even more especially, it is necessary for you to do this when there is a fracture and the wrist is properly placed.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the thigh in every day, and study with it the last studiousness from the staple, or inflammation, or other similar things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If then something happens from these, then place it against it with what is appropriate, until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the bone fracture of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	However, a calcaneal fracture does not usually occur.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, a bone fracture of the foot does sometimes occur, and a fracture of the toes also occurs: it does not occur unless there is an abrasion in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If you see the bone of the foot fracture and you notice that the bone is rising above itself and becoming more bent, then he places his weak foot on a prepared earth, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand up, and place your foot on that which is raised from these bones: then press or lace it: and the same one, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place the plaster, and remove the bandage: and place under the sole of the foot a small table with two flat caps on it.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tie it up with the foot bandage, after you have loosened it with the wool, and the rest that is needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When they are gone for three days, or four, then loose the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bone equal, if it is fractured, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation, as you see, is performed on them thusly.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If however some fingers are broken, then restore them, and equal them according to what I will inform you of in the restoration of fingers.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger tip on the star according to the length of the finger, and make it slightly larger than that: then place the sole of this tablet that I will inform you of under your finger tip and fasten it with a suitable fastening.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If however that which is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then place your finger tip on the star of its quantity, wrapped in a piece of linen cloth: and fasten the tablet under the sole of the foot: and let it stand upright on one capital of the tablet outside the heel of the foot, so as to maintain good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it will be convenient for you not to neglect the fact that you should consider all that I have told you about the other fractures from the accidents that I have mentioned: and place every accident with the one that is appropriate to it.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Regarding the fracture of the thigh bone of a woman, and the bones of the fingers of a man:
Caput XIX.	Head 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the thigh bone of a woman is broken, then make her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her towards the back part of herself, and hold her back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife of the woman with the thigh bone fills her hilt, until it is full: and it should be like a sphere in the woman.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman is shaken, and the back of her is gently raised.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For this hilt will exit until it is like a sphere before the door of the thigh bone, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a piece of cloth on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When you wish to insert, remove the stomach with ease, then insert it: and then return it according to the manner in which you first inserted it into the primary part: then return to the nearest part of it first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Do this for seven days, or approximately, as the bone itself will restore.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a silk thread, and tie it over the hole of the vessel, and then insert the entire silk thread into the vessel.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow gently into the canula with force, until the silk thread is inside the vessel, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with the stomach, and let it stand for a few days, according to what we have described, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the thumb or finger is broken, then administer in the healing of it, and according to the ratio we have described in the bone of the ankle.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And do not hide the right in these near fractures which are not rare, especially if there is some study or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book very much, because the fracture itself tells you in many ways to put the right bone in the healing of it and the tightening of it: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the bone of the finger is broken, take the guts of a goose: and insert the woman into it itself.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place on top of it the dressing from cloth, and it will be wrapped and let go for three days, or approximately, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	¶ Regarding the healing of the bone fracture when there is with the tendon.
Caput XX.	Head twenty.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	He is helped who has a fracture with the tendon, especially if it is large, such as the thigh bone, or an assistant, or similar to it, so that he can be near and suck the blood immediately: if you are assured of the conditions for phlebotomy, as we have said.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If blood oozes from the wound, then it is necessary to grind powdered bone over the spot where the blood flows, if nothing else is available to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to mend the fracture on that same day, and do not delay it if it does not happen to be a compound fracture.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed a compound fracture occurs, then postpone the mending of that fracture until the ninth day, until the wound has healed.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third or fourth day, for you are making it happen by your actions.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the fractured bone is projecting above the detected skin, then it is necessary to grasp and reduce it yourself, and to make it equal with your hands using ease and gentle extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If the extension and equating of that bone are not prepared, and you do not make it equal with your hands, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And this is the instrument made of iron, whose length is that of seven fingers or eight, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And therefore it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four according to the amount he needs for the treatment of that kind of fracture in every way.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round, and there should be small bulk on it, so that it does not double at the compression over it during the operation of an hour: and it should have sharp ends, where the margin is at the ends of its own.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And it should be above it up to the bulk from the middle of it to the lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation to place the sharp cut end of it above the projecting end of the bone: and push it with one hand until the bone returns and makes an equal equating.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, make the extremities of the fracture equal and even.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the fragment is thin and does not grasp it with the good reception, then it should try to make a cut at the end of that bone until the instrument has power.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce them with the one you mentioned earlier, then make a cut with the one you can find from the incisors we mentioned, or with any kind of knife possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then smooth out that which remains in the bone from its roughness and small grit.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone is reduced and finds a weak painful point after the reduction that is hard to bear, then you know that the bone has not been returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Therefore, do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you are giving a great pain to the patient when your restoration is complete for the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then dip the bandage in a black, wine-soaked cloth.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in the summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a poultice on the elbow, nor anything with oil in it, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption to occur in itself.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer stars in the hour of your completion for the bone's restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And release the detected elbow: so that you make a cut with the lancets according to the amount of the wound in the folds.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And be careful not to pull the elbow with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Indeed, many doctors have done this foolishly: and they have caused death, or putrefaction, or decay, that is, healthiness to their weak patients.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And your tightening should be soft, gentle, and various in the remaining fractures of the bandage.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is evil or is a large wound, and some things happen to it which we have mentioned, and you find pain in the hanging place: then it does not become appropriate for you to put stars on top of it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make these dressings from rough strips of cloth in the place of the stars, and tie them together with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when it has been one day or two days, and you see the wound beginning to grow, so that pus comes out of it: then take off the cloth which you have put on top of it with the gauze.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply a liniment, and ointment with what we are accustomed to, in order to heal the wound: such as tetraphthalamon, and like it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it will be helpful to you to dissolve the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day in the morning and evening, until it has healed and become well.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the member be prepared in such a way that the pus runs out from it to the lower parts with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass without the wound healing, and the pus does not come out of it, and the bones are full of small joints: then you know that there are small joints in it.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore, it is necessary to search for the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of them are separated from the small joints, remove them, and take them out.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those which are not separated from the small joints, and cause pain in the member, and make it happen that you want to remove them, and take them out in any way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If it happens that the wound is suppurating, or if it is bleeding, that is, if it is a sign of another kind of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to put one of them with the other that comes from the treatment of the member, whose story precedes in the chapter of it.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	When you wish to stand your speech, and when the bone is broken, and the wound appears on the limbs, such as the thigh bone, the shoulder, and similar parts of the limbs, it happens often that death ensues from this, therefore let it be forgotten, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall by itself in nineteen days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then take care of the knee, if you see it, and let it be if not, release it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	¶ About the treatment of a swelling in a broken bone.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This swelling often happens in the treatment of the cure of a broken bone.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, which is near the joints: and it becomes unsightly in its figure of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it forbids the limb from its natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider now, if the swelling is recent: administer to it medicines which have stiptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar of these.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, take some of these, or all of them: and confect a poultice with alcohol, or with albumen, or with vinegar: and put it on the swelling over the wound, and tie it tightly above the good closure.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And let it be loose for days many.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loose it, and put on another, until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tie it tightly over the leaden plate.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property to remove everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already come to the stone, and is tight, and there is a need to remove it quickly: then find over it from its superior part, and cut off the excessive protrusion: or scrape it with some sharp instruments, until it is removed, and take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	When treating and restoring the part, and if a small piece remains after that, it is not done according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored and a small piece remains after that, weak and brittle, it is not done except for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is, the multitude of the solution and ligation of its ligaments not according to what is proper: or because of the superfluity of the stricture of the ligaments, until it is forbidden for nourishment to run to the part: or because of the excessive embrocation at an inappropriate time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the weak body and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment of this is to feed the weak and tender body, until blood is multiplied in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and merry to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place a plaster on the part: so that it attracts the plaster to the food much.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And he will apply the embrocation of it with hot water, until the nourishment runs and returns to its natural figure.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	When bone fragments are restored and bent, it is treated as follows:
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When the member is already restored after the healing of the part, and the bent bone or fractured fragment is evident, or nodated: and it is deformed by that form of the bone, nevertheless the part is not prohibited from its natural operation: then it does not need to receive the speech of him who thinks that the member is broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done this on our earth.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	This indeed is a difficult operation, leading to death or great fear, so that it may be fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	However, if the cramp and knot are recent: then it should be rubbed with warm water, in which decoctions of gently-soothing herbs are added, such as the leaves of tall sage, and the root thereof, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make for it a plaster with a gently-soothing ointment, such as dyachilon made fittingly.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or consider mucilage of tall sage, and rub it with chicken fat, or olive oil: and apply it with this.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or use ripe figs, and bind them with fine linen thread, and similar ones named from decreasing remedies for consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is loosened by persistent rubbing, old, and gentle, which is made with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And the motion of the limbs is given to all parts in every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	However, if the tortuosity has already preceded, and is strong, and has turned to stone, and a need for attending to it with iron has been provoked: then it should be cut off above, and the continuity of bones be loosened, and what remains is that which is superfluous from the knot or bone with sharp saws, and ease is given in it with caution and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	¶ Of Speech in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of some joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore, movement is prohibited and the appearance of the limb is deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes pain to be felt on the infirm part, and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When then a dislocation happens to someone, it is necessary to hurry towards its restoration: nor does it delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	If it delays, the place will be postponed, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it is not necessary to delay, nor to extend in the hour of his postponement.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes a spasm, and painful wounds.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	Indeed, when that happens, it is necessary to hurry towards phlebotomy of the weak one.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then he will be released, until the postponement becomes quiet.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member will be rubbed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it will be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And all the member is to be cared for with that of which the memory will not be in its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I myself have already ordered the chapter of dislocation, even according to which the fracture precedes in the body from the upper part to the lower one of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	¶ About the care of the dislocation of the inferior mandible.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Few dislocations happen to the two mandibles unless rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the inferior one is made according to one or two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or rather they are removed from their places by a slight removal and are softened somewhat.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely and integrally, until they are softened to the chest, until the weak pulse is flowing, and it cannot hold it, nor can it close its mouth, and the tongue of it is uncovered with the speech of it.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however the dislocation of it is slight, then it returns to several positions by itself with a few number.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If indeed the dislocation is complete and entire, then it must be that a hasty reduction is to be made of its head, and it should not be delayed long: and it is fitting that the physician hold the weak head of the patient: and he inserts his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated mandible between the cheeks thereof, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts both of his hands simultaneously, if the dislocation is from two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the rest of his hand should be outside, by which it ought to be equalized.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And he commands the patient to clean his jaws and to free them for chewing to all parts.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician should equalize the jaw, and he drives the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If however the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are at once, then a hasty reduction is to be made of its other side, and he administers ointment with warm water and oil until a easy reduction of the other is made, and it should not be delayed long in reducing the other as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they are reduced and equalized, and the weak jaw is closed and not softened, then place above them some flax cloths soaked in rose oil, with which a certain thing has been made from wax: and let it be applied.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then he is to be gently bound with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the weak one be laid on his back, and his head stand between two flax cloths so that it does not move to the right and left: nor is he compelled or forced to chew anything: indeed, a soft drink of what he desires is placed under his jaw until the pains subside and the jaw nods, then he eats what he wishes and the drink is given with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not labor over the operation of his mouth at eating and drinking and nodding until the jaw is subsided and he is cured.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	When two mandibles are difficult to reduce after being dislocated in a certain hour and do not return to their original position, many fevers and frequent diarrhea often occur, and perhaps the cold stomach is relieved, and perhaps the sour choler is vomited.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see that, then you know that it is a loss, and that person often dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	¶ About the reduction of shoulder joint dislocation and its extremity.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	Indeed, the shoulder joint is not dislocated from the inner side due to its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated to the outside: and this is felt by touch.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And the restoration of it is, that it lie on his weak side on his back, and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then, place it in the right position with the palm of your hand, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place the bandage over it, and the plasters, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	But the extremities of these, which follow the elbow, and are continuous with it, are not dislocated, except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	When it is dislocated on a certain day: then it must be reduced and made equal according to what I have said, and prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place the bandage over it, and the plasters, and the bound one.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And advise the patient to remain in tranquility and quiet until he recovers.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when the same treatment is applied to the extremity of the shoulder, it also separates from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	¶ About the reduction of shoulder joint dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You know that the humerus does not dislocate unless it is done in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of them is, that it is dislocated to the part that is titillated towards the lower parts.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second way is, that it is dislocated to the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the humerus: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated to the back, because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it is most commonly dislocated and goes towards the lower parts, opposed to the titillated part: especially in those, where the flesh is few.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For they go into them easily, and they go in easily.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those where the flesh is many, it is opposite to that, because it goes with difficulty, and it goes with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men by hitting, or accident, and the humerus is struck hot, and it is thought because of that, that it is already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you should try this, until you are certain of it, and then proceed to the treatment of it.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And it is known that dislocation occurs when it is to the lower parts, opposed to the titillated part: and you can distinguish between the dislocated humerus and the sound humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find a manifest difference between them, and you will find in the head of the humerus a congestion, and under the titillated part at the touch of the head of the humerus as if it were one thing: and it cannot weakly return the hand to its own ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated to the front, or upwards: then you will find a manifest touch, and it will not be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	This particular dislocation makes the reduction of this type easier when it is recent or the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	The reduction of this is that he should raise his helper's hand to the higher parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your hands under the flap of it, and raise the joint with strength to the top to its own place: and the helper should raise his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he should place it lower, for he returns unsteadily himself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	However, if he does not return as we said, and the days that have passed since the dislocation began are many: then it is necessary to let the weak one bathe in hot water, and apply an embrocation that softens and soothes, just as if decoctions of high roots, such as ginger, and fenugreek, and mallow, were applied in water.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the weak one should rise on his back: and a sphere and wool that is equal between softness and tightness should be placed under the flap of it.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place his heel on the sphere, and raise the head of the arm with strength, and draw the weak hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another should hold the weak head, so that it does not move towards the lower parts: for he returns immediately himself.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this manner: and it is that the longer and weaker man should be present, and stand on the side, and insert his arm under the flap of the weaker one: and he should raise the flap of it to the higher parts, until it is weak hanging in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another should draw the weak hand downwards towards his vent.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	However, if the weak one is large: then it is necessary to hang something else with him, so that it makes it larger, for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	It is reduced or cut according to another mode: and it is as if a long wooden beam, whose head is round-shaped like the handle of a mortar, were laid on the ground. It should not be thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then soft cloths are placed upon the wooden beam after the other materials have been laid on top of it: and the standing cloth should be as long as the wooden beam.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then the hand of that person is extended to the lower part of the other side, and the body of that person is extended with strength from that side: for the joint returns to its place with ease.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If it is difficult to reduce the joint through all that I have said, then use this caution: and it should be as if you take a beam whose length is the sum of two forearms, whose width is the sum of four fingers, and whose thickness is the sum of two fingers: and its head should be round like an opening, so that the passage of its head into the deep end can be made according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied around the round head: so that it does not hurt the weak standing cloth.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then the weak standing cloth is placed under the opening, so that the hand or forearm can be extended up to the lower part of the beam: and the beam is laid on the aid, and the hand and forearm.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the forearm is placed on the step of the ladder across its breadth, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint immediately enters.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When the passage of the joint is completed according to any possible mode: then it is necessary to place a round ball of equal quantity from wool under the opening.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster made from flour with oil and almond, and spread it all over the shoulder as it rotates.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten the knot under the thin strip in a neat manner: and roll up the ligament over the plaster: and attach her hand to the neck of its own collar, and let it go, and do not make her hand move for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that a weak food be placed on him, until he recovers, because it is more beneficial for his cure.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one will be placed on him after seven days, or five, and it will be moved with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If then he holds firm and is not softened, he is already cured.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If however the joint is dislocated many times, due to the moisture that happens to him, or due to another cause: then it is necessary that this cauterization be given to him with three holes, according to what was said in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If however this is done all, and the ligament is unwound after seven days, and the joint is not confirmed, and the plaster and the knot are reapplied on it several times, and it does not hold firm, and falls away, and cannot be raised up to the upper part: then you know that the nerves of his arm which are towards the head of the shoulder are already cut, or extended, or softened: and you know that the joint is never set in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	However, dislocations of the chest and breast, or to a posterior reduction, are made with a push and extension with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining stricture and care are given with the cauterization, until it is cured.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If however it happens after his cure, old age in the member, and slowness in its movement, then a weak bath is used many times, until that old age is eased, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Translation: "On the Treatment of the Dislocation of the Knee-joint.
Caput XXVIII.	Translation: "Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Translation: "You know that a dislocation of the knee-joint is difficult to reduce and also returns with difficulty, and it itself is reduced to all parts, especially to the anterior and posterior.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	Translation: "And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it is a falling under the touch, and under the touch, according to whichever figure it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	Translation: "And when you join a dislocated knee-joint with its proper bone, this is clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	Translation: "The joint is contracted, and it cannot double the arm, nor touch its own shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	Translation: "And it is necessary to straighten it as soon as possible, and to reduce the dislocation before a hot application causes it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	Translation: "For if a hot application is given, it becomes difficult to reduce the knee-joint: and perhaps it cannot be cured at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	Translation: "For it is the worst of all kinds of dislocations, and the most severe pain that comes with them: and often it ends with death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	Translation: "And the restoration of it is, when it can be reduced, to extend the hand of the patient with two hands, and the arm of the patient be expanded, and the hand of the physician to be above the knee and under it, and he himself presses the joint with his thumbs of both hands at once, or with the root of his finger, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Translation: "Or if the dislocation is to the front, then it returns thus, that the hand doubles with its own hand, until it strikes with the root of the finger's palm of the dislocated knee-joint.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	Translation: "But if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a violent extension, with strong support: and it is that the two assistants extend the arm, and hold it even, so that it does not remove from the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is rotated around until it has been fully unfolded over the palm of the same hand, either the wide spread or the wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches it with his own hand, he should grease it with oil: so that this may be one of those which aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he will drive the joint with a strong push, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after the reduction, it should be placed on the same plaster, where the stipes and excoriation are, with the gouge: and it should be tied in a proper manner.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm is hung from the weak neck: and let it hang for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If the joint is firm in its place, then loosen the ligament from it and let it go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not well tied, then repeat the plaster, and the ligament, and let it go for some days until it is tied.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then let it go.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if, however, stiffness occurs after the reduction of the joint, and the position is in motion: then administer hydration in the bath, and subtle friction, and compression, until it becomes soft, or place it on the joint itself, that is, the pale heel of the mare.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is tied, and let it go on it for a day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it away, and introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it is wet, then friction the joint with subtle friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat on it, with one drop of ointment once, and twice, and thrice with the introduction of the bath, until it becomes soft.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	If you wish, place a damp cloth soaked in warm butter over the excrement and then tightly wrap it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	Indeed, it becomes soft again and returns to its original position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	The treatment of the dislocated Almahassem:
Caput XXIX.	Head 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The Almahassem hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the shoulder and the wrist.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	And the opposite joints are reduced.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the ease of reduction is in the reduction of this dislocation at the time it is dislocated, before the wound is closed, or else a hot apostemetic will occur.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation is such that you place the Almahassem hand of the patient on a board, and extend the other hand of his: and the physician places his palm on the prominence of the joint, and pushes it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary that it be considered if the palm has already retreated to the vent of the hand: then the physician places the weak back of his hand on the board at the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then the position of his hand intrinsically on the board is such that the hand of the physician falls on the same prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, that is good: and if not, then tightly wrap it with a sedative wound dressing: and release it, do not insist on this.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not bear, nor can you stand upon the reduction of it after three days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its twist: and nothing will hurt the weak one, unless the hand has been softened and cannot be tightened around anything: then you know that the nerves are cut or torn.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	It is not genius in her, unless it resonates with the cauterization near the site of her wound.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps she will not yield to this.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When Almahassem does not return, then place the ointment over it, which we have mentioned.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is bound, and it is released five days later: then it is dissolved and it is released, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however, the movement of her is hindered, and something of age happens to it: then soothe it with warm water and repeated rubbing, until it is soothed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	¶ Regarding the treatment of the dislocation of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from one of them to all parts, or from one of them to the back of the palm, or to its ventrum: then extend the finger, and press the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and suspend the opposite part to which it is dislocated, and release it after two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it until it is straight in that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When it is night, tie it according to the description: and do not cease to untie it in the day: and exercise it with motion: and tie it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for a few days until it is bound.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with that, if it is dislocated to the ventrum of the hand: and tie it to the same part, and do the first operation of your hand until it is cured.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with that when it is dislocated to other parts:
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	¶ Regarding the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Head 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When a spondylalgia occurs on the back or a complete dislocation of the neck, or when many vertebrae are moved from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death comes to the weak one.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the weak ones leave it without will, and cannot hold it: and often some limbs of him are made soft by it, or two thighs of him, or two arms of him, or one of them: or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For it is often removed, because it is often removed to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	And that which is removed to the back, is called gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	But the cure of it is, that you consider now, if gibbosity happens from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor any healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in those which happen by chance, or by blow, or by such like things, the ancients have already spoken of the ways of curing them with a long discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whose most does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have already abbreviated from that, whose little excuses from much of its nearness to my proximity: and from my own explanation, in which I explained it, and shaped the instrument of it in a different way from that which they showed it, and they also explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in gibbosity which happens from the front part, there is no genius, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And also in those which are made to two sides, even so.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, unless those which happen in the back properly, when I say: and it is, that the weak one extends over his face over the podium equal to the wall, and is extended under it with a wet string, so that his heart is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight log is placed on the fire on the ground, at the tip of its foot, roughly at its head: and another log, roughly at its other foot: and it is held by a servant, and it should not be fixed in the fire.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other holds the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then it is wrapped over the weak head, and the rope of its titillum is gently made firm, and extended from the end of the rope to the log that is at its head: and it is tied in it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then string another rope above its belly, and above its own knees, and at its knee joints.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ropes together and tie them in the log that is at its foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then the servant extends all of the ropes to a part of the log, and the two logs are not removed from their places where they were fixed: but they should not be made firm as I said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician will place his hands over the spine with strength, until he returns: or he may place them over the table.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he will tie the table to his feet, until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If he does not return through this treatment, then take the table whose length is roughly three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make an opening in the wall near where we said it was weak, in the place where it enters the end of the table.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the table over the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the physician will place his feet over the opposite end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tie it well, until the spine is bent, and return to its own place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	And if you wish, operate with the turn that was wrapped with your hand: and it is as if you were drawing two logs on the ground at the weak head of the other foot's last toe, and at its head two logs with the length of an arm.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	The length of the one palm tree between all timber is and already made in all places a hole, through which the turmoil runs: and the whole wood is firmly fixed on earth much, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	The round wood is inserted and there is turmoil in which the ligament rotates in two holes of two timber.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	At the end of it there is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is palm with that of which it rotates: and in two other timber is similar to this.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then strengthen the ligaments that you have tied in the weak timber which is at the head of it: and the ligaments that you have tied in the thighs of it in the timber which is at the foot of it.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand at all timber which rotates the hand of him with his sinew, with which it rotates the turmoil: and the physician should adjust the spine, according to what we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the timber which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the spine has returned and adjusted the place, then it is necessary to put the plaster of egg white with almond on it.
Deinde stuppam.	Then the stupe.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then put above the plaster a star from the tablet, whose width is three digits, or about them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And the length of it has quantity which occupies the place of Gibbositatis, and over a part of the healthy spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is placed with the ligament that we said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And it uses weak nutrition of fine, until it becomes healthy.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	What if there remains some prominence in the place at the end of the cure: then it is necessary to give medicines which soften and relax, with the administration of the tablet which we said for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	The lead sheet is now being applied in that place.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	When an exuberance occurs at the posterior spine of the vertebra, it is supposed to be a dislocation, and that is the bone that is now protruding.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore, it does not suit to make a presumption of that in this medicine, perhaps it will cause death to happen.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	¶ About the treatment of Anchaea's dislocated bone.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You know that in the joints of Anchaea and the shoulder, a dislocation only occurs, and it does not happen to them that happens in other joints due to removal of a small part and union.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the joint of Anchaea is indeed dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated towards the front and back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it is indeed most dislocated towards the inside, and little dislocated towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of the dislocation towards the inside is: because when you join the weak thigh bone with a sound one with a weak one, it is longer: and the knee of his is more prominent than the sound one, and the weak one cannot extend its foot at the groin: and it is the place that follows the groin, which is burned after being struck by the post, therefore, because the head of the hip has already become wet there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign that happens to the outside is what are its opposite symptoms, which are the opposite symptoms of these.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign that happens to the front is because the sound thigh expands according to the complement, verily it does not extend itself without pain in the knee: and if it attempts to walk, it cannot go over that to the front: and it retains its urine, and it is struck at the groin of its, and there is a callosity of its foot under the heel during walking.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of this which is subject to dislocation is towards the posterior end, so that it does not extend the knee, nor can it double itself before doubling the thigh: and the leg of its other side is shorter: and the thigh is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place of that one.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	However, reduction of this dislocation is as follows, so consider this now if the dislocation is old and has been long in place.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you perform a reduction of this, and it remains according to its position: then there is no cure at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it does not follow that it should be presumed to be completely healed.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in the one where the dislocation is recent and it is of one of the four kinds of dislocations: then you should hurry to this, so that you want to join it, and extend it both towards the interior and towards the exterior, and move it to the right and left: perhaps it will return, and there will be no need for further treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	However, if it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong attendant and extend the leg of its other side: or with his hands, or with the ligature that is placed on the leg of its above the knee: and another attendant extends his hand over the tendon of its, so that he inserts his hands under the tendon of its.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie it with a soft ligature over the root of the hip, and hold the other end of the ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And it should be extension either from the front part of the thigh to the shoulder, or from the back to the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And it should be extension of all of them in one way, until the weak one hangs down with its body from the earth, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this is the sign of the species of extension, which is common to the four kinds of dislocations.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If then the dislocation returns with that which I said, it is good: and if not, then necessary is all kind of that which I say about the cure proper.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reduction of this proper when the dislocation is to the inside, it is necessary that the weak be raised above its own sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he will put a ligament over the head of the hip, in which is the head of the hip and the place which is under the thigh.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament from the part of the thigh up to the higher part of the body, to the knee.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then he will take another helper to the strong arm of his, and he will make the weak place of the poor hip less, and he will extend it with a strong extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now then it returns to its own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this species is easier than the others in the cure of this member.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If however he is excused from you, and does not obey to the coming with this kind of cure altogether: then it is necessary that two weak feet be tied together with a strong and soft ligament over two heels, and over two knees: and the length of each should be according to the quantity of four digits of his own: and the weak knee should be extended more than the other quantity of two digits.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then he will hang the weak over the head of the wooden beam which is in the house: and the length of it should be according to the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then let the strong ivy cover the head of the hip: and he will hang with the weak in another place: and he will press the strong one to cover the hip with strength, for the dislocation returns to its own place with feebleness.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In the reduction of this proper when the dislocation is to the outside, it is necessary that the weak lie on the foot according to what we have said about the hunchback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	The ligament is tied above his thigh, the weakest part properly, and above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two beams are placed, one at his foot, and another at the head of the same.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a beam is placed in the middle of his foot, fixed well: above which the wet bands are wrapped, so as not to harm the weak one; and it should be a beam between his thighs, so as not to attract the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the assistants extend to their own part, and the physician makes the reduction with his own hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If then he obeys for reunion, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place over the same tablet, and press it down evenly, as we said in the swelling.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that the weak one lie on his sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the weak leg be extended quickly: and this is according to the same narration over the foot: and the physician places his right hand palm on the weak thigh.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he bends it with one hand and places the extended leg down to the lower part of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the weak leg be extended downwards and be raised on the ground, but it should be placed on a hard surface, as it is necessary that it also be placed if the dislocation is far away from his exterior, according to what we said about his pillow over two anchas: and it should be on his face and the extended ligaments: according to what we said earlier.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be given with the table also over the place where he is going to be united, when the reduction is complete according to what is appropriate.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	When the sign of its ransom is revealed to you, and it is that you extend two weak legs: and when you see them equal, and the weak one tightens its own thigh, and expands it without exception: then you know that the limb has returned, according to what is appropriate: then join the two buttocks, and put on plaster, and tie with a rope, as if it were a wheel: so that it does not swell to any part: and it will hold firmly by quiet for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then solve the ligament, and the plaster, and compare the thigh with the other: then if you see them equal in state, then you know that the dislocation is already fixed: therefore, loosen the weak one for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see something of softening: then return, and that plaster, and tie it according to your first stricture: and release it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then solve that and make it slow in walking over both for a few days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	¶ Regarding the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	The knee is dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and to the lower part, that is, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	The sign of its dislocation is that it extends the weak leg, so that it applies its thigh to its own buttock.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	However, if it does not hold with the buttock: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is that you make the weak leg sit straight, so that it can extend its thigh if possible over there, and hold your back to its face: and place its foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then hold on with your thumbs to its knee, and make straight lines over its knee with your fingers.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your hand's side two sides of its knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another one extends its foot, until it returns its knee to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of return is that it holds on with the knee to the thigh without labor.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply the plaster itself, and hold on the knee with the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind it together for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then release it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And do not use it for weak walking for a few days until it heals.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	However, if it refuses your return, then administer a strong extension with the bands that precede the report in the care of Anchaea, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	¶ Treatment of Calcaneal Dislocation.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel sometimes comes off by gentle removal and sometimes it is dislocated according to the complement.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation is made, either to the inside or outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel inflated, going to the part where it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	However, the treatment of its removal is a easy return: and it is that it extends with ease with the hands and becomes equal until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of it when it is dislocated according to the complement, it is necessary that you make the weak sit upright: and hold it with a strong hand from the back part of its back, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold on with your right hand's foot of its part from the top of it and with your left hand's foot from the bottom part of its foot's place.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull your foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left hand, make two incisions.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with your left hand, and push the chest of the foot with your right leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the chest of the foot towards the third thigh, and you will pull out the catheter.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If then it returns to the third thigh, or to two in this manner, and you see the foot equalized, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on this one, because it returns itself.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however, it is forbidden for you to return it with what we have described: then make the weak side lie on its back over the ground, and fasten a bandage on the firm ground, so that it falls between its thighs: and you will have already covered it with the cloth, so that it does not hurt the weak one.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the attendant take the thigh of his patient: then extend the other foot, either with his hands, or with the bandage that lies on the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let the attendant extend all against the comparison of his extension: and let the bandage stand between the two weak thighs, holding it, so that it does not attract the body of its towards the lower parts in the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician should straighten the dislocation with his hands, and the other attendant should hold the sound thigh down to the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with weakness.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When then the dislocation returns, and it declares to you the health of its return: then put on the plaster and ointment, and tie it firmly with the strong bandages, and tie the foot with the bandage to the thigh.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.

Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.
