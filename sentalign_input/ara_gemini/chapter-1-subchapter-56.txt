Chapter fifty-six on cauterizing bleeding occurring when an artery is severed.
Bleeding often occurs from an artery that has been severed during an external wound, or when incising a tumor, or cauterizing an organ, and so on, making it difficult to stop.
So if this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger over the opening of the artery and press firmly until the blood is trapped beneath your finger and nothing comes out.
Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large depending on the wound and the place where the artery ruptured, and apply the cautery to the vessel itself after quickly removing your finger, holding the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If the blood gushes out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire, and continue doing this one after another until the bleeding stops, taking care not to burn a nerve that might be there, thus causing the patient further harm.
Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization as we have said, or by severing it if it has not already been severed, for if it is severed, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop, or by tying it tightly with threads, or by applying medications that stop bleeding and applying tight bandages.
As for those who try to stop it with a bandage, or by tightening it with rags, or by applying burning substances, and so on, it will not stop at all by that, except rarely.
If this happens to someone and there is no doctor or medicine present, he should immediately place his index finger over the opening of the wound itself, as we have described, and press very firmly until the blood is contained and comes out from above the wound, and he should continually apply very cold water to the artery and finger, without removing it, until the blood clots, thickens, and stops flowing.
Meanwhile, consider what cauterization or medication he needs.
