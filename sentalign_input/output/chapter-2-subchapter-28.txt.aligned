On the incision of flesh attached to the gums.	On the excision of superfluous growths on the gum.	0.6114721
Often, flesh attached to the gum grows, which the ancients called albulus, then you must suspend it with a nail or hold it with forceps and cut it down to its root, and let the pus or blood flow.	There often grows on the gum superfluous flesh which the Ancients call 'epulis'. You should take it up with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its root and let the pus or blood flow out.	0.76503396
And then place on the site pounded sage or other astringent or drying powders.	Then put on the place either pounded vitriol or one of the absorbent styptic powders.	0.70713896
And if that flesh returns, then cut it again, and cauterize it, because after the cautery it will not return.	And if the growth returns after treatment—for they often return—excise a second time and cauterize; it will not come back after cauterization.	0.7270225
