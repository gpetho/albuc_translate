This book is completed for you, O sons, who are the science of medicine in its entirety and have reached its clarification and explanation. I consider it complete among you with this treatise which is a part of the manual work by hand.
The manual work by hand is excellent in our country and in our time, as the art of surgery has been unknown until it started to be studied and its effect was perceived. Remains of it are easy to find in the old books, which were drawn with hands and mistakenly depicted, until its meaning was clarified and its benefits became evident.
I consider it appropriate to revive and elaborate on this treatise through explanation, clarification, and conciseness, and provide illustrations of the various instruments and tools used in surgery as it adds to the clarity and is necessary for those who need it.
The reason there is no skilled craftsman in our time is because the art of medicine takes a long time, and it is necessary for its practitioner to have knowledge of surgical dissection as described by Galenus. The practitioner must know the benefits and functions of the body parts, their connections and disconnections, the bones, joints, muscles, number, exits, the arteries and veins, and locations of the exits, as well as nerves and tendons, and their origins.
Physicians are named in great numbers but few in deed, and not at all skilled in the craft of surgery. We have mentioned some of them in the introduction to this book.
Whoever is not skilled in what we have mentioned concerning dissection, it is not possible for him to avoid committing an error that may cause the death of people, as you have often seen with those who practice this art without knowledge or expertise.
That is why you have seen an ignorant physician, who has dissected a monkey's vein in the woman's neck, mistaking it for one of the veins of the neck, causing the woman's blood to flow out until she died between his hands.
You have seen another physician who was trying to remove a stone that had caused pain in a man's bladder, but the stone was large and broke apart upon being removed with a piece of flint. The man died after about three days, and I had called for its removal, but you saw the bone of the stone and the swelling that was too difficult to remove.
You have seen another physician who lived by the side of some rulers in our country on account of medicine.
A blacksmith named Sabbah had a fracture near his elbow joint with an injury. The physician, in his ignorance, hastily set the fracture onto the wound, and tightly bound it securely so that the injury did not breathe.
Then he let him indulge in his desires, then left him for days and ordered him not to remove the bandages until his arm became numb and swollen, causing it to rot.
He called him and hastily removed the bandages, finding relief and regaining control over his condition, but corruption had already ruled over the limb and it could not be healed.
The corruption continued to progress in the limb until it perished.
A later physician saw it, a blistering, cancerous lesion, and treated it after several days until the bone was visible on the patient's arm. However, it is not advisable to use iron cauterization when cancer is mixed with other pigments.
Except that it might affect the whole limb.
And for this, my sons, it is necessary that you learn that work with hands can be divided into two types: a safe work and a painful one, which is often the case.
"You must be cautious in every place where this book suggests work that causes fear and alarm. It is important for you to be warned of it and refuse it.
"Lest the ignorant person find a path to slander and abuse, take precautions for yourselves with garments and armor, and treat your patients with compassion and steadfastness.
"Make use of the best path leading to safety and praiseworthy outcome, and diagnose dangerous and difficult illnesses with caution.
"Be cautious about what you fear may deceive you in your religion and worldly life, for it will remain with the ignorant and elevate them in this world and the hereafter according to your abilities.
"Galen has said in some of his admonitions, 'Do not treat a bad disease so as to be called a bad physician.'
"This article has been divided into three sections.
"Chapter One
"In the first chapter: The methods of cauterization with fire and the application of sharp scalpel from the neck to the foot, including images of tools and all that is needed for work by hand.
"Chapter Two
"In the second chapter: Fractures, dislocations, traction, suturing, surgeries, extraction of foreign bodies and related topics, each with a specific order and images of tools.
The Third Chapter.
Chapter on Algebra, amputation, treatment of fistula and related topics in order from head to foot along with images of tools.
First Chapter.
On the Eye.
Before describing the work with it, it is necessary to mention its advantages and disadvantages and in what constitution it is used.
I say that the discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of the eye is a long, precise, hidden science, and many wise men have spoken about it.
They differed in it and I have summarized their words to avoid prolongation.
I say that the eye is beneficial in general for all bad constitutions, whether with or without matter, and these are the hot dry constitution and the cold dry constitution.
As for the cold moist constitution with matter, they differed in it. Some said that the eye is beneficial in it and others denied it by saying that the eye does not help in a disease that is hot and wet because the nature of fire is hot and wet.
It is also inappropriate to treat a hot and cold disease with a warm dry eye, and the one who says otherwise states that the eye can help with a hot and cold disease occurring in human bodies. When you have placed the human body and moistened it with a fire mixture, cauterize the human body with cold.
And I say, according to his saying, that experience has proven this matter on many occasions except that it should not be imagined without thorough training in the art of surgery. Differences in the constitution of people, conditions of diseases within themselves, their causes and symptoms, as well as the duration of their time.
As for other humors, there is no fear from them and cold and damp diseases have been agreed upon by all doctors and they do not differ in the benefit of cauterization in them.
And know, oh sons, that the secret of treatment by fire and its superiority over medicines that burn is that fire is pure without admixture, it does not harm the part it penetrates nor damage any other part connected to it except for a mild damage.
The medicine that burns may penetrate to what follows the organs and perhaps create diseases in the part, narrow its passages or even kill, but for the excellence and dignity of fire, it does not do this except by excessive use.
It has become clear to us through experimentation, for the duration of service and care in craftsmanship, by adhering to the facts of the matter.
For this, I have chosen to abstain from lengthy discourse; if it were not inappropriate for this book, I would explain for you the secret of fire in the bodies and how to perform it in the limbs and eliminate diseases through philosophical reasoning that will make the understanding clear.
Know, oh sons, that they have differed in the time when it is suitable for the cupping and considered the best time as spring.
I say that cupping can be performed at any time, as the harm caused before the time has a long period of benefit brought by cupping. Indeed, it is not advisable to delay cupping for serious diseases of great intensity, as the danger inside from the time before outweighs the easier harm from the delay.
Do not be deceived, oh sons, by what the common people and the ignorance of doctors believe, that cupping is a treatment for a disease, which is not its purpose but rather a repetition that becomes binding.
The substance K is not what you think, it only serves to alter the humor and dry up the humors that are the cause of wounds.
The K substance is superior to the medicine in quickness of effect, power of action and intensity of control.
The illness may return at times according to the nature of the causative factor, and it is possible for the illness to persist and grow within the body due to the accumulation of humors in it and preoccupation with acquiring nourishment and similar factors.
O Allah, let the illness that uses the K be a gentle illness in a small organ and in a body with little humors and moisture. The K substance, such as the extraction of a tooth and similar things, it is possible that this illness will not return in it and it will be in the least possible amount.
And concerning the common saying that K is the last resort of medicine, this is correct to the extent that they mean that there is no cure by any medicine or anything else after it and the application of K and the contrary method.
The meaning of "K is the last resort of medicine" is that we use all methods of treatment for a disease and these medications do not work, then we use K and it works, from here K became the last resort. Meaningless is what the common people and many physicians have attributed to it.
Gold is better than iron in its properties, and they have said this due to the refinement of gold and the nobility of its essence; it does not corrode and that is not generally applicable.
I have found that it only works in some organs, not all; gold is better and superior to iron as they have said; if you protect a vessel made of gold in fire, it will not indicate to you the strength of protection you desire for the redness of gold.
It is faster to cool and if you increase the heating in it in fire, it collapses; therefore, among us, iron is quicker and closer to being suitable for use, if God wills.
This chapter on the vein has been organized from head to foot to make it easier for the student, if God wills.
The First Chapter.
In the head, there is one vein.
This vein helps in alleviating excessive moisture and coldness on the brain, which are causes of headaches, frequent nosebleeds from the nostrils and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and ear pain. Each disease that exhibits symptoms of inflammation includes phlegmon, abscess, fistula, and similar diseases.
This image instructs the surgeon first to perform a cleansing with an easy-to-administer drug for the head, for three or four nights according to the strength and custom of the patient.
Then, he is ordered to shave his head with scissors, then he sits between your hands with his hands on his chest.
Then, place the palm of your hand on his throat between his eyes, when you reach the middle finger, inform him of that position by nodding.
Then, apply the olive oil container shown in this image.
Expose from the bone the size of a nut or of a walnut, then raise your hand and prepare it with iron (or something else if it is hot). Continue to see from the bone what you have mentioned, then take some salt and put it in water and drink a small amount of it, place it on the position and leave it for three days.
Then, apply a drinkable poultice made of oil and leave it on him until the burn goes away, then treat him with a four-finger-thick dressing until he recovers (if God wills).
The wound, as long as it remains open, allows the purulent matter to drain, and it is best and beneficial.
Some of them mentioned that the skin should be sutured to the bone and the suture kept until some part of the marrow of the bone is burned, then the charred part of the bone is removed afterward and treatment is administered.
Others stated that the scalpel should be used until it affects the bone strongly, causing a piece of bone to fall out like a chip or small pellet. They claimed that pus drains from this location and the wound should remain open for a long period of time.
Then it is treated until healed, and I do not see any benefit in these types of incisions except for some people and along the path of cauterization, leaving them behind is better and safer if there is no natural connection as we have seen in other body parts.
It is not suitable when the head of the ulna (the lower arm bone) is weak by nature, and the first type of incision is more favorable for me and I prefer to use it if desired, God willing.
The second chapter.
In the head (skull) as well.
If a boil occurs in the head and it is long-lasting despite the use of leeches, cupping glasses, bloodletting, lancing, and cauterization, and if it seems that the single incision we described has not benefited, look again. If the patient's head is robust in structure and not weak, and he finds a severe headache, make another incision slightly above that. Then, make an incision on each ridge of his head until the skin blisters and the bone cyst that we described is revealed. Make an incision at the back of his head, in the place known as the 'fossa', and press lightly on it so that the bone is not exposed. The patient will find severe pain in this incision compared to all other incisions in the head, and I shall mark this incision in its place.
The incision that is to be made on the ridge and at the back of the head should be shallower than the one made in the center of the head, and this is its appearance.
Third Chapter.
On unhealed fractures.
If a pain with swelling occurs in the skull fracture and extends to the eye, let the patient take medicines for the head, and apply all the treatments mentioned in the section on diseases. If this does not help, make an incision in it on two sides. It may be with sharp burning drugs, or it may be with iron.
If with sharp burning drugs, it is to take one clove of garlic, grind it and cut its sides from both sides, then pierce the wound location with a wide probe until there is space in it that accommodates the clove.
It is inserted under the skin until it disappears, then press firmly with a strong bandage and leave it for ten hours, then remove it and take out the garlic clove. Leave the wound for two or three days before dressing again.
Cover it with a salve made of oil until the wound heals, then treat it with linseed oil until it cures by God's will. If you wish, perform this treatment using some of the burning drugs mentioned in chapter 14 on burning drugs.
If with iron, this is its nature: the instrument shown in the following image is to be heated until red hot...
The instrument called the iron screw is so named because its tip resembles a nail, and there is a small notch in its center.
Then place it on the wound and hold it with one hand while you slowly heat the iron slightly, until the skin around the wound is red and hot like half of its thickness. Lift your hand so as not to burn the nostrils that are below, causing a nosebleed. Then drink some castor oil in salt water and place it on the spot and leave it for three days. Then, carry the castor oil and treat it with turpentine until it heals, if God wills.
And if you wish, tie this small pouch with a thin silk thread from the pot and keep the nostrils in it except when eating or drinking.
Chapter Four.
For the pouch with a bandage.
If the pouch treatment we have mentioned does not heal and you find that the medicine or fire does not work as described in the list of diseases, try another method by using a milder drug or a different treatment with water. It is necessary to tie the silk pouch until it turns white after learning its location with a line as long as half a finger or approximately, and leave your hand for one time and then press it until you cut the nostrils and reach the bone.
It is necessary for you to keep away from the joint that moves near the jaw, as it may cause burning of the nerves or muscles that move it and result in numbness.
Beware and be on guard from the spurting of arterial blood that you have severed, for there is danger in it. Certainly, for the one ignorant of what he is doing and has not been an experienced practitioner, it is best to leave work in the hands of another.
The guidance for managing the spurting of arterial blood from the arm will be found in its place in this book, if God wills it. If you find that this method does not suit the case, then do not use it.
If you find the body of the patient to be fragile, treat it gently as we have described and care for the wound until he recovers, if God wills it.
If you wish, use the method we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterizing arteries with iron rods. It is a better and more effective method than this one.
Fifth section.
On injuries to the ears.
If a wound occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with soft substances and all the remedies mentioned in the classification, but the wound does not heal, then apply the iron rod named "the point," as shown in this picture.
Then, after heating it, apply the iron rod to the entire ear as it rotates, or to both ears if the wound is in either one. Translate: Move a little distance from the base of the ear, learn its position with the goniometer and let the incision be about ten points in each ear or approximately so, then treat the locations until he recovers, God willing.
Translate: Chapter Six.
Translate: On Incision of Ligature.
Translate: The ligature to be incised is of the type that occurs due to the disease as mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
Translate: Avoid incising the type that occurs from stridor and paralysis of the nerves.
Translate: When this type of ligature is treated with irrigations, drains and clysters but there was no improvement, it is necessary to find the cause with three incisions. Translate: One is at the base of the ear, the second one slightly below its opening, and the third one at the meeting of the eyes.
Translate: Make the incision on the affected side as the edema only occurs on the apparent healthy side.
Translate: The shape of the incision should be a keyhole-like incision facing the upper part of the ear below the temple slightly, and another in the earlobe with its length similar to the thickness of the ear lobe.
Bring your finger down until it burns half an inch of the skin, and this is the image of a cauterizer, which is a type of scalpel, its representation is only slightly softer than it appears. The blade of the scalpel should have a slight sharpness, then treat the area as described until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Seven.
On cauterizing wounds in the genitals.
If the genitals are cauterized and treated as we have described, but the treatment does not work and there is no obvious cause, then burn four times. On every quarter of the head, burn a spot and another in the center as we have described, then burn a spot on the base of the head according to what is required.
The description of the cauterizer is as follows, and a spot may also be burned on the mouth of the wound, if necessary, then treat accordingly.
Chapter Eight.
On the topic of anemia.
The one who is suffering from anemia should be given nourishing drinks, such as barley water and wheat porridge first.
Then, his head is shaved completely and a plaster made from ground walnuts (as described in the article on swelling) is applied to the base of the skull, as this will help with recovery.
Perform it on the location as described earlier, for if there is bleeding with that and not otherwise, three small incisions will be found on the top of the head extending from the top of the skull to the neck.
Between each incision, make a nail prick and then treat the wound as directed, for if you wish to increase [the number of incisions] and the reason is plausible, perform it on the central incision.
If you wish to increase [the number of incisions], perform them on the horns and treat them until they bleed, and the cup will be filled with oil as shown in the image provided.
Section Nine.
Infiltrate the vagina and dilate all the body (cavities).
It is necessary to clean the head with irrigations and as mentioned earlier, then cut off the forehead of the patient, make an incision in the middle of the head and an incision on each horn of the head and another one at the back of the head.
Make three incisions on the neck veins, for if it is necessary to dilate the body more than this and the patient is likely to require that and the disease is severe and well-controlled, make four incisions on the chest veins of the patient. "Reach with the cautery until the skin is burnt most, then lift your hand and treat it as it presents itself until it heals if Allah wills, and the blister should be bladder-like.
"Chapter Ten:
"On making an incision.
"The incision that is made before the boil, it should first be cleaned with large yarrows and all the treatments mentioned earlier in the section if the cause is severe and it is likely to take medication.
"If it is a child who cannot take medication, do not use lance and cauterizing iron for the boil before that for many days with improving diet.
"Then shave his head, and make a single incision in the center of the head according to what is presented, and another incision later. "On each quarter of his head, make an incision, if the patient is strong and it is likely, make the incisions as mentioned in the 'owner of the abscess' and bind the body with belts on the neck and back, and the blister should be bladder-like according to what presents.
If the patient is a child, make the incision gentle on this shape.
If the vein is thin and delicate, then use a small needle and thread with a knot at the end. Pass the needle under the skin near the vein, keeping it parallel to the vein until you reach its other end, then tie the knot and pull the thread firmly to prevent any leakage of blood.
In case of fractured mandible.
If the reason for mandible fracture is putrefactive pus and abscess has become hard, apply the keys mentioned in the owner of the falx (spatula).
If the reason for mandible fracture is an injury close to becoming black and the body of the injured person is swollen, treat it with whatever cleans the brain on what comes in dissection.
Then cut off the head of the injured person, then make a firm round cake from walnut like a circle and place it in the middle of his head and hold him upright with both hands, then take a rod and one from raw sheep fat.
Then heat it on the fire until a degree that finger can tolerate if it is inserted, then break it and place its middle in the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this to the injured person every week with other treatments for as long as he wishes, God willing.
If you wish, pierce it with many small holes except that your hand holds the handle, but it becomes fragrant. This type of fracture makes the brain swell to a certain extent.
Then place a damp cloth on it or in chicken fat.
Chapter Ten.
On the matter of water flowing in the eye.
If it is apparent to you that water flows in the eye with the signs mentioned in the section, then immediately apply the remedy mentioned therein: Wash the affected area and surrounding skin thoroughly with all moisture and rinse it in hot water in a steam bath for several days.
Then make an incision on the head, at the center, then make two additional incisions on each eyelid if water is flowing from both eyes or only one eye is affected.
Then cut all the vessels and cilia found under the skin, so that the incisions are as long as the eyelids and avoid bleeding.
If you see something, cut it at the location with any treatment you can, and wisdom will come to you in dealing with the cilia and cutting them, avoiding bleeding.
There are two large cavities under the eye bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On tear ducts.
If the tear ducts of the eyes are constantly blocked and previously affected by cilia and vessels on the surface of the head outside the head, and you believe that this is due to hard cold growths, cut the incision described in the section for water flowing in the eye. A cavity in the middle of the head, two cavities on the temples, and two more beneath the eyes under the bone; if it requires more, make a cavity on each side of the eyebrow's edge with a small cup.
The fourth section is titled "The Fourth Section.
In the cavities of the nostrils.
If treated as we have described in the previous section and the treatment does not work, then apply the cautery three times for three nights; then, cut off his head and scoop out the cavity in the middle with a small olive oil cup. Then, scoop out with a small metallic cup two times under the eyebrows, near the hair but not cut off the ends (of the hairs); and preserve them. This is an image of the metallic cup.
The fifth section is titled "The Fifth Section.
In the cavity of the eyelid socket.
If the eyelid socket swells due to a disease or water retention, then scoop it out with one cup using this crescent-shaped cup.
And if you wish, scoop out a little under the eyebrows on both sides, in each direction; keep a distance from the temples, and let each cup be as long as the eyebrow.
Do not cut deep with your hand, but only up to the point of burning a third of the skin, and let the knife's impression be as described.
Chapter Sixteen.
On Blepharotomy (Eye Lid Surgery).
If the incision is turned inside, the eye will bulge and the knife should be in two types therein. Either the knife is heated with fire or with a burning drug, so if it is heated with fire, the patient should be ordered to keep his eyes open wide until they stretch and level before the incision.
If it is incised during sleep, the eyes will swell and become immobile until they subside, when they have subsided and are level, place the patient's head on a stone, then mark the eyelid with a sign in the shape of an 'as'.
The beginning of the sign should be near the incision, then place a piece of cotton soaked in white milk or blue tincture under the eyelid, and cover this cut with a piece of linen cloth.
Then cover it little by little in many repetitions until the skin surface that resembles the 'as' sign is completely visible and obvious, and this indicates the success of your work as you see the eyelid swell and the hair rise above the eye meat.
Lift your hand when required, then leave it for three days, then apply a linen cloth with oil until the dryness disappears, then treat it with alum until it heals, if Allah wills, provided that hair does not grow back afterwards and the wound is closed.
Prepare the lesion in the same manner as before, if there is hair in the lower eyelid, remove it until it returns to its natural position and no new hair grows in the eye area. As for cauterization with burning medicine, it is to instruct the patient to leave the sores open until they grow and level out.
Then make a shape from the wax and paper, take from the sacred soap and unslaked lime from each of them weighing a dirham or approximately that, squeeze both together firmly, do this with a grinder to prevent it from hardening. Then, spread it on the lesion that you have prepared in a specific shape and paper form, place it on one or both eyes and place a damp cloth soaked in egg white under the eye and place the patient's head on the stone.
Place your thumb on the medicine and hold it slightly, moving it when the patient feels the heat of the medicine as it is like fire, if the heat persists, leave the medicine in place and move it with your thumb. If the heat ceases, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
If you see the nose lifted as it does when burned or cut, otherwise prepare a medicine for it at the spot where the medicine has not affected and has not blackened until your work is complete and the eye is healed, then put cotton dipped in oil on it until the burn heals.
Then treat it with oil of almond or something similar until it heals, it is necessary that during the treatment nothing from the medicine falls into the eye. If the nose bleeds after days and hair appears in the eye, something fell into the eye.
Prepare the medicine specifically for that spot from where the nose was bleeding, as you did first, then treat it until it heals. This is a picture of an ox hide.
Know that human eyes differ in size and smallness, so adapt your cauterization accordingly, and it is not hidden that the method of healing is clear for those who have a skill in this craft.
The seventh chapter.
On the nasal bone that is exposed in the orbit of the eye.
If the nose is treated as we have described in the treatments for diseases, but your treatment does not succeed, it is necessary to adapt to this characteristic.
The Al-Ail commands that you place his head on your stone and hold it with your servant between your hands so he does not move or shake his head.
Then put a swollen cotton in the white of the egg or in the lice ointment on his eye, then cover the bottle which is its shape.
This should be in the shape of a bird's beak from one side, which has the kaii, and if you wish, it may be open from the other side, or it could be sealed like the murod (an object used for medical purposes). However, this form is better for your work, if God wills.
Then grind the naswar (a type of resin) if it is open and extract its oil or if it is not open, you shall open it and extract its qayh (residue). Afterwards, place the bottle on it, which is very tight, and hold it with your hand until you reach the bone.
Move your hand slightly away from the kaii towards the nose side so as not to make a mistake or cause distress to the patient, for fear that the bottle will fall into the eye socket and damage it. If you have reached the bone in the first attempt, otherwise, prepare another bottle if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a lint soaked in oil on it and treat it with dry mash (marrow) until it bursts open. If it has not burst open within forty days, apply the sharp purgative medicine to make the bone appear and revive whatever is inside as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
The last face of a Nasir (a type of wound or injury) is mentioned among some of its initial symptoms, the person proceeds to the location of the Nasir and opens it, then places fine sand on it in this form (shown in the image).
Pour into it a container of one dirham of mercury mixed with vinegar, grasp the sand firmly and well greased, so that the small fly does not move and thus prevent the mercury from entering its eye. Place cotton soaked in milk or water on the fly's eye.
If the mercury burns the Nasir and bursts it open in an unusual way, then the Nasir is healed according to what we have mentioned of the symptoms and treatment, otherwise there is no alternative but to make a hole in the neck and guide the Nasir to the nasal passage as will be explained in its specific context.
Chapter 14.
In fractures of the eyelid.
In the fractures of the eyelid, commonly known as 'shu'ra', especially in children, it happens quite often. If this fracture is treated as we have described in our classification, the treatment may not be effective. Therefore, make a small, sharp-pointed incision on this figure (as shown).
The cavity should be made along the blade of the scalpel, then place a small forceps inside the same fracture until it reaches the depth of the fracture, and then treat it with quirories (instruments for bone setting) until it heals, if Allah wills.
The Ninth Chapter.
In the fractures of the nasal bones in the mouth.
If it occurs in the socket, gum or root of the tooth and then swells and breaks and becomes a pus-filled nasal bone fracture, but treatment does not work, it is necessary to make an incision over the nasal bones up to their size.
Then insert a forceps into the nasal bone socket and hold it until the forceps with the protected iron reaches the front and back walls, and repeat this process once or twice, then treat it as we have described in our treatment until it heals, if Allah wills.
If a limb is severed and the flesh exits, otherwise it is necessary to examine the location and remove the rotten bone as appropriate, if Allah wills.
Chapter Ten.
On fractures and dislocations that require reduction.
If a dislocation occurs due to moisture and the limb moves, it is treated with medications but does not heal. Then, place the head of the hammer in the socket and apply the forceps that match its shape after placing the tube on the fracture.
Enter the socket with a hammer and hold it slightly until you feel the hammerhead reach the fracture site, then lift your hand and return the hammer multiple times as desired, then the bone will be filled with salt water.
Hold it for an hour and strike with it; the moving fracture will settle, and the dislocated limb will tighten and the rotten moisture will dry up.
Chapter One and Ten.
On the pain of a fracture.
If the fracture pain is due to cold or there is pus in it and the treatment with medication has not healed, then apply heat to it on both sides either by using oil or fire.
As for the cupping with lard, it is to take mutton fat, heat it in an iron basin or bowl, then take a leather cup, burn its edge on the rim of the vessel, immerse it in the heated lard, place it on the affected vein with a wheel and hold it until it cools.
Then return it several times until the heat of fire reaches the root of the vein, and if you wish, immerse a thread or leather in cold lard and place it on the affected vein and cover it with a protective iron cup until the heat reaches the vein's cavity.
And as for cauterizing with fire, it is to go to a copper or iron tube and there should be a small amount of pitch inside so that the heat of fire does not reach the patient's mouth, then heat the vessel that resembles its shape and place it on the same vein and hold it until the vessel cools, do this several times.
The pain may depart either immediately or after some time, and in the event of cupping it is advisable for the patient to fill his mouth with good lard and hold it for an hour then apply it, as shown in this vessel's image.
"Place it [the catheter] on whichever side you wish, and as much as possible, and this is an image of the bladder.
"The second and fortieth section
"In what kinds of skins
"If the skins are from animals that are cold and moist, and they do not react to medications, and you wish to have a quick hardening, then soak the cannula, which is this image of its outlet on both sides.
"When the gas comes out from the other side, place it [the cannula] covered on the same worm two times if necessary until you reach the depth of the worm. If the worm is small, make the cannula in accordance with the size of the worm.
"Then leave it for three days and apply a greased bandage on it. Let what has been burned by fire go away, then treat it with mercury and sulfur until it heals (God willing).
"The third and fortieth section
"In the case of hearing disorders and difficulty breathing.
"If moisture accumulates in the skull and it is accompanied by seizures, it is necessary to empty the cyst first with easy medications, then place a cannula at the base of the hole in the lowest position.
Warning: Do not reach the vein with the scalpel, and do not burn from the skin except half of it. Then tie another suture at the neck's end, in the last part of its incision, and let the ligature be spiral on the side advancing.
Then treat it as described until he recovers, God willing.
The fourth and fortieth chapter.
In the case of headache and pain.
If the pain and headache are due to cold wetness without any poison or heat, and if the disease is severe, tie two sutures above the temples in the light, empty places, and another one in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The ligature should be spiral as shown in the diagram, and if you wish, make it like a knot using the point called "al-naqtsa," and its diagram has been shown in the section on treating ear pain, and the points are about thirty to this effect.
Then treat it as described until he recovers, and you can make a ligature with three strands as shown in this diagram, and you should use it once to tie three sutures, and this is the image of the ligature.
The fifth and tenth chapters.
On removing pus.
If the head of a limb emerges due to suppuration or has not been set at the time it was returned, it should be allowed to do so regularly until that becomes customary, then it should be extracted when it makes the smallest movement as we have observed in our practice. It is necessary to apply traction on the bone first. Then the vein rises on his back or the correct side, then lift the skin that is inside the abdomen with your left hand fingers if the division is made, it will protrude into the abdomen.
Then seal the vessel with the two stitches, these are its images.
Then sew the skin to it until it is brought to the other side and becomes a square shape with four corners, and it may be sewn with a vessel having three stitches; at that time its shape will be six corners, and the stitches will be on the edge of the wound.
These are the images of the vessels with three stitches.
And it may increase by one, so the corners will be eight, then place a soft cataplasm with salt on the wound, and make the patient fast until he recovers, and if the division is above and it should be done.
Cover the incision with a single thick suture or many thin ones; if the division is made, it will tighten and the moisture will disappear and the wound will dry up for the patient.
The sixth and tenth sections.
In the case of an inguinal hernia.
If fever and excessive sweating occur in the body, even if it exits from its natural course and an increase of discharges occurs towards it, and it is not cured by treatment, then it is necessary to apply leeches on his back and make him drink and use his hands. Then, tie three cupping glasses. The cup should be placed under the scapula with the size of a finger, and two cups below the sides of one cup until the shape of the cups resemble a triangle and are separated from each other to avoid collapsing. The depth of the cups should be a third of the thickness of the skin, and the shape of the cups should resemble a triangle.
On this image, and according to these dimensions, nothing more.
If you wish to tie one large cup in the middle of the body on this image.
The cup that is tied to this single cup should be in the shape of a circle on this image.
The body can be cupped for bleeding from this cup and it is to learn on the body a point according to the desired size, then tie a puncture cup, then treat with the treatment you provide until it breaks.
Chapter Seven and Forty.
On cold abdomens.
If [the patient] shows symptoms of abdominal pain arising from cold, dampness or foul-smelling gas until his natural condition has been disrupted with an uncontrolled and sudden expulsion, but this does not result in improvement as described in the classification, then... It is necessary for the attendant to place his hand on the patient's abdomen, below the navel where the human appendix ends, and learn three [pressure] techniques in this manner and of this size directly on the abdomen.
And after each technique, the fingertip should be pressed firmly and the length of the hand should be kept straight without bending the fingers.
The amount of heat required should be no more than half the thickness of the skin, and the attendant should stand on his toes if he is standing, otherwise he should sit with his feet flat on the ground; this is the position of the hand.
You can perform these techniques using the cupping glass, if you have an assistant to help and skillful in the craft, and be careful not to burn the skin completely as it will burn the abdomen and reach the organs; know that the skin is thin there.
The eighth and fortieth chapter.
In punctured and cut abdomen by cauterization.
If a boil appears in the abdomen and you want to know whether it is in the liver muscle or its membrane, if it is in the liver muscle, then the cause is heaviness and pain without severity.
And if it is in the membrane of the abdomen, with pain that is severe and you think that the physicians have found a treatment for it, then the cause must be applied to its base and you should learn the method of cauterization at the location of the boil.
Then, heat the iron [tool] in the fire and this is its shape. And carve it with one cut until the skin is burned completely and it reaches the membrane, so that all pus is released, then treat it as for abscesses until it heals.
This type of boil should not be used except by one who has practiced it extensively in medicine and has experienced these diseases many times, then he can proceed with such work and leave it with the best of abilities.
The ninth and fortieth chapter.
In cases of dislocation (of bones).
Describing the earliest methods for cold dislocation, from al-Zahrāwī, it is to take a long, straight yaw bone (phalanx), then immerse it in oil and heat it in fire. Then, a single knot is made between the neck of the bone and another smaller one without tendons nearby at the side towards the flesh, and two large ones above the shoulder blades between the third and fourth joints.
And two more in between the fifth and sixth joints, near the back, and another in the middle of the chest and one above the breastbone, with three knots from behind and one between the arms and two below the ribs on either side of the dislocated bone (phalanx).
It is not appropriate to insert your hand into the knot, but it should be on the surface of the skin with a covering. Some early methods mention that some people used a metal tube resembling a millet (a unit of measure) for protection and inserted it between the dislocated joints until it reaches the same joint.
The abscess comes out as we have mentioned in the abdomen, and in this type of boil, it may happen that the patient dies from his hour or that he exposes himself to surgeons without any hesitation.
Chapter Thirty.
On scrofula (tuberculosis of the lymph nodes).
If you treat scrofula as we have mentioned in the cutting section, your treatment will not be effective; there are three possible reasons for this: one of them is that the lump should be divided into three or four stitches along the length of the scrofula.
In the shape of abdominal stitches, their appearance should resemble that of abdominal stitches, with a gap between each stitch wide enough for the tip of the finger to pass through and the quality of the incision should be the same as in an abscess; do not penetrate too deep with your hand and the patient should lie on his back.
The third reason is in the edge, and lift the skin that is affected by scrofula where the patient's left scrofula ends and lift the skin that is affected by scrofula where the right scrofula ends; your lifting of the skin should be on the abdomen so that the stitches are along the length of the body.
Then the siphons will enter a large enclosed area until they reach the skin from the opposite side, then the scoop is removed and the four cysts appear. If you wish to cure with the third siphon, use it instead.
The place of the cyst is treated after leaving it to drain for several days, as this heals better than any other treatment.
Chapter one, thirty.
On draining cysts.
Cysts are beneficial only for deep draining, if the cyst is treated with the treatment we have mentioned in the classification, it will not heal. In this case, it is necessary to create four cysts around the site and one on the abscess.
Another cyst is made on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind his back between the ribs, one under his chest and another under his abdomen. The depth of the cyst should be close to the skin incision. Then leave the cyst open for a long time to drain pus.
Do not leave the incision open from treatment after the cyst, as it is necessary to collect all its contents quickly, and the scoop used for the back should be shaped like a strap according to its shape, and the one used for the abdomen should be ladle-shaped.
Chapter Two and Thirty.
On the Feet and Ankles.
If a pain occurs in the ankle joint and it swells with white fluid, it is necessary to bleed it on the back of the foot between the Achilles tendon and the posterior malleolus.
Hold your hand with the cupping glass and do not move it, then lift your hand without returning it to its position as the white fluid is drawn out and the cupping glass will be in this shape.
Then, bleed the ankles twice in each ankle, with one point at the inner side of the cupping glass and the other on the length of the ankle bone, one below the malleolus and another towards the middle of the ankle, and on each leg, two cuppings.
Leave the cupping glass open without treatment for a long time until the fluid drains from it, then treat it with whatever we have mentioned before.
Chapter Three and Thirty.
On Dislocations.
If the dislocation is due to cold and swelling until the muscles weaken, affecting the joint and socket, and if this cannot be reduced by the force of treatment and it seems unlikely that the dislocation will improve on its own or the strength is weak, then make a large incision over the joint. According to what follows in any limb, a circular incision is made along with four small incisions around the pit (sore) for soft, fine suturing and a large incision on the skin above the pus, or two incisions.
If you find numerous pus and the abscess is likely, make an incision on the affected area and on each pustule, possibly two small ones near the large one. This treatment is effective, its benefit is not to be missed if God wills it.
The fourth and thirtieth chapter.
On the treatment of fractures.
If the fracture has numerous immovable bones or one bone that is hard and cold, or pus that are putrid and swollen as described in the classification, then treatment will not be successful. In this case, make three small incisions below the shoulder blade near the spine.
If the abscess is below the pit and if its pus has become cold, is not consolidating, and its appearance is inflamed, make a large incision on the abscess as it follows and another incision on its cavity. Another one on an ulcer with a sutured wound, leave it open for some time, then treat it until it heals, if God wills.
The Fifth Thirtieth Chapter.
On the Bleeding Disorders.
After cutting it (the blood vessel), if the bleeding persists, pinch the wound that resembles a vein, then insert a ligature into the same cut and tie it up until you reach the mouth of the artery from which the bleeding is coming. Do this once or twice.
If there are many bleeding disorders, treat each one according to what has been described above and then apply the cure until it heals. And if a large ligature is applied on cotton, it will have more benefit.
The Sixth Thirtieth Chapter.
On the Nasal Polyps that may be found in the Nostrils.
If the cause of the problem cannot be found in the location we have described, and it is necessary to abandon that treatment, then it may not heal by itself. However, if a nasal polyp occurs and the discharge from it and the harmful secretions persist, first you should tie it with a thin wire.
Then, know the size of the bladder by a measure, then fill the container that resembles a mill, then introduce it into the patient's bladder with precision, keeping in mind the size that the measure has entered and make the incision on it until those corrupt bodies are burned; one or two or three times according to your need.
Keep in mind to avoid burning the urethra, even if it is narrow or very narrow, and if the bladder is leaking urine or pus.
Remember all these points, but only perform the procedure if the bladder is in a state of inflammation and you are confident that it is not perforated, then treat the area until it heals. If the area is closed off and the materials removed, but it remains like this for some time, then know that it has been completely healed.
If the materials are not removed, then know that it is perforated or in a state of bladder stone or something similar mentioned in its description.
The Seventh and Thirtieth Chapter.
On the Kidney Incision.
If there is a pain in the kidney due to cold or thick wind and the reason for this is confirmed, it is necessary to place a tube on the same kidney with a similar tube for each kidney using the milled container previously mentioned and perhaps three such tubes in the same area, then three sealed containers will be more effective.
Chapter Eighteen and Thirty.
On the Subject of Cataract.
If weakness and trembling occurs in the cataract due to cold or moisture to the extent that the eyelid cannot be closed, put a cup on the bottom of the eye socket, on the cataract where the hair of the cataract starts and another one from the left side of the socket and another one from the right side.
After the cup, from each side, it should be fastened as much as possible and a cup should be placed below the forehead or two if necessary, and the cup should be bandaged to what follows.
Chapter Nine and Thirty.
On the Subject of the Womb.
If cold or moist matter occurs in the womb, abstain from intercourse and open its passage and delay its use, or if it pains her at conception, there should be three cups around the socket as mentioned in the section on cataract. A cup on the belly below the navel or two, and the cup should be bandaged.
Chapter Forty.
How to perform a mastectomy.
When incorrect moisture settles in the breast, it may cause it to protrude from its place and a sign of this is when one side elongates compared to the other if they are pressed together and you find that the place of removal is hollow, it is necessary to mark the nipple area with a circular incision.
After learning the art of measurement, you should position the same point in the center of the circle and the incision mark made for the procedure should be in its center. If that incision mark is not present, then make three marks around the larger olive-oil flask.
Make the incision deep enough to pierce through the entire skin, then treat it until it heals if Allah wills.
The forty-first chapter.
How to perform a castration on women.
If a wound occurs in the breast, caused by cold and moisture, and treatment according to what has been mentioned in the previous chapter does not result in healing, it is necessary that the nipple be relieved of thick, sticky adhesive or similar substances.
Then, make the incision and turn its face towards cuts either with medications that burn or with fire. The incision with fire should be made on several faces, at least three marks in a triangular shape on this diagram.
The depth should be appropriate and it should be between every knot, the size of a fingertip. The ligature should be made of threads and there could be a knot in the middle on the end of the suture needle, making four knots. If you wish, make it in the circle that he mentioned when the suture is exposed at one place.
The suture should encircle the entire wound and burn off all the skin, this is the characteristic of a ligature for female patients when the injury does not extend to the penis or anus.
If it extends to the penis or anus, use two sutures on the penis at the location indicated by the attending physician with regard to the injury, and a fourth of four fingers distance from the anus, the ligature should be made of skin and the depth of the knot should be the thickness of the skin only.
If the injury extends to about the toes of the foot, use three or four sutures or as many as necessary there, and if it is under the buttock towards the anus, use a single skin ligature at that location.
Preserve in all circumstances that it does not reach the nerves, until it burns a muscle or tendon strongly. Speak about this with caution and discretion, or at an appropriate time.
I have seen two people who were bitten by a snake on the head and it reached their nerves, causing their hand to swell until it reached the ankles and pressing hard on everything. Then, after that, there was paralysis and death. If the wound is in both areas equally clearly, this is what happens.
Some of the wise scholars have mentioned that in wound treatment, this type of needle has a specific characteristic. It is made of iron and its diameter is half a finger width, and it should be at the front teeth on a date stone or slightly smaller, and inside this needle is another needle and a third one.
The distance between each needle should be the size of a finger ring, and the needles should be open from both sides and their height should be about a finger ring or two, and a handle made of iron is taken for them, which is suitable for the needles, and this is its shape.
Then, it is heated in the fire until it turns red and the poison is killed, then it is placed on the correct location of the wound and the patient remains still on the correct side, and three needles are inserted in one movement, then it is left for three days and moistened with oil, leaving the wound open for several days.
It treats many (of them) with mercury until it purges, he said, place this book in such a kind of ink that we have used for its art, and the appearance of it is good, and little difficulty will be found by those who can endure it; only the best of men will endure it and hit its mark.
As for the ink with medicinal preparations, it is to make small hollow balls that contain sulfur or copper.
There should be a height of approximately two fingers or similar, and there should be a depth of about the width of a fingernail between them, and they should be open at the bottom and open at the top, and they should be linked together in this shape.
Then, place them on the wound that is open and bleeding slightly, press your thumb gently, then pour water between the two circles, it should be hot but not boiling, hold it for a sand hour, let the bleeding stop, and burn it with fire; you will find that it burns like fire.
Let it become dry, then lift your hand with the instrument and wash the wound completely with warm water, then apply cold water to it, leave it for three days and put oil on it until the color of the burn disappears, and leave it for as long as pus is coming out; it achieves the greatest benefit.
Then treat it with leeches until it (the wound) bleeds, if the injury extends to the leg or the foot, make containers for them which hold water according to what is made for veins elsewhere, and this is the characteristic of cutting water (which has been proven in a treatise on pharmaceuticals).
Take from common salt and quicklime (which is not burnt) equal parts, crush them and put them into new containers which you have pierced at the bottom with a small hole on the container so that the liquid can pass through it. Put another container beneath the first one which has holes in it.
Apply sharp, painful water (leech) to the ulcer and sore, after firmly holding them with your hand. Leave it until the sharp water descends to the bottom of the squeezed vessel, then collect all of that water. Apply it again to another sore and another ulcer.
It is then strong in many medical practices and in all the limbs, because it performs the work of fire itself. Among medicines, there are some similar to leeches, such as vinegar, pitch resin, and sulfur with soap.
Galenus affirmed a story of a man from the ancients who treated scabies and leprosy, and emphasized his remedy greatly, claiming that nothing else was necessary for treatment and that it would cure from one application.
Until it is said that a person carried himself into the bath and came out cured, provided he took from green lupine, if it was not available then taking fresh lupine and finely grinding it with something greasy and applying it to the scabies where the sore is or in the foot or leg.
Apply pressure for a period of three hours, or until the burning sensation ceases. Then immerse it in warm water. If pus comes out, immerse it in the container. The pain will disappear with Allah's permission. If it does not, apply the plaster again after ten days.
"It will heal, with Allah's will. However, no one should use this medicine unless the wound has healed completely. Galen stated that the vinegar of the mustard seed helps when a woman's genitals are swollen.
"The vessel should be made of this type, take wool and soak it in olive oil, then place it on the deep wound between the wrist and the ankle (closer to the ankle), then take a dry mustard plaster.
"Heat it in fire until it becomes a rod, then place it on the wool and leave it until it cools down, then take another one and repeat this process until the sensation of pain reaches the middle of the arm and the wound settles with Allah's permission. This method is called the mustard plaster.
"Chapter twenty-four
In case of abdominal pain.
In case of abdominal pain, it may be due to various causes such as falling or hitting or perforation and similar cases, and it may be from the swelling of cold and wet matter. Indeed, this type occurs only in this class.
If it is from the swelling of cold matter, after removing the cause (of pain), it should be bound on the abdomen where the pain is, in three layers over the midline, after learning its location with a probe in each layer, with five or more pressure points depending on the possibility and strength of the cause.
The swelling is with a puncture point; you may wish to puncture it three or four times with a medium thread suture on this figure.
Third and fourth sections.
In case of beginning of abscess.
This disease often affects young children, and a sign of the beginning of it in the child is that he experiences shortness of breath upon activity and movement, and in the end, small boils will appear on various parts of his body.
If you see it and wish to stop it, then plug it with a round stopper as shown in this figure. Take the forceps on all sides of the artery, apply pressure and if you wish to tie it around the artery with a double or triple ligature, make sure the knots are close to each other, then treat the site until it heals as we have described.
Preserve the use of the forceps in the vein that is constricted by a nerve.
Chapter Four and Forty.
On the Treatment of Sutures and Fractures.
If fractures occur from cold abscesses in any part of the body, and if they occur in the legs, doctors usually call them specific fractures.
If the cold fracture arises due to the treatment we have described and the abscess does not subside, then the forceps must be used after it has been evacuated around the fracture of the legs with several forceps, and the ligature should be made of moderate size as shown in this figure.
If you need to ligate on the face of the leg, do so with a ligature, for if the abscess rises to the knees or other fractures and this often happens, then use forceps on each knee with three or four from each side with this medium-sized ligature.
If the wound exceeds this [size], make it larger and do not probe with the instrument, but only to the depth of the skin. If the wounds reach the armpit or chest, use what was previously mentioned regarding probing in its section.
If the wounds are only in the hands, we shall cauterize around the veins as they wind around. If the wounds remain in the fingers, we shall cauterize each of them at every joint and on the palm. If the wounds progress after several days towards the wrist or elbow.
Make them both from every side and let no hindrance prevent the good care and taking of medicine, for indeed the best food and evacuation of humors will help with this instrument, if God wills it.
The fifth and forty-fourth chapter.
Procedure for cauterizing with a probe.
If a fistula or abscess appears in the armpit and some discharge and pus accumulates, and this was an early stage, it is necessary for the patient to be instructed to fast on that day and to use one of the malungai nuts, which will purge the bile from his liver.
Then he shall lie down between your hands on his back and you shall instruct him to hold himself until the discharge or pus is released. Then you shall press it with your finger, then teach him by feeling under the fistula on the bone of the elbow, a sign that resembles half a circle, the edges of which are towards the top of the body.
Then, bandage this vessel with its shape.
Then, wait for the pus to come out and drain it or the abscess into its cavity. Then, the servant places his hand on the spot so that the abscess does not burst. Then, you expose what is between the fingers and place it underneath, and another servant ties it (the bandage).
And another, presses his hands on top of it, then the vessel is lowered onto the mark itself and your hand with the vessel, standing straight and holding it until it reaches the bone or returns again if it does not reach the bone in the first attempt.
Keep your effort from the abscess bursting, so that it does not burn it and that happens to the patient either by death or great disability. Know that when you do not reach the bone with the instrument, your operation has not succeeded. It is recommended that the vessels for the children should be soft according to their capacity and for the adults according to theirs.
Then, treat the wound after three days with oil until the pus disappears, then treat it with all types of medications until it heals. The patient should be lying down on his back for forty days until the wound is closed.
It is recommended to make his diet a remedy that softens his stomach so that it does not be agitated during bleeding and then, if he intends to wait for forty days, use strong ligatures, hold them for four more days, let him rest from fatigue and avoid excessive eating, drinking, and sexual intercourse.
If this procedure is followed correctly, it will heal completely, if God wills, and I will explain the treatment for a perforation in the anus in its chapter, if God wills, and as for a perforation that occurs elsewhere in the abdomen and started as a small perforation, if you want it not to worsen, apply a plug on it to stop it. Let what is burnt from the skin, such as a third of it, be treated with what we have mentioned earlier, and if God wills, it will not worsen. Some early scholars recommended sealing a perforation with a plug like this figure.
After you have learned to seal a perforation with sutures, make the stitch on the upper side of the perforation and the other stitch below it, and lower your hand in the middle with a single strong suture, the first stitch should be easier and better if God wills.
Chapter Six and Forty.
On the topic of wounds.
If a wound happens in some limb due to a fall or blow and the pain persists for a long time despite treatment with medications, it is necessary to cauterize with a needle-like instrument according to the size, smallness, weakness, and strength of each limb.
The wound and the pain from it are relieved if the first cauterization is successful; otherwise, the cauterization should be repeated because, by habit, these wounds often move from one limb to another nearby. Therefore, they should be followed with the cauterization until the cause is removed.
Chapter Seven and Forty.
On the topic of fractures.
Those who have fractures can greatly benefit from cauterization and it is useful for a certain type of fracture, one that has occurred due to relaxation of bones and the loosening of ligaments.
If you want to cauterize, observe the fracture first. If it is new and we have treated it as described in the division and it has not healed or stopped, suspect that corruption may affect all its aspects. In this case, cauterize five times on the head. One in the middle of the head, molded; the second below it near the forehead at the end of the hair; two on the temples; one from behind on the nape of the neck; and apply your thumb gently until it affects the bone with an easy impact.
Remove the scab from it to ease the passage of thick phlegm from it and also apply a probe on the same place as it advances, and if the bone has persisted in the injury and has become apparent, it is necessary to apply these probes mentioned in the head. Incision on the side of the nose and two incisions on both cheeks and two on the temples, four on the ribs (flanks) and one large one at the elbow when the arm is paralyzed, another above it in the same dish, and two on each shoulder blade. Two on the hands, one on each finger and two on each joint of both legs, incision on every space between the joints of his fingers and toes.
Keep away from the bone at the end of the shoulder, as not to burn them both. Incision may be made on the bone of the elbow, another on the upper jaw and another on the abdomen. Be aware that every incision is beneficial and healing.
Know that the incorrect incision may cause pain, but a correct one will be beneficial for the body. The scars should be large or small according to the nature of the limbs and joints in alignment with the characteristics of the bones.
Then, treat the wound with fine cornmeal and honey along with other treatments until healed, if God wills it.
Chapter eighty-four.
In case of a fracture in any limb and it is not dislocated, apply medication, plasters and bandages without breaking the skin. If necessary, drill small holes for bleeding into the leather coverings slightly.
Then, treat it with mercury until it heals. It should be noted that some fractures in the upper limb and leg are exposed to the back during exit of the nerve that moves that limb. In such a case, the fracture will heal faster.
Only those who are skilled in cutting bones and extracting movable nerves of the body should perform this.
Chapter ninety-four.
In case of an abscess.
If an abscess does not respond to any of the usual treatments in medicine, make a small incision with a depth just enough for the skin to be penetrated slightly until the pus drains and its color changes.
Then, apply cauterization with vinegar and lard or poppy seeds oil mixed together from each part. Mix all together and apply it to the wound until it heals.
The Chapter Fifty-One.
On Cancer.
If the cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, tie it with a circular suturing tool as it revolves. Some scholars have suggested that one should tie a large ligature in the center but I do not see that as effective because it may spread and I have witnessed this happen several times.
The correct method is to tie it around with a circle or multiple ligatures.
The Chapter One Hundred and Fifty-One.
On Fractures.
If a fracture occurs in someone and it has not yet started healing, either from the active cause or from the delaying cause, if the person is elderly with little blood, or due to time and you wish to speed up the healing of the fracture, tie it tightly with many small ligatures.
Then leave it, for it will quickly suppurate. If you want to lance it, lance the abscess as shown in this image.
Draw it out to the midpoint of the cavity so that the abscess wall is exposed, and make a small incision in what lies beneath to facilitate the flow of pus, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
The second and fiftieth section.
On the subject of abscesses.
An abscess is a corruption that eats away at a part of the body, just as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an abscess in a place where it can be lanced with fire, make many small and large incisions in the abscess using a cautery, according to what is appropriate for that location where the abscess is.
Then, incise it from all sides until the corruption is completely excised and nothing of it remains, then leave it for three days and apply large amounts of limewater and oil to the abscesses until all the pus and corruption has been drained.
Then, treat it with ointments made from fat for meat, and if after three days you find that the meat has grown healthy without any corruption in it, then the abscess is cured. Otherwise, repeat the lancing on what remains of the corrupted areas, as the abscess can also be treated with sharp medicines.
It stands in the fire [something/somebody] is cured more quickly, and I have mentioned its treatment with cutting medicine in the division. Take it whenever you need it.
The third and fifty-fifth section.
In regard to both the straight and curved needles.
Often, this disease occurs under the feet and it is a hard thing that causes man's distress; in it, there are two types: one by fire and the other by sharp water.
As for the kind by fire, it is to heat a long, thin iron probe similar to an eagle claw, made of iron and fitting around the needle from all sides and being sharp at the edge, then you lower it onto the needle with a handle, then you rotate your hand with the probe around the needle until the probe reaches the depth of the needle.
Leave it for three days to fester, then press with a warm, sharp, salted pestle on it. Leave the pressure on it overnight; it will burst from its base. Then treat the wound with fresh meat fat until it heals, unless the metal pins are not pointed.
Whenever there is an abscess on the body, especially in hands or feet, it's necessary to take a tube made of copper, iron, or eagle feathers and place it over the boil. Then pour boiling water into the tube until it eases out.
Hold your hand and manipulate it gently so that the tube affects the boil's base effectively. The boiling water will find its way to the boil, and the pressure of the hot water will last for an hour.
Then, the boil will burst from its base, and you repeat this process until it bursts everywhere on the body. After it bursts, treat each area with fresh meat fat until it heals.
The Fourth and Fiftieth Sections.
In case of dislocation.
If dislocation occurs in one of the joints of the limbs (or in any other part), four or five splints should be made from cane on the back between each joint, and a splint in the chest. And on its side, a splint made with olive oil bottles; for dislocation it settles and hastens the healing of cold disease.
The fifth and sixth chapter.
In case of sudden abdominal swelling.
When sudden abdominal swelling occurs due to thick, putrid, festering substances, on its appearance, a gentle splint should be made on the head of each swelling using wood, heated iron or long ivory rods or olive oil bottles.
The fractures occur in the initial burst of it on this condition, and the active principle does not increase and the cause is repelled from it except that it should be after the evacuation of the cause by the cut.
The Sixth Chapter and Fifty-Sixth Section.
On the fracture that occurs during cutting of the arteries.
Frequently, bleeding from the arteries occurs during injury, exposure to the outside or through a wound or fracture or similar cases where cutting is difficult.
If any of these occur, quickly move your hand to the artery and press it firmly until blood is confined under your finger and nothing comes out of it, then place small and large olive-oil bottles around it and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, according to the injury and position where the artery has been cut and lower the container on the same wound after removing your finger with a roller and hold the container until the blood is cut off.
If bleeding occurs when lifting your finger from the artery and the container is removed, take another container with a roller from the heated containers and continue doing this with one after another until the blood is cut off.
Preserve (the instrument), do not burn it, for if there is a nerve there, it will be spoken of regarding the ailment differently. Know that if blood flows from the arteries, it cannot be cut and especially not if the arteries are large, except by one of four methods; either by cauterization as we have said, or by ligature if it has not been tied yet. If the artery is cut and blood flows out, or if it can be tied with strong and secure thread, or if medicine that causes clotting and strong constriction can be placed on it, this will suffice.
If one tries to cut the artery with ropes or by squeezing or placing burning objects near it and so on, it will not be cut by that method except in a rare case, such as if no doctor or medicine is present. In such a situation, he should insert a finger into the wound as we have described.
He should press it very hard until the blood clots and a bulge forms above the wound and on the arteries and fingers. The hand must not leave the area until the cold, strong water continuously freezes the blood, solidifies, coagulates, and cuts through. During this time, he should also consider what is needed for cauterization or medicine.
Chapter Two.
In incision, ligation, excision, and surgeries related to these matters.
It has been mentioned in the first chapter that every disease can be cured by fire, burning medicines and cauterization, their causes, reasons, tools and images of containers. This is a summary from ancient times to modern days.
And I will describe in this chapter that path clearly so it is easier for the student to understand.
Before I begin, it is necessary for you to know that this chapter is related to caution in what was mentioned in the first chapter about cauterization.
Therefore, it is necessary for a warning to be stronger since the work in this chapter often involves large amounts of blood loss which is essential for life when an artery or vein is cut, or incision on an abscess, or ligation, surgery, extraction of stone or incision on a tumor and so on. These all carry great risk, fear, and death is more likely to occur in most cases.
And I advise you to be cautious in matters that are ambiguous as this profession has had its share of accidents from people with stab wounds who have died due to their disease.
A fracture, which is found to be sharp and long, and in a sick person it indicates approaching death. Some of them will offer you wealth and assist you out of hope for health and the treatment of their illness; it is not permitted for you to help those with this kind of fracture.
Be cautious, for caution is better than your desire, and do not hasten in anything of this except with certain knowledge that it will have a favorable outcome. Use knowledge and warning in all the treatment of your illnesses.
Indeed, in this there is help for you to attain praise, glory, remembrance and thanksgiving. May Allah guide you and not forbid you success, indeed that is in His hands; there is no deity but Him.
This chapter is arranged in a progressive order from the foot to the head, so as to make clear to you the demand for what you desire of it, if God wills.
The First Chapter.
Treatment of water that accumulates in the heads of infants.
This fracture often occurs in infants during birth if the skull of the infant is not properly aligned, and it can also occur due to hidden causes that are not known.
I have not encountered this illness except in children, and all that I have seen of them hasten towards death because of it. Therefore, I have abandoned its treatment. However, I have seen children whose heads are filled with water and whose skulls thicken every day. I have not seen a child sit on his own to let his skull harden and moisture increase until he dies.
This moisture either accumulates between the skin and bone, or it accumulates beneath the bone on the skull, and treatment in this case is to make a single deep incision in the middle of the head if the moisture is between the skin and bone and the worm is small, thus relieving the moisture. This is called trepanation.
If the swelling increases and the wound becomes larger, make two intersecting incisions on this shape:
And if the swelling is under the bone and it is indicated by the fact that you see the hairs of the head opening from all sides, and water decreases when you press it with your hand but it is not concealed (this condition is upon you), then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head according to this shape.
After the incision, all of the swelling comes out, then you press and drain the incisions, then you cover it with alcohol and oil for five days, then the dressing is removed and the wound is treated with ointment and honey, but do not leave the scalp unattended and feed the patient with dry food with little moisture.
Until the limb is strong and healed, another method of incision is to look at where the bone of the tumor appears and where the water accumulates because it may be in the back part of the head or in the front or on the right or on the left.
The incision is where the tumor appears and the water accumulates, so you should make an incision at that place and carefully preserve it (to avoid cutting nerves), and a discharge will occur as the patient dies from the discharge along with the release of pus.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries that lie behind the known ears, [known as] the temporal arteries.
When a sharp edge comes towards the eyes or chest, and there is no help with medications, then treatment in this case would be cutting these two arteries.
In order to cut them, the patient's head should be shaved with a razor, then the area should be firmly grasped with a sharp forceps to expose the arteries, and their location should be looked for behind the ears - in two recessed areas that are not visible except in some people.
Then, teach them (the patient) about the measurement, then cut both (bones) at the neck with the saw in pieces to the bone and that should be at the width of the head, and if you wish, enter the neck from under the jaw and bring it up with cuts so that its length is approximately two fingers' widths joined together.
If the neck is cut, blood will come out spurting to the front and wet clothing, but if the jaw does not appear for touch, it is necessary to measure from the ear after four fingers then teach about measurement and cut to the bone. What must be done.
Blood will be sent in jets or more or less, according to the strength of the wound and filling of the jawbones, then examine the injury. If there remains on the bone from the cheek something, cut it off.
In case of a hot wound, burn, then treat the injury with a blistering plaster until it heals.
Third Section.
Treatment of fractured jaws in the sockets (i.e., inside the mouth).
If a patient suffers from a swelling or hard painful nodules in the jaws or a deep and severe abscess, and is treated with medical remedies but does not improve, we have found in these diseases the treatment of jawbone fractures or similar as described earlier.
The aim of the procedure is to shave the superficial hair in the armpits, as it clearly appears through its growth and what is hidden by it. This will become clear to you from its pulse and faintness, except for what is private among people.
When it is cold, if you are covered, shave the back of your head with a cloth. Then check the location by pricking or moisten the location with hot water until the lymph nodes appear clearly and distinctly. Then take the affected area as depicted in this image. Then, scrape the skin with it until you reach the lymph nodes. After that, place a leech on it to draw it up and bring it out of the skin and clean it from all the scabs surrounding it. If the lymph node is delicate, direct the leech towards its side. Then, cut a piece from it that is as wide as possible without squeezing or causing bleeding. After that, let the blood drain naturally without cutting or pricking until there is no flow of blood at all. Then, drain all the blood from it in three to six leeches.
If the lymph node is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong thread made of either silk or strings from a violin, as the thread can either be from silk or strings from a violin to prevent pus from collecting before the incision for bleeding occurs.
Then, the fat between the sutures is to be cut. This can be done at that hour or after a later time, and if you wish, you may sew it onto the bone with a needle and thread until its edges grow, so this position of work is to be carried out with caution.
After the incision, if the cause is putrefaction or swelling due to inflammation, the wound should be cleaned with vinegar and then treated by sewing it up with thick thread and placing proper drains on top. After the abscess is cut open, it should be treated with cold medicines that cause flesh decay and with poultices until the skin heals, if God wills.
If, while performing your work, bleeding occurs from the incision, cut it off with a scalpel or fill the site with cotton and press until the blood stops flowing, if no assistance is available, hold your finger over it until the bleeding stops.
Place the site in strong cold water until the wound heals and press on it as required, and among the easiest ways to stitch the veins is by using this needle with thread after learning the positions with the ligature.
The amputation tool should be descended very deeply until it reaches the bone, and the artery should be severed in two places so that what is between them may separate; for it does not adhere to this sort of punctured wound, and this is the image of a saw.
The tips of the two saws resemble each other except that it should be a smaller point than the saws because if they were like saws, they would freeze more quickly and meat would not be cut as fast. If there is some strength in them, hold them over the fire.
Cut the meat quickly, and this work is better than all works and easier, and there should be a space between the saws equal to the length of the thumb.
Fourth section.
Treatment of constant, burning tears in the eyes.
If the tears are constant and if they flow from the arteries that run on the forehead from outside, and no medication for eye treatment with drugs has helped him, and you see the face of the cause is red. He feels pain in his cheeks like the sting of an ant, and his eyes are swollen and wet with tears that have eaten away at their lids and stopped their movements due to tear ducts; so the first remedies for this treatment are forced to resort to this method, and it is known as the razor treatment, which is to order the person to shave his hair on the forehead.
Then make three incisions in the forehead, parallel to its length. The length of each incision should be about two fingerbreadths. The first incision should be in the center of the forehead, the second one slightly away from the movement of the arm (which is located on the shoulder), and the third one on the opposite side.
Keep the two incisions on both sides and keep your hand away from connecting the jaws. The distance between each incision should be about three fingerbreadths, and with you have a sharp knife or a sharp instrument for cauterization ready to stop bleeding as it flows.
Then insert the pointed probe, which resembles this image. From the first incision towards the shoulder, cut all the skin between the incisions with a scalpel on the bone. Then do the same from the central incision to the third incision, and then remove this probe. Also insert another tool, called a knife with a sharp edge from one side and a blunt edge from the other, as shown here:.
The handle should be sharp on one side and blunt on the other, towards the muscle attached to the skin, and the blunt side towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the central incision, cutting all the nerves that descend from the forehead to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then, do it in the middle incision to the other, and after the excess blood is removed, squeeze the locations from solidified blood, then boil cotton in oil or pitch and place it on them.
Then, let it not become a hot abscess and on the third day, let the sutures dissolve, then treat it with the Basilicon ointment made of beeswax and various other substances used in surgeries until it heals, if Allah wills.
The Fifth Chapter.
Treatment of tear ducts and nasal discharge from within the head to the eyes.
When someone experiences frequent, sharp, burning nasal discharge that is continuous and their eyes appear sunken and weak with inflamed eyelids and tears flowing from them. When there is severe pain deep in the head, accompanied by a persistent discharge, be aware that these symptoms are caused by numerous deep channels. The best treatment for this is the following: tell the patient to shave their head, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
When there is severe pain deep in the head, accompanied by a persistent discharge, be aware that these symptoms are caused by numerous deep channels. The best treatment for this is the following: tell the patient to shave their head, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Raise it slightly in width and begin from the left arm-pit to the right arm-pit, and let the incision be made into the bone. Keep your hand away from the moving muscles near the joint until you discover the bone and all the blood is drained with a sponge.
Separate the two incisions with linen cloth or cotton thread, then open from above with reeds and drink the potion along with oil to prevent a hot boil. When it has been broken and you see that the hot boil has ceased, it is necessary to chisel the bone until there begins to grow flesh in it.
Then treat it with a dry dressing which causes the flesh to grow, such as taking from barley flour and adding four parts of calves' fat to it, then kneading them together and using it for growing flesh in surgeries like these.
The sixth section.
Treatment of what falls into the ear.
Whatever falls into the ear belongs to one of four types, either a mineral stone or something resembling it like iron and glass, or a plant substance like wheat and beans and similar things, or something liquid like water and honey and similar things.
If an animal falls into the ear, when a stone or any other substance not usual in the ear enters it, accept sunlight on the affected ear; if you see the stone, squeeze some oil or fat onto it and then try to remove it by moving the head or blowing through a reed. Tighten the external auditory canals when an otitis (ear inflammation) occurs, after placing around the ear a hot poultice or soft cloth. Move the affected ear towards the top as much as possible; often it will come out with this treatment. If not, then try to remove it gently using the fingerprint method depicted here.
If it comes out with the fingerprint method and not otherwise, then try to remove it gently using a small thin probe made of copper and insert one end of the tube into the ear canal.
Tighten the area around the tube with molten beeswax so that there is no other path for the air, then attract it strongly and repeatedly with your breath; often it will come out, but if not according to what we described earlier, take from the end of a feather or the curved end used by birds to catch something smooth, place it in the tube.
After a pus-filled boil breaks, it should be inserted into the ear canal after the ear has dried. If it does not come out with all that was described earlier, one must return to the procedure before the hot swelling or inflammation occurs.
The procedure for the ear is to press the affected area first and drain the blood as much as its strength allows, then place the affected area between your hands and tilt the head so that the ear is facing upwards, then make a small incision at the bottom of the ear canal where it is swollen.
The incision (shiqqa) should be long enough to reach the ear bone, then remove it using whatever tools are available, quickly suture the incision and treat it until it heals.
If something falls into the ear, such as one of the seeds that swell and inflame, try to remove it as described earlier. If you cannot remove it, grasp a thin, delicate probe on this image.
Try to cut up that type of swollen seed which falls into the ear, provided you are sure that the seed has absorbed the ear's sweat so that it becomes small fragments. Then extract them using tweezers or a gentle probe or a hook.
As we have mentioned, it is easy to extract it (impacted object). Regarding the water in the ear, it is necessary to use the curettage with a spoon-shaped instrument first. Then fill the affected ear with some cotton wool and place it on the ear containing the water, so that if it comes out with this.
Take a large number of pebbles, smooth them and heat them slightly with fire. The instrument is inserted into one of the holes in the ear and the pebble is held on the end of it, then strike it with another stone that is inside the ear.
Continue to do this with pebble after pebble until all the water comes out. Water can be extracted by using a feather or reed, one end is inserted into the ear and the other end is heated with fire until it burns more, then another reed is used.
Continue to do this until all the water is extracted or sucked out with a syringe attached to the pebble, and regarding the removal of the animal inside it (the ear), if it is small like a worm, treat it as described in the previous section, otherwise...
If the body part is large, it can be felt, try to extract it with forceps and curettes, and it will be easier than anything found in the ear. As for the extraction of pus produced in the ear, if treated as described in the chapter on abscesses and the treatment does not work.
It is necessary to examine the ear in sunlight, and if you see something from pus then extract it with forceps or soft curettes; if nothing appears to you from it then take a probe of this shape.
Squeeze the lower part and widen the upper, then insert the narrow edge into the ear up to the extent that is permissible; then press it strongly several times until all the pus comes out. If it does not come out, it is a rupture around the probe, as I have told you in the abscess.
If it does not come out as described, use the probes that were mentioned and have been tried for killing pus, which can be found in the chapter on abscesses. Your salve and medicines will be in the ear with this device, and here is its shape:.
As you can see, it is made of copper or brass, narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top; if you wish, the plunger inside the probe may be hard copper; if you wish, you may take a rod and wrap it with cloth, then press it strongly.
Then apply the oil or the pulp, or whatever you desire from these medications in the ear canal. Then introduce the probe covered with cotton from above and grind it with your hand until the oil discharges deep within the ear cavity and relieves.
Afterward, heat the object that causes pain in the ear slightly, but be careful that what you are rubbing inside it is not too cold or too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Section Seven.
Treatment of unilateral deafness in the ear.
Some children may come out of their mother's womb with one or both ears not properly developed.
Moreover, some people may suffer from deafness in the ear canal due to injury or a foreign object stuck inside it, and this deafness may be deep within the ear canal that cannot be seen by the eye.
If the foreign object inside the ear canal can be seen by the eye, it is easier to extract it; however, if it is deep within the ear canal and cannot be seen, it will be more difficult to remove. In such a case, it is recommended to place the affected ear in sunlight. If you can see the deafness, open it with a gentle probe; this is its shape:.
The edge should be limited in some part and the rest of the muscle should be flat on both sides to avoid harming the ear. If the incision is made on the flesh, it may grow within the ear canal; in such a case, grasp it with a fine tweezers and cut it forcefully until all the flesh is removed.
If the incision is in the depth of the ear, take a thin and flat cannula, smooth it, then heat it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the incision along with the symptoms of hearing loss, twist it strongly until it is removed.
Preserve the nerve of the ear and then apply a linen cloth of the thickness suitable for the wound in ancient Egyptian practice, do this until you are assured of avoiding injury or take a linen cloth, soak it in water, wring it out, and apply a fine powder on it.
If you see the ear is inflamed and hot, it is necessary to remove the linen cloth and replace it with another one suitable for use in cotton made from castor oil until the heat subsides then treat it until the inflammation recovers.
If bleeding occurs, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear. Use all other treatments mentioned in the chapter on bleeding vessels.
The Eighth Chapter.
Treatment of the sores that occur in the bladder.
These sores that occur in the eye bladder can be wet or dry. They should be grasped with tweezers or a hook and cut at their roots, then a plaster made of powdered clay is to be applied to the area.
If bleeding occurs after the cutting, tie it up gently with a fine thread and apply pressure for a while. Often, if there remains something of the roots, it will heal by itself. If the roots are burnt with fire, they will not grow back.
The Ninth Chapter.
Treatment of the frostbite in the eye bladder.
Often, something similar to frostbite occurs in the eye bladder due to its tightness and hardness.
And for this reason it is called frostbite, which is a gathering of thick fluid in the upper and lower eye bladder. The treatment is to examine it; if the frostbite is hard on the surface of the bladder, move it to all sides gently, and make a longitudinal incision on it.
Then, I shall incise it from all sides with a lancet until it is clean. Then, attach it to the snare and cut it. If it does not prepare itself for you (to be cut), cut it only after the vein has been cut. This will cause no harm at all, but if the wound is large, gather it with sutures and treat it until it heals.
If the wound is small, there is no harm in it. The lancet will force and cut it. If the fat (or flesh) is close to the vein towards the inner surface of the vein, turn the vein and attach the fat with a snare without needing an incision and then make the necessary incisions from all sides.
After cutting the vein, there is no harm at all (in doing so). Then, wash the eye with salt water and treat the place where the fat was cut with something that heals until it recovers.
The Tenth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Eye Stye (Chalazion) in the Vein.
The stye (Chalazion) is a swelling that occurs in the upper layers of the vein and is most common in children, causing heaviness in their eyes and exposing them to drops during sleep and they are unable to look at sunlight. To speed up healing.
To immobilize the fracture, place your fingers on either side of it and feel for the protruding bone between them. Direct the instrument towards the fracture so that its tip is against your stone.
Then take a splint made from cane, shape it into a ring to fit around the fracture from all sides. Place it on the fracture and press it with your fingers from all sides to gather the bone in the center of the ring.
Then, make an incision in the middle of the wetness with a lancet, ensuring that the incision is not larger than the fracture and, as for depth, the skin should be completely cut until reaching the bone.
In most cases, the bone fragment will come out through the incision in the form of a white piece of shellfish. Grab it with a forceps that has been flattened between your fingers and direct your hand to pull it out carefully, ensuring not to enlarge the incision lest the cannula enters the eye and causes harm.
If the ulcer does not appear at first in the incision, you should increase the incision slightly and wait until the ulcer appears, then draw it out as we have said earlier, then press on it with your fingers, in the flesh and water, and place it on a suitable location and squeeze it, some people even add salt.
Place it in the depth of the incision to let the remaining moisture drain, then treat it until it heals. If a sore or hot abscess occurs at the location, treat it with cauterization until it heals.
The 11th chapter.
Treatment of orbital tumors.
If a tumor grows in the orbit beyond the natural canal beneath the natural socket and persists, it causes injury to the eye and results in various diseases such as chronic tearing, ptosis (drooping of eyelids), white discoloration, inflammation and redness until it becomes a cause for blindness.
Treatment of the eye can be done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire or sharp instruments on what comes out through the canal of the eye, or by surgery and suturing, or by cupping.
It is necessary to make the head of the needle in your hand, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns and otherwise, insert a cannula containing thread from below the eyelid and drive the cannula with the thread from above. This should be close to the hair itself and attract the thread to the top of the eyelid.
Turn it (the needle) with the awl, then pierce it into the deeper part of the eyelid without causing injury to the hair and pull the thread from the larger suture to the smaller one. Then, tie a small knot made of silk or cotton under the eyelid and sew it on the eyelid.
Similar to the shape of a camel's hump, it is necessary that the shape be according to what you desire for lifting the eyelid as it may vary among people. Some may need to cut an appropriate amount from the eyelid depending on how much it droops.
Some may need to cut less than that depending on the drooping of the eyelid, then pierce with the awl along the lines you tied and start from the larger suture towards the smaller one. The piercing should be close to the natural hairline like a camel's hump.
Then enters the scissors into one corner of the skin, then cuts it all, then gathers the stitches with a thread and needle and wipes off the blood and sticks together what remains of the threads with some adhesive substances.
Do it or else it won't heal, then leave the stitches for about three or four days, then treat it. If you wish to leave the wound unstitched and treat it with something that dries and contracts, the swelling will rise when the wound is sealed and sutured, and suturing is better.
This is one of the methods of cauterization mentioned at first, except that it has a benefit on the surrounding tissue and is good work with little risk, and the other method of cauterization is also to teach the swelling in the shape of an ox hide as we described. Then raise the swelling with three pairs of scissors that are either separated or gathered in this position:.
Then cut what remains of the swelling with small scissors in this position, cutting evenly:.
If you are not able to hold the scissors or do not have a tool for that, take a thread in it and insert it into the center of the shape, then insert another thread near the larger incision and a third thread near the smaller one. Gather the threads between your fingers evenly, then lift with your hand evenly.
The teacher should raise the skin fully, as we have described, then gather the wound edges with sewing and treat it until it heals. If redness or inflammation appears when you cut or open it, seal that inflammation with lint and similar substances from scented myrrh.
If the edges of the wound tend to roll down, it is necessary to use what we have mentioned of cutting, sewing, and cauterizing with fire or strong medicine. It is also permissible to cauterize or use a strong medicine on the surrounding area from the cut and sewn areas.
The cauterization with charcoal will have this characteristic: if the wound rolls and breaks the break that is inside what you have described, then make two small sticks or thin pieces of wood, their length equal to the length of the wound and their width less than the width of a finger.
By placing the strings in the sides where the stitches hold, then gathering them gently on top of the eyelid and firmly pressing the sticks from both sides, leaving it for some days. The cauterized skin will die, turn black, and become necrotic.
until it falls from itself if it is defective, then hold it with forceps, then treat it until it breaks out, if the tip rises and it does not touch the eyelashes, this is the picture of the two scrota made in this shape and this size in length and width:.
If defective, grasp with forceps and treat until it erupts; if tip rises without touching eyelashes, this depicts the two scrotums made on this shape and this size in length and width:.
In lifting the eyelashes from the eye with the tweezer.
If hair or hairs are to be plucked for the operation, take a fine tweezers, put a very thin and delicate thread of silk in it, then gather its ends and tie them with a very soft knot so that the length of the thread is about a cubit.
Then, tie another thin thread in the operation without the first one in the cavity and tie its ends if you wish, then place the patient's head on your stone and let it be close to the sun so as not to hinder the work, for this is a delicate operation. Then, insert the tweezers with the plier into the excess hair root.
Insert it into the eyelid with a small spatula until it emerges from above the natural hair, then pull the thread up to the plier and insert the spatula again to take out that hair, whether it is one or two or three, but not more than that.
Then draw your hand towards it until the hair comes out with the growth along with the natural hair in the chest. If you have drawn out the growth but not the hair, draw it down with the thread that you are holding onto until the growth comes out from the upper wound.
Then return the hair to its place and draw them both up towards the upper wound until they can be seen by the eye. Then pluck out the growth and the thread, close the eye, and leave it closed for a day or two until the hair remains in its place and the flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either add some long natural hair to it so that it grows together with it, or leave it alone until it grows longer by itself, then lift it up when it has grown.
The third chapter.
Treatment of scrotal tumors that occur in the upper chest above the eye.
This scrotal tumor, called an arnabeea, may be either natural or acquired. The acquired one results from injury or abrasion, or something similar to that.
The method of treatment is to abrade the tumor, separate the eyes of the scrotum and insert a string between them to keep it apart, and avoid using anything that causes drying or shrinkage.
If you do that (operation), the shah will return with greater pain than it was, and you should use things like salt, vinegar, walnut oil, and the juice of lemons mixed together and apply them. Then, when it has softened, remove the foreign body using forceps, and cauterize the wound with it.
Use any means to provoke pain, but do not press on the site initially, and this operation that we have mentioned is one of the corrections for the shah's condition so that the wound does not return in its previous state.
Fourth Chapter
Treatment of shah in the lower groin.
This shah which is below (the groin) is called in reality the shah and it is natural and appears to be an injury or a tear, or similar to that.
The method of working on it is to take a needle, thread it with a strong cord and sew it in the flesh, then pull it from the left side to the right until the cord appears at the edges of the flesh, then pull the flesh up with the needle and cut it off with a sharp knife.
If the wound shape returns to what is desired, otherwise take a muscle and place it on the wound gap and turn the wound with it, then make two wounds in the inner side of the wound, making the edges of the wounds from the angles of the cut you made until they meet, thus forming an angle. If it becomes similar to this shape:.
The shape of the incision is a Greek letter L, then remove that meat from its lower side below the wound, collect the separated pieces with stitches using linen thread and treat it with the medications we have mentioned earlier (mercury and pitch) until it heals.
If the cicatrix is in a straight line or stitched, or any other shape, it should be incised simply without the hair of the scabs first and then separated with a lancet as mentioned earlier.
The sentence in the treatment of cicatrix, whether it is on top or bottom, work should be done according to what suits you from the type of cicatrix as it may vary greatly in shape, and the surgeon will discuss the plan with the patient in any way possible.
Until the shape assumes its natural form or approaches it, and the disease itself indicates to you what work or instrument is suitable for it in most cases.
The Fifth Section.
In tying, to close the eye with a ligature or with an adhesive strip (bandage).
It is possible that this ligature may present itself to many people as a means of tying the upper eyelid with white thread in order to prevent it from moving freely and impeding its natural function, but it should be noted that a loop must be made under the eyelid.
And raise it above or move it with a hook, then cut the ligature gently so that it is not too tight, but rather just enough to prevent any pain during the procedure. The loop should be inserted into the eye without causing injury to it, and your incision should be like you were making that ligature.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural form and the ligature dissolves, at which point you should wash the eye with saline solution or squeeze it gently with tweezers immersed in water, then separate the eyelid from the eye using a probe made of cane.
Place a swab soaked in raw egg white above the eye, and after three days, use the forceps to pull it out when it has become pus-filled.
The sixth section.
On the cutting of the ulcer and the incision of the eyelid.
The ulcer may be of two types: either hard, resembling a sharp flint stone, or soft, resembling thick white cheese; if touched by iron or pulled with pliers, it is cut off.
If no pliers are present, both types should start from the larger mass and proceed little by little until it covers the observer and prevents light and movement of the eye. The work should be done with the operator's head on a stone.
Then, he should open the eyes and lift the eyelid with his hand, then grab the ulcer with small pliers and raise it up. He should take a thread and insert a hair from the horse or cow tail and a strong cord in it, then slightly tighten one end of the thread and sew it in the center of the ulcer.
He should carry out the procedure with the thread and tie the ulcer, raise it up and cut off the part that contains the hair from its beginning to its end as if spreading it with the hair towards the end, then cut the rest at the root of the mass using a soft blade or a small knife and leave the natural tissue.
To avoid permanent damage to the eye, it should not be cut in sections from the tear duct. The wound may then be closed with a needle and thread as we have mentioned, then punctured with a sharp probe at its edge, as shown in this image.
To prevent the eyelid from being sewn together, causing swelling, first cut it and then apply camphor or powdered alum to the eye immediately afterwards, leaving it for a day before treating it properly to ensure healing.
If the wound is not deep and cannot be probed or stitched, treatment of this type of wound is usually with medication and it heals on its own as described in the section on incisions. However, if you wish to cut it, open the eye of the patient.
Take a thin, sharp probe and place it gently at this point:. Gently pull the wound open from above with a smooth probe and if you see that it is tearing and bleeding, apply powdered alum or red ointment to the eye for a minute, then close the eye until healing is complete.
Then proceed with treatment until all the wound has healed, except if it causes pain in the eye and a high fever. In that case, leave it and treat the fever until it subsides before continuing treatment of the wound with cauterization until it heals. Regarding the swelling on the cheek, apply a hot poultice to it until it subsides.
If the nictitating membrane harms the eye, it should be attached to a probe and part of it cut off without causing bleeding. Then, it should be rinsed in the red antimony or sulphur solutions until it dissipates.
The Seventh Chapter.
On cutting the pterygium and any excess tissue growing in the eye.
In some people, red tissue may grow in the eyes to cover the sight or approach it or protrude onto the cornea and resemble a pterygium.
The work involves placing the patient's head on your stone, then opening his eye and taking all of the red flesh with suitable forceps that agree with this.
Place his head on your stone, then grasp and cut the flesh first until it is all severed. Ensure to keep the eye safe during work, as your incision may be either with the saw described in cutting the phalanx or with small hooks. This is similar to the probe's touch on whatever it encounters in this following chapter's image.
If your incision is complete and all the nerves have been severed, fill the eye with sharp salt or place within it a red paste made from medicinal foodstuffs and carry on your shoulder a piece of white linen to ward off heat.
If any nerve remains and you fear heat or infection, leave the eye alone and treat it with whatever alleviates inflammation before resuming work until it heals. Similarly, make an incision in the excessive flesh surrounding the eye of this kind.
It is necessary to avoid treating any weak eye with printing or by working with metal tools, and you should not insert your hand into anything of this nature until you are certain the limb is suitable for such work.
Chapter thirteen.
In the excision of the eyelid.
Excision of the eyelid: The vein which turns red on the eye to prevent sight must be cut, and the eye will grow weak over a period of days. At first, you should examine it; if the eye where the vein is strong and no other disease except the vein is present.
Here, he commands the assistant to place his head in your mortar then tie up those veins with one or two ligatures depending on your judgement and the sutures should be soft and gentle on this image.
They should be two ligatures in one body on this image.
Then grasp those veins with a soft thread gently and wipe the blood where they have been cut, until you see the eye has been emptied of them and the blood clots, and preserve the eye so it is not harmed by the sides of the thread, and let your work be done in the middle of the day facing the sun.
Establish in your work so as not to cut anything other than those veins, when you have separated them, squeeze in the eye the green or red vessels so they consume all that remains of the blood, for if it is impossible for you to grasp them all at that time, anoint the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye.
Leave it for days until the pain subsides and the hot worm has calmed, then resume work on her with this pattern of the painful thread around it until this pattern of the needle escapes from it.
Leave it [so that the patient's eye is in a student's headstone and the last drop of tears escapes, and it penetrates in front of and behind the eyeball and he (the teacher) is the original in the work. The eye should be opened by opening its sockets or triangular ones which the student holds.]
The teacher should make the patient's eye in the student's headstone, let the last drop of tears escape and penetrate both before and behind the eyeball. You can start by making a cut from above or below the eye, but first release two incisions on the upper eyelid. One should be at the end of the eyelash and the other one at the beginning.
Hold them between the middle and the outer edge, then place incisions under both of them. Next, hold between the cheekbone and the nasal bone, and gently slide your hand until you see all paths clearly. Cut from the left corner if using a knife or with delicate touch using scissors.
The boil breaks open on the abscess and all paths should be cleared until it rises to the incision, but do not cut the pus channel. If bile and blood flow out, they will burn you.
Then cut with the scalpel whatever is above and below, but do not leave a bridge except in the abscess cavity. If possible, lift it from the abscess cavity, as this is better, and it may heal by itself in some people.
If you have cut it and the pus does not resolve for several days and the abscess is hot, then repeat the operation on it.
The ninth section.
Treating the hernia back to the throat.
The hernia is called Naṣūra, if it is treated with hot metal or a burning medication without its description and it does not improve, then there is no remedy except to break it open near the abscess when it bursts and remove all the moisture or pus inside it.
Until the bone is exposed. If the bone is exposed and you see something black or blue in it, remove it with this device (image of the tool).
The bone fragment in the skull is called Kashna ar-Rās, it is made of Indian iron and has a rotating head like a nut, with engravings such as those of a drill or a scalpel, sharp. Place it on the black spot in the bone, then turn it between your fingers until you feel that the black spot has been removed.
Perform the procedure repeatedly, then force the location with constricting and drying medications. If it closes and meat grows within it and the flow stops for forty days and it does not renew itself or get infected, nor any incident happens in it.
Know that it has been drained, otherwise there is no cure except for the Nasir to return to the nostril hole with this characteristic: to uncover the bone secondly using iron or a sharp medicine. If the bone is uncovered, take a probe in this shape:.
The tip of the instrument should be triangular and its end conical and tapering towards the tip as you see, then place it on the bone close to the nasal septum and slightly away from the eye. Then apply pressure with your hand until the bone is expelled and you feel the obstruction.
If air comes out when one presses on his nose, then force the situation with tightening and drying medicines as you know, if the meat becomes tender and the place hardens, then the substance that was going out will return to the nostril. This is the most likely outcome, if God wills it.
If air comes out when one presses on his nose, force the situation with tightening and drying medicines as you know, if the meat becomes tender and the place hardens, then the substance that was going out will return to the nostril. This is the most likely outcome, if God wills it. (Chapter 10)
If air comes out when one presses on his nose, force the situation with tightening and drying medicines as you know, if the meat becomes tender and the place hardens, then the substance that was going out will return to the nostril. This is the most likely outcome, if God wills it. (Eyefart)
If the eye is discharged completely and no visual problem or defect occurs, it should be relieved first then directed to the nostril. Next, a compress of uncooked wheat grains should be placed in the ear without any pressure or force.
Then, place a poultice made from onion juice, ground pomegranate peel, and rose water on the eye and allow it to stay for a long time. The benefits of this treatment are that it draws out many impurities, each one from its location. The recipe for drawing out these impurities is to take a large quantity of leeches, and apply one to each of four incisions made for that purpose.
Then place one on another as much as the eye requires, then press strongly with a hard steel clamp, and release it intermittently without constraints, then remove the clamp and leave the eye closed for days and nights.
Then tighten the ligature during this process, it is necessary to press firmly, then remove the ligature after days and nights as we have mentioned, if you see that the eye has returned, otherwise return to tightening, pulling and pressing until it returns.
The title of Chapter Ten.
On the cutting of aneurysms (aneurysms).
If an aneurysm appears on the wall of the artery, then cut it open like an aneurysm, and take out the clots similar to the shape of the aneurysm, and leave the appearance of a human figure, and intend to cut it, then work on it according to what is described.
Insert a probe into the aneurysm from below to above, then insert another probe in it with a thread on its tip and pull it out, leaving the first probe inside.
Then cut the place where the thread is, tie some of the aneurysm around the probe and press it firmly, then remove the probe and place it on the eye covered with cotton soaked in white egg, leaving it until the threads come out along with the aneurysum, then treat the eye as required.
Until the wound heals, and the dressing should be tightened from every side with a thin bandage until it reaches the eye socket, causing the pus to come out. Then it should be squeezed with a delicate stick that reaches the corner of the eye, thereby draining the yellow pus and causing the eye to descend, and then the dressing is tightened again until the wound heals.
Chapter Two, Number Ten.
On the Treatment of Carbuncles.
This disease called carbuncle is a swelling that resembles watery discharge but it is not, and the method of treatment is to make the patient sit on an elevated chair then take his head with both hands.
Move him until the swelling descends to below your eye level, then hold it still and do not let go. Light will appear and the patient will see things as he used to, and if the swelling does not descend, we know that it is water, but if the swelling does not descend as we have described, the treatment has failed.
Otherwise, make the patient sit between your hands then take a thin stick and squeeze it slightly above the hard crust on the swelling until the material comes out.
If it [the wound] discharges pus, squeeze warm water that has been mixed with honey or water that has been boiled and milk and honey into the eye, then treat with all other remedies until it heals.
The Third and Fortieth Chapter.
We have mentioned the types of water [discharge] and which one is suitable for treatment in clear and understandable language, so take it from there in good health. Then, the affected person should sit with his face facing between your hands, close to the light and near the sun.
Tie the healthy eye and squeeze it hard, then lift the affected eyelid with your left hand if it is the left eye or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the edge of the discharge close to the affected eyelid with a clean, sharp instrument in the same color as the white part of the eye from the inner corner, then push the discharge out with force and you guide it with your hand until it reaches the white part of the eye and you feel that it has reached something empty.
It is necessary that the discharge goes to the depth of the eye, the distance between the cornea and the back of the eyelid, as copper can be seen in the same viewer's eye when the eye is covered with a transparent shield, then the discharge will be above the location where the water is.
Then press it down repeatedly until the water comes out, if the water does not come out for its hour, the patient can see with his eye what opens before him and there will be a pus in his eye, then it remains a little, if the water rises again, he releases it but without letting the pus come out.
If it stays firm and does not rise, the pus is removed with the fingers gently, gently until it dissolves in the water, then add common salt refined alum to the inside of the eye, then pour out all of it from outside the eye, either cat's fur dipped or soft cotton.
Coat it with oil, render it white, and bind the correct eye to it, as for us and our people we place alum on it, if the pus does not enter the eye due to its hardness because some people may have very hard eyes. It is necessary to take the instrument called the lancet, as shown in this image:.
You should puncture it with the lancet only and do not move during the puncture, as its function is to open a gentle place for the pus, then let the pus enter the place we have mentioned. After completing your work, prepare the patient gently lying down in a dark room to sleep on his back.
He should abstain from all movements and from groaning, and his food should be what agrees with his nature and he should not move his right or left head. The bandage should remain on him until the third day, then it should be unbandaged in that dark room and his eyes should be observed.
He should look at things, then the bandage should be returned on the seventh day and it is not appropriate to do that during the treatment or after the wound has healed. Instead, it is necessary to avoid doing so before water rises quickly with intense looking.
If the eye is inflamed with heat, it is necessary to unbandage the eye before the seventh day and this can be done when the inflammation subsides until it disappears. Then he should uncover his eyes and place a veil over them that covers his eyes from below in the dark room for some days.
He leaves the room gradually and investigates the cause of his problem, and know that a wound does not require learning through repeated viewing. Instead, he proceeds to work. It has been reported to me from some Iraqis that they make an open wound in the jugular vein which absorbs water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make that, nor read about it in any of the early books. It could be new, and this is a picture of types of forceps for the ignorant to use them:.
Made specifically of copper and the tip is shaped like this triangle with three pointed edges sharp:.
The fourth and fortieth section.
Treatment of abscesses in the nose.
Abscesses in the nose can be of various types, some resembling many hairy scorpions with numerous legs, some may be cancerous hard masses like coal, and some may be soft non-coal like flesh.
If the soft flesh is not malicious or cancerous, the patient should sit between your hands facing the sun and open the mouth wide to expose the abscess. Then, you should introduce a warm tool into the abscess, draw it out and cut off whatever was grasped by a sharp pointed needle from one side only.
Until you learn that all the flesh has passed, if there remains something that cannot be cut, expel it using a soft tool until nothing remains of it. If bleeding or fever and heat persist, apply a piece of cotton dipped in vinegar and leave it on for three days and nights.
Apply to what should be treated among the harmful abscesses, make incision until blood stops flowing and all meat is removed, then it should be rinsed in the nose after cutting, with water or liquor. If the nostril opens up and liquid flows out from it to the hole.
Know that it is purged, if the liquid does not flow to what it should be, then know that there is rotten meat in its upper bone parts which the tool did not reach with cutting. Then it is necessary to take a cord made of cotton to it.
Tie several knots in it and make a space between each knot, as wide as a thumb or less. The instrument should be turned so that the end of the cord is in the nostril with pressure or whatever is possible after making it similar to a pencil and draw air until it reaches the cavity.
It comes out on the hole and often does this action similar to this in the book and it is an easy matter for whoever intends it, then gather the ends of the cord, one end which came out of the mouth and the other which remained in the nostril.
Then use the meat cutting with the cord that does this until you learn that the meat has been cut by the cord, then the cord comes out and remains in the nostril after cleaning the blood, then it swallows the meat broth in the Egyptian pot three days or more.
Until the patient eats all that remains of the flesh, then there will be a last thing in the nose, a membrane made of lead, for days until it falls out naturally. If it requires treatment, dry it and use that.
This is the image of a nasal syringe used for irrigation and medication in the nose.
Place a thin wire of silver or copper, resembling a candle, bent and shaped as such.
If you wish to make the membrane closed, like a vial, then hollow out the nasal syringe.
It has a stopper at the end, as you can see, to hold the fat or any other ointments or substances when speaking through it.
The fifth and fortieth chapter.
In the upper part of the nares (nostrils).
Many times, a cyst forms on the side of the nostrils that grows larger and increases with time until it becomes noticeable.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it as soon as it appears and remove all of it, then apply either a plaster or the burning medicine that functions as the plaster, for if it grows further, look closely, if it becomes hard and black, resembling coal, be cautious when cutting.
Do not expose it to iron, for it is a cancerous worm; often I have seen the cutting of this worm causing great swelling on the patient, and even if the worm is white in color, it appears that it can be cut in all places. Empty the cyst and cut it carefully without haste, then treat the site with what dries and contracts until it heals.
The Sixth and Fortieth Chapter.
On Suturing the Nose, Eye, and Ear. If the connection is severed due to injury or similar, know that when a disconnection occurs in any of these areas (nose, eye, or ear), the work can only be done in some people.
When something of that nature is to be shown, look if the injury is clean with blood; gather together the edges of the wound with suturing, then treat it until it heals. If the connection has been severed and each break is correct, it is necessary to scrape each break with a piece of skin on the outside until it adheres.
Then, the two eyes are stitched together and pressed upon, then powders such as seeds or any other salty emetics are sprinkled on them. It is left for a few days or three, then it is undone.
And the medicine is left until the stitches dissolve from themselves, then it is treated with emetics until the wound heals. The method of stitching is either to separate the connection using thread as we have described in abdominal stitching, or using sewing thread as you know here.
Chapter seven and forty.
On the extraction of the needle which appears in the eyes.
In many people, small, hard sand-like stones may appear inside their eyes which resemble corns in some and are smaller or larger in others. It is necessary to turn the eye and press on each stone and attach it with a tweezers.
It is cut from all sides, then the place is filled with powder after cutting until the blood stops flowing and it is left to heal by itself. The wounds are dressed with what is available until they heal.
Chapter eight and ten.
In excess of flesh in the muscle. (Literally: In the increased flesh within the muscle.)
Excess of fat in the muscle is known as "abuls". It should be tied with a cord or held with forceps and cut at its root, leaving a cavity for healing or bleeding. Then it should be placed in its position, powdered.
One of the adhesive dryness remedies, if the meat returns after treatment, it often recurs. So it should be cut again and cauterized. It will not return after that.
The Ninth and Tenth Chapters.
Extraction of teeth with iron. (Literally: In the plucking of the teeth with iron.)
Inside and outside the tooth surfaces, hard rough layers may gather between the gums that can darken, whiten or turn dry until they reach the tooth itself and cause decay. (Literally: In the teeth's surfaces from inside and out, there may be harsh rough layers gathered between the gums, which may blacken, whiten or become dry until it reaches the tooth itself, causing decay.)
The patient should sit with his head on your stone and you extract the tooth and any root that appears to have hard layers and sand-like substances until nothing remains of it. Similarly, do this with decay, dryness, whiteness and other similar conditions until it is cleaned. (Literally: The patient should sit with his head on your stone and you should pluck the tooth and any root that appears to have hard layers and sand-like substances until nothing remains of it. Similarly, do this with decay, dryness, whiteness and other similar conditions until it is cleaned.)
If the vein contains some of the first part of the gangrene, otherwise the gangrene will return to it on successive days until it reaches the desired target, and know that the tooth requires various different shaped drills according to what you intend to perform.
For the purpose that the gangrene, which the tooth is rotting from within, is different from the gangrene, which the tooth is rotting from outside and between the teeth, this should be of a different shape, and these are several shapes of drills with which you will have equipped yourself.
The Thirtieth Chapter.
On Extraction of Teeth.
It is recommended that the tooth be treated from its pain by every means and you should be able to extract it without any trace remaining, since it is a noble appearance until there is no other alternative but to extract it.
If the pain persists in extracting the tooth, it is necessary to stabilize it until the tooth pain subsides. Often the pain is misjudged as being in a healthy tooth, so it is extracted, but the pain does not subside until the sick tooth is extracted. We have seen this many times from the actions of quacks.
If your toothache is in the root, then when it becomes well, you should tighten around it with a bandage using some strength until the pain subsides from all sides, then move it gently with your fingers or soft tweezers until it loosens.
Then, after that, let two big pliers be at hand and hold the jaw firmly so it doesn't move, then grab the tooth on a steady pull to avoid breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of those tools and insert it under it from all sides with a twisting motion as you did initially.
If the tooth is hollow or decayed, it should be filled with a plug and tightly sealed with a thin layer of quick-drying material to prevent it from leaking when you hold the teeth with the tweezers and it's necessary to pull it gently but firmly from all sides.
Keep your strength to avoid breaking it, as the pain from the second blow will be greater than the first. Make what you make like the blacksmiths do in their furnace and apply them gently to the tooth without using what we have described.
Often, things happen to people that are of great harm; it is easier for a tooth to be broken and the roots remain, all or some of them. Either a piece of the jawbone is broken, as we often see, then it swells after extraction by drinking or by applying honey and salt; if bleeding occurs from the site, it often happens like that. So when this happens, squeeze something from cotton wool and press it on the spot.
Or if the cotton wool does not help, use a soft silken thread which moves easily to be applied first on a long handle with a narrow mouth and stout tip so it does not slip off when you grasp it with it on the tooth, and this is the shape of large forceps: [No direct translation from Arabic]
It should be as you see, stout the mouth until when it is grasped, it does not give itself away and does not slip off; with short sides, so that it does not bend when you grasp it on the tooth. It should be made of Indian iron or strong brass with smooth sides and on one side there are projections which enter into each other to make a firm and reliable grip. [No direct translation from Arabic]
The sides can be made in the shape of a feather for it to also be strong in holding. [No direct translation from Arabic]
Chapter One, Thirty.
In the fortress of the fundamentals of fractures and the extraction of broken facial bones.
If a root remains in the fortress of the tooth socket after fracture, it is necessary to place cotton with oil on the spot for a few days until it heals, then insert a probe or forceps. The one that resembles the beak of a bird, called the burr hole drill, and this is an image of forceps:.
It should be made like a drill from inside or like an ice pick, and if it is not possible to come out with these forceps, then it is necessary to drill on the root and excavate all the flesh with a chisel, such as this small tool:.
Short, slightly stout and not sharp so that it does not break; if the root comes out with this, otherwise use these other tools, such as this, the first is a three-sided tool with some stoutness:.
An image of a light trident:.
And we can also use this tool with two prongs, such as this:.
And among other tools and instruments mentioned in the book of fractures, we can also use this tool that resembles a large screwdriver, such as this:.
Triangular notch containing a little hardness to avoid breaking, and it should not be sharp, and know that there are many types of drills and also other tools may not count, the skillful craftsman creates tools according to what indicates his work and diseases for himself.
Because among the diseases, some tools are not known for their types, so if a bone in the jaw or any other facial bone breaks or fractures, explore its place with one of these tools and forceps that have been mentioned for removing roots.
And we use this diagram.
There should be a little hardness to hold the bone, so it does not slip until the bone comes out, and we force the place with suitable drugs, if the bone is fractured it will be easier to remove, then wash it clean, and treat it until it heals.
The second and thirty chapter.
On the insertion of teeth into other than their place.
Teeth growing in an unnatural position are harmful and it is definitely bad if this happens to women or the elderly, then it should be examined if the tooth has grown behind another tooth.
It cannot be dissected or sutured, so cut it with this tool which has the following image:
It resembles a small saw, is made of Indian hard steel with a sharp edge and it should be used in multiple days due to the strength of the tooth, and not to damage other teeth. If it can be extracted easily, then extract it with forceps from India, this is its image.
It should be made entirely from India and finely crafted like the forceps used for plucking feathers, to gently extract the tooth over multiple days so as not to damage it. After it falls out, clean it with some linen cloths.
If a tooth has broken and causes pain when speaking, it should be extracted gently until the pain subsides and it heals, so as not to damage the tongue or harm speech.
The Third and Thirtieth Chapter.
On the suturing of mobile teeth with silver or gold threads.
If teeth that have been knocked out or fallen out move and cause pain, and the patient is unable to eat due to it, and treatment with binding medicines does not work, then there is no cure for it.
The trick is to stitch with a gold or silver thread, and gold is better because silver tarnishes and weakens after days, while gold remains unchanged without that issue, and the thread should be medium in size on the suture and firm enough to fit between the arteries.
The illustration of suturing is to take the thread and insert it between the correct teeth, then tighten the thread between the moving arteries, one or more until the suture reaches the correct tooth from the other side.
Then return the suture to the side it started from and tighten your hand with caution so that the knot does not move, and make the stitch at the root of the arteries so as not to loosen, then cut one end of the thread with scissors and tie them together and bind them with a ligature and hide them between the correct tooth and the moving tooth.
To prevent the tongue from being harmed, then leave it as is if nothing breaks or loosens, for if it does break or loosen, it will remain like this for a long time, and this is an illustration of teeth and the suturing method in two correct teeth and moving teeth as you see:.
A single or double tooth may fall from its place and grow together as we described, and it remains so. This is done by a craftsman who makes a bridge. He also carves bone from the ox's bone to form a dental base and places it in the spot where the tooth fell out. He presses as we have said and it remains so, and he enjoys this.
The Fourth and Thirtieth Chapter.
In cutting the ligament that is exposed under the tongue to prevent speech.
This ligament that is exposed under the tongue may be either naturally present in a person or it may appear due to injury.
The work involves opening the mouth of the patient and lifting his tongue with a smooth stone, then cutting the ligament with forceps until the tongue is released from its attachment. If there is stiffness or swelling in it, which is due to injury, apply a cupping glass and break it open until the ligament separates and heals.
Be careful not to cut too deep into the flesh, for if it is cut, the wound will open. Then, clean it with warm water or oil and cold water, then place a linen cloth under the tongue, which the patient holds in his mouth every night.
If a second incision does not occur, and bleeding occurs, place powdered hemostatic agent on the site. If blood prevails, apply a cupping glass for that purpose. Then treat it with all remedies until it heals.
The Fifth and Thirtieth Chapter.
On the extraction of sublingual abscess.
When, under the tongue, a swelling resembling a small abscess may occur that prevents the natural function of the tongue and perhaps a bone may fill the mouth. The treatment for this is to open the affected person's mouth facing the sun, and examine the swelling.
If you see it resembling white or black pus without any clear opening, do not expose yourself to it as it is cancer. If it is slightly whitish and moist, apply a leech to it gently and squeeze it from all sides.
If bleeding occurs during your treatment, place powdered hemostatic agent on it until the bleeding stops, then resume your treatment to remove it completely. Afterward, cleanse it with salt and vinegar.
Then treat it with all remedies that agree with that until it heals.
Chapter Six and Thirty.
On the treatment and abscess of the two loins.
What grows in the groove from other abscesses may resemble the abscesses that appear externally and are called loins. If treated as described in the sections, it will not escape.
If the abscess is hard like a stone with little sensation, do not apply iron to it, even if it is red in color and its core is thick. Do not apply iron to it, fearing bleeding. Rather, leave it until it heals. Either bind it or let it burst on its own.
If it is white in color and its core is soft, this is what should be cut. The procedure is to examine before the operation if it has settled and the heat of the abscess has subsided or has a slight reduction in some aspects.
Then, the patient should be seated in the sun with his head on a stone and his mouth opened. Take an assistant between your hands and press his tongue down using this instrument with this shape:.
Make it from copper or brass, thin like a scalpel. When you press the tongue with it and the abscess is revealed and your gaze falls upon it, take a probe (sunnarah) and pierce it in the loin and draw it out as far as possible without also drawing any of the surrounding tissue.
Then cut it with this tool, its shape resembles a pair of forceps, except that both ends are sharp and pointed very strongly. It is made from Indian iron or Damascus steel.
Then cut it with this instrument, its shape is like this:.
One edge is sharp and the other is not, so you cut one of the blisters with this type of cut, then after cutting the first one, you cut the second one in the same way. Afterwards, you roll the affected area in cold water or clay and water.
If there is bleeding in front of him, roll it with a solution made from pomegranate rinds or sheep's wool or similar items until the bleeding stops, and then treat it until it heals. It may develop ulcers other than the blisters; in that case, you should cut them as described for the blisters regardless of their location.
A woman had a tumor that had developed inside her rectum, causing slight discomfort and threatened to block the passageway. The woman was finding it difficult to breathe and was unable to eat or drink water.
The translation is: And it had become near to death if I had remained for a day or two, and the worm had risen from him up to my nostrils. Then I drew out with the needle, and when I pricked one of them, I pulled out a piece that was good.
And I cut it where I found it from the nostril, then I did that with what had come out from the other nostril. Then I opened its mouth and compressed its tongue. Then I pricked the worm with a needle and cut off a part of it, but no more blood came out except flowing blood.
The woman departed, and I drew from her time to drink water. Then she was able to eat, but we did not cut off the worm repeatedly for a long time, and the worm remained behind what was being cut until it grew long with that.
The worm was removed from the woman's nose and stopped growing. Then she departed, and I did not know what Allah did with her after that.
Chapter Seven and Thirty.
Treatment of the worms in women.
If the anus is affected and it swells and becomes white and long, it is called a piles (udara) if it is hard below and winding, it is called a worm. If treated as described in the previous section, the treatment does not succeed.
If you feel a hot worm has settled in it (the wound), and it is tender, it should be cut out. If there is any cluster of it persisting stubbornly, and it does not have length, and it is bloody or colored like the color, or black, or there is no sensation in it, it should be avoided to cut it.
If you feel something on the lesion, if it is as described (by its whiteness and length), the lesion should be pressed with a glass and squeezed using the instrument that I have previously described, then the blister should be pierced in the pouch.
Draw it down and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the cutting of the lesions, and it should not be cut from it except what adds to the natural matter without any excess, as if you have cut more from it, you would have harmed by sound and speech.
After cutting, use what was described in the cutting of lesions and treat it until it heals, for if the pus of the lesion comes out after cutting, it should be treated with a probe without fear or worry, and face the probe towards it, for it is the sharp medicine, and it is to put the head of the probe on the stone.
Then, press the tongue with the tool we mentioned earlier, then take from sharp water as I described in the chapter on cauterization, and knead it with it until it is neither too hot nor too cold. Fill this instrument with it, here is its image:.
One side of it (the instrument) where the medicine is placed has a hollow like a scoop measure, and the instrument is put on the wound with the medicine inside while the handle lies flat on its side to prevent any liquid from escaping out of the hole in case anything detrimental is in it.
Then hold the medicine with your hand and grind it on the wound for about half an hour until it turns black and settles, if you wish to take a small piece of cotton, dip it in the medicine.
Put the cotton in the probe and insert it into the wound until the cotton sticks to the wound, repeat this process until you achieve the desired amount of cauterization. Leave it for three or four days, if you find that the cauterization has not been sufficient, reapply the medicine.
After cauterization, clean the wound with a cotton swab dipped in oil and gently remove any remaining medicine. Then rinse it with cold water and treat from outside with ointments and from inside with suppositories until it heals, this type of treatment is less painful and further from fear.
The excerpt reads: "Also, the lacerations are treated with mild substances and incisions are treated with cautery. One should apply wool, zufa, scaeter, saadab, shieh, bawanj, qeysum, and similar materials from plants to it, or some of them, in a quantity, then cover it up in the skin.
The laceration should be treated with a tool that is heated on this type, which is made of silver or copper, placed in the middle and covered, with the incision remaining uncovered.
The excerpt reads: "The one who has a fistula in the mouth, lets boiling oil enter it until it reaches the laceration through the tube, so that the laceration heals well. However, do not perform this treatment for the first occurrence of the wound.
If the wound and the fistula recur frequently, it is often necessary to do this, but only when the wound is inflamed and painful. However, if the tool mentioned earlier is not available, then take a reed with an eggshell wrapped around its tip so that it does not burn the mouth of the patient.
The reason the eggshell prevents the boiling oil from burning the mouth and this is good for the treatment with safety.
Chapter the Eighth and Thirtieth.
On the extraction of splinters and foreign bodies found in incisions other than that.
Frequently, bone or splinters of iron or other material may appear in incisions. It is necessary to extract what is visible after the tongue has been compressed with an instrument under the sun.
In order to clarify what is in the incision, and what has not appeared to you, it is necessary to block the path before food enters into the intestine; otherwise, the foreign body may come out with the evacuation or the intestine might be injured by a sharp piece of the blocking instrument.
Or, a piece of dry bread or a piece of soft sea sponge is inserted and tied with thread; then it is evacuated. When it reaches the location of the splinter, quickly pull the thread to perform this action repeatedly.
Frequently, the splinter or bone adheres to it and is not extracted, unless as mentioned earlier; in such a case, an instrument made of lead (as shown here) is used:
The tip of the instrument should be slightly harder than the lead and have a cavity into which the blocking agent is inserted in the incision along with it; its handle is raised to above, and it is held carefully to avoid causing pain and it pushes the bone or splinter, or the physician may insert it with his hand.
The probe should be inserted to learn the location of the foreign body and it should be pushed down or pulled by the instrument according to its condition until it comes out.
The ninth and thirty-second chapter.
On the extraction of a foreign thread in incision.
If the foreign thread is treated as described in the section on treatment with drugs and it does not improve, look at this: after squeezing the probe with the instrument you have described in sunlight.
If a foreign thread enters your sight, pull it gently with a small snare or a fine plier. If it does not come out, take a thin, stiff tube and insert it near the foreign thread. Then, insert hot iron into the tube until it touches the foreign thread.
Do this repeatedly until the probe remains dry for a day, then take an ice-filled syringe and open its mouth in it. Move the water around without releasing any drops and move the water when he is not holding it.
The foreign thread will fall to the spot if you feel it with water, but if it does not come out as described, burn the probe with fire and do it repeatedly until it falls.
The purpose of drilling in a bone is to take a cavity in it, heat a drill with fire and cover the drill's end with a socket in its middle. Then assemble it in that socket, let the drill receive the bone and place the handle so it is at the end of the pipe. Close it so that the bone does not exit, except to know when the drill has reached the marrow.
When the bone is drilled, if it does not fall off, then the drill must be repeated several times and the handle must endure the heat, and eat salt and garlic and drink no water. Therefore, with this arrangement, it will surely exit. This is an image of a machine that attracts the marrow from the bone if it comes into contact with it.
It is similar to a gimlet, except that it has this tip which enters the bone and its sides resemble the beak of a bird with a cooling channel inside it so that when it comes into contact with something, it does not leave it.
Another tool presses the tongue, and it is a wide drill made of iron with a length that can span the mouth above the tongue. It enters the mouth standing on one side and keeps the mouth open involuntarily without the handle being able to be pressed by teeth until it is released.
Characteristics of the instrument that opens the mouth on this scale with his eyes.
The Forty Chapter.
To make a ligation in the throat and break it.
The types of the throat are numerous and vary according to what is mentioned about them in this book, and they differ in their shape and size from two perspectives. One of these types is the abscess within itself without any pus accumulation.
The second type, in locations where the body occurs, because the worm happening in the head is not the same as the worm happening in the joints, and the worm happening in a location with meat is not the same as the worm happening in a sinew for each of them there is a ruling on treatment.
From the worms, it is not advisable to bind them except after the pus has opened in it and completed, and from them some should be bound, which did not complete its opening like the worms that are near the joints.
Because if a worm happens near a joint and its condition prolongs until what surrounds it subsides, perhaps the binding or the instrument of that joint will become a cause for prolonging the time of that limb, or the worm is near a bone of the head.
Because if you postpone its binding until it opens, you harm that head limb or it is near a joint; bind it intentionally and it is necessary to bind the worm intentionally rather than completely when it has not completed its opening near a joint, lest the pus enters into the joint which will become an abscess.
It becomes necessary, and it is necessary to learn the time of binding the worms that have opened completely when the pain of the worm subsides and the swelling disappears, loss of redness, and the appearance of pustules and narrowing of the worm's head and other signs.
It is preferable to place the pus in a lower location than the abscess if possible, as it makes drainage easier towards below or in a more favorable position than the abscess and increases its flow. The pus should be moving along the body if the abscesses are near the hands and legs.
Body parts and channels, veins, nerves, and joints in general are all on the same level without exception, except those that protrude. In case of abscesses in fleshy areas, it is best to leave the pus.
Until the pus is properly discharged, you should gently massage it as we have said, to expel the accumulated fluid and inflammation, and possibly to soften and open its hardened or closed abscess. Some abscesses may need to be discharged along the body when necessary, or as required by the affected area.
It is advisable to use a single lancet for small abscesses and a wider or multiple lancets for larger ones, depending on the size of the abscess. Some abscesses may need to be squeezed hard enough to break the skin and become like a carbuncle if it has already become so.
It became, to a certain extent, like that which often occurs in dungeons and alleys, of which some has a three-cornered shape, and from it, a part resembling an aspen leaf, cuts off.
That which has a directional or crescent-shaped crack, and similar types of cracks, if it does not have a resembling the scabby ulcers with flat bases, it should be gently pressed with simple pressure only. If the worm is large and has been there for a long period, and the pressing does not make it emerge, all the pus comes out in that time.
Remove part of it first, then let the worm harden for a day, then remove some pus as well. Repeat this gradually until all the pus comes out.
If the cause of the sickness is weak strength, or a woman who is pregnant, or a small child, or an old man in a trance, animal spirits often do not dissipate with the removal of pus in a single discharge; therefore, beware of this matter very much.
After pressing these ulcers, it is necessary to clean the wound and observe if the wound of the worm is small or the crack is simple, use cotton wool or wool from the cat's paw, if the worm is large and the cracks are numerous.
It is necessary to enter every cavity of an abscess until they connect with each other, even if the worm has been cut off from the skin or confined in it. It is necessary to pack it with linen wool or dry catgut until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with whatever is appropriate for the wound until it heals. If a flow of blood appears during your procedure, use cold water and chalk after you drink them, then place a piece of cotton on the wound several times.
If the bleeding continues, it is necessary to apply treatment and the methods we have described in many parts of our book and division. If you are during cold weather and the place of the worm is large swollen, it is necessary to rub with hot oil or fat.
Place it on the location, and if you are in summer and the locations are hot, apply the poultices with cold water or wine, or with cold oil or fat until the third day as we have mentioned before, so that the worm may dissolve and be removed.
Use whatever is suitable for the treatment until it heals, and this is all that needs to be known about the treatment of abscesses in general, as for the method of division, we have mentioned in detail how to treat each abscess separately.
Chapter one, forty-one.
In the incision on abscesses that appear on the skin of the head.
Small abscesses on the skin of the head, one of the types that contain pus, resemble a chicken's bladder and have many types, such as shahmiyyah and those containing moisture similar to puss.
From it (the body) comes that which contains moisture similar to pus and boils, and suchlike, and from it comes that which is hard, solid and brittle, and all of it lacks danger in breaking it or extracting it without causing harm to the nerves.
The work is to prick it (the hard, solid and brittle part) first with the tool that comes after this, which is called the lancet, until you learn what it contains. If what it contains is moisture, then break it by a simple long break on this shape:.
Start breaking from line ~b~ to line ~j~, if the moisture comes out, break the container that contained that moisture and cut it all off and do not leave any trace of the box because it often returns if something remains.
Then immerse a cotton in the pickle, if it is available; otherwise, in saline water and fill the wound with it and leave it until the next day because it consumes what remains of the container. Then make another cotton with the pickle again if necessary.
Until you are sure that nothing remains from the container, then treat the wound with the pickle until it heals, and if there is a boil containing harmful matter, break it on this shape:.
Break it open gently and extract the small bones that are inside the wound in both eyes, and exert your effort in removing the splinter that contains it. If the pain resists you, do as I have previously described to you, and likewise do so in the abscess if it is hardened from the break.
The treatment for one eye is as you have mentioned, and breaking in the hardened abscess is easier because there is less blood and moisture involved. Some of these abscesses that occur on the forehead in some people do not contain pus with them. This is due to the fact that the abscess was broken open for a different reason.
The abscess on the head of an old woman was as hard as a stone, rough and white, and could not be broken even when struck, and none of the other abscesses that occur on the head were like these abscesses that commonly appear on children's heads.
When the earaches first occur, break each of them gently and create an opening at the base to facilitate the flow of fluid out of it, then treat it with the appropriate treatment.
The Second and Forty-Fourth Sections.
Abscesses occur frequently on monkeys in the neck, and these abscesses also occur under the armpits and at the back of the legs, and they can occur all over the body, but the one that occurs in the neck is usually one, while there are many of them, and some of them may originate from each other.
Every camel has a specific sheath within it, as is the case with animals and head ulcers as we have described, and these kinds of camels are numerous; some of them are hard-shelled, others contain moisture, and there are some that are harmful and do not respond to treatment.
If you found it good in touch and its appearance was close to the color of skin, it would move to all sides without being tight around the neck or shoulders or arms and legs, and it did not show any changes. It should be cut with a simple incision from above to below the body in this shape from line ~j~ to line ~b~.
Cut it from all sides and pull the skin with a snare or two or several snares if necessary as we have mentioned in head ulcers, and remove it little by little without cutting arteries or veins, and let the ligature not be too tight.
Avoid cutting more than necessary or harming the patient, so cut only what is necessary; if you cut arteries or veins and your hand slips and you are unable to perform the operation, place it in the wound with powder or some of the herbs that stop bleeding.
The incision is made and left until the suppuration of the abscess occurs, then the incision heals over and becomes blocked. If the blood stops at that point, return to your work until it recedes. Then probe with your finger if anything remains, and if you find any small worms, cut them out and clean them.
If there is a large worm in the abscess, it should not be cut out from its source but should be tied with a strong and clean thread and left until it comes out on its own without causing harm. Then the incision is to be filled with cotton wool dipped in the Mummy liniment (Egyptian ointment) and treated.
If the entire worm is cut out, it should be necessary to gather up the edges of the wound and tie it with a suture after confirming that there remains no remnant of the pus. If you see that it has remained, then it indicates that a portion of the worm's body is left in the bone.
It should be aimed at cutting the root and marrow, using suturing as mentioned before, and if any worms are present with moisture, tie them up with a simple cloth so that you can see the place of their exit. Make the cloth lie above the area as previously described.
Then, after the pustule of the fistula, apply Egyptian mummies or similar for it to consume what remains of corruption until you see the wound has been cleaned. If so, treat it with healing ointments for meat until it heals.
The third and forty-fourth chapter.
In the fissure of the stone, a condition occurring inside the cavity.
The early people mentioned this fissure in the stone, but I have never seen anyone in our country make it and this is their speech. As for the butchers, it is necessary that they avoid the fissure of the stone as it does not benefit them.
For all cavities and roots to be sunken, and as for those who have a hot abscess in the mouth or cavity or jaw, if it is not an abscess in the throat, it is necessary to apply the fissure of the stone to escape from the swelling which may be caused by the inflammation.
It is necessary that if we wish to do this, we make a fissure in the stone beneath three circles of the throat or four small fissures between two circles, with the size of a fissure in the index finger and not in the thumb. This position is suitable for the fissure.
Since it has no flesh and the veins are distant, if the patient is a scrotum, it is necessary to incise the skin with a lancet, then burn the skin until it reaches the capsule where he can see anything.
Then burn the incision we described, and it implies burning the capsule from the tissue that comes out with what is being cut, and after the sound stops and a wound remains open for some time, if the fear of infection persists, gather the edges of the wound from the skin.
And mark it off neatly without excess, then apply the medicine that causes the flesh to heal. He said this book is a commentary on this statement we quoted: if they saw that the cause had blocked the incision of one of these abscesses (which they mentioned).
The excerpt reads: "Al-'Alyal perishes with death, and he himself desires that his artery be cut. They went to the mouth of the rock. The 'Alyal breathed on the wound site with some breaths and surrendered from death. They only commanded him to leave the wound open until the disease chapter subsides and it becomes its third day.
"Then they commanded the wound to be sutured and treated until it is healed, which I myself had witnessed that they took sharp scissors and sent him for its cutting, whereupon they cut a piece of the skull with it. They then called me for its treatment, and found it to be rotten like a wound would be. Thus, I discovered the wound.
"I found the blood that came out from the wound to be flowing freely, so I was certain that no artery or vein had been cut and only air came out of the wound. Thus, I cauterized it and treated it until it healed, and the patient did not expose himself to anything but a groan in his voice, nothing more.
"She returned to her normal condition after several days, from which we say that the mouth of the rock is safe.
"The fourth and forty-fourth section.
"In the mouth of the ulcer that appears in the glans penis, which is known as the fissure of the glans.
This is the abscess known as scrotal carbuncle, it is a large tumor on the skin color and it is common in women. It comes in two types.
It can either be natural or acquired, for the natural one there is no remedy, but for the acquired one it will be on two types, the first resembling pieces of camphor and the second resembling an abscess that originates from a fistula, and in its hole there is danger. It is not permissible to touch it with a hot iron unless it has been incised and drained with the lancet, if it has not been connected to any veins, then pierce it as one would pierce camphor, without causing bleeding. Extract it with what contains it if it is in a cyst, otherwise squeeze out all its contents then treat the area as necessary.
The fifth and forty-fourth section.
In the cavity of various sores (or camphor).
The difference between sores and abscesses, as it is a problem, for I say that the abscess will have heat, swelling, and painful areas until it breaks open and releases pus. The wound completes when maggots and pus settle, but it should not be accompanied by heat, pus, or wounds. It is wrapped in a silk-woven [casing], which has a special container; it should be of the color of the body, and its beginning resembles cheese, becoming like leather, growing larger or smaller.
It is of two types, either it is cheesy or it contains moisture and the colors of moisture are numerous as mentioned in the classification; if you come to treat the maggot, it should first be drained and examined with the instrument called al-mudass upon its appearance in the opening that follows this.
The size of the worm's bone, then extract al-mudass and observe what comes out as a result of it; if moisture is expelled, note its color, then crack it simply as mentioned in other worms, but if no moisture comes out after using al-mudass, know that it is cheesy.
Crack it gently in this shape as you are aware, then attach it to the scissors and cut the skin from all sides with a knife, then preserve it in a container if possible to extract it with the maggot correctly.
If the incision occurs during operation and it cannot be correctly extracted, it often exposes that. Extract it piece by piece until there remains nothing of it. If something remains of it, whether little or much, repeat the procedure on the matter which requires it most.
If it [the wound] is deep and something remains of it that is easy, make the wound narrow by using sharp, pointed instruments and close it tightly with what can soothe the inflammation and heal it until it heals over, if the wound is large then, use sutures to sew it and heal it.
If an arrow, whether blunt or sharp, penetrates you and blood flows out, apply hot ashes to the wound and keep it closed for one or two days until the wound heals and the bleeding stops, then return to cutting whatever remains of the injury.

In Images of Tools.
The three types of images depicting instruments for cutting and scraping are large, medium, and small in size.
Large Instrument Image:.
Medium-sized Instrument Image:.
Image of small cautery.
Made from iron with steel-tipped ends for quick entry into abscesses, and these are images of cauteries called the brand and they come in three types, large, medium, and small; image of a large cautery.
Image of medium cautery.
Image of small cautery.
Repairs abscesses, surgeries, wounds, and cavities filled with bones or other substances; made of copper-zinc alloys such as brass, silver, iron, gold or electrum. The best are those made of electroplate.
Cauteries can also be made from black lead and are used to stop bleeding in wounds that have swelling inside; there are three types: long, medium, and short.
According to the size and capacity of each wound, every cautery has its own length and thickness; image of a large lead cautery.
Image of medium lead cautery.
Image of small lead cautery.
Images of Scannaries are numerous, as some are simple with a single curve and there are three major types: large, medium, and small. Among them are the scannaries for dogs, which also have three types, including the scannaries with multiple curves, and there are three types of scannaries that are curved. There are three types among them, and one of these types is the scannary with three curves, and there are three types of this kind, and all of these types need to be in their respective places. Here's a picture of a large simple scannary: Here's a picture of a central simple scannary: Here's a picture of a small simple scannary:
Here's a picture of a large canine scannary: Image of Scannara for Extraction of Tooth in Middle.

These are the forceps that are used for squeezing and breaking bones, and they come in three types because some are large, others medium, and some small. Image of Large Forceps.
Image of Medium Forceps.
Image of Small Forceps.
The blades of the forceps are limited at the front while the sides are not, which was made to avoid cutting nerves or veins when crushing bones, and it is easier to handle with less pain compared to the heat felt during the extraction of a worm.
These are the extractors which come in three types because some are large, others medium, and some small. Image of Large Extractor.

Figures of the Amputations that cut Blood Flux and they come in Three Types as there is Large, Medium, and Small, Figure of a Large Amputation:
Made of copper or zinc, turned slightly longer as you see and shaped like a needle, these types of fractures should be big and small for you to cut with them quickly in case of necessity and when no medicine is available. [This appears to be a description or instruction on the use of the fracture tools mentioned earlier.]
But do not use it for cutting blood in all parts of the body, rather it is used in fleshy areas such as the arm, thigh, finger, abdomen, and nearby organs or soft, moist body parts. [This appears to be an explanation or caution regarding the use of the fracture tools.]
And they can be made into smaller devices resembling nutcrackers, as shown in this image: [This appears to be a description or explanation of additional uses for the fracture tools.]
It cuts blood if it escapes from the vein or when cutting arteries, and they can be made into needles as shown in this image: [This appears to be a description or explanation of additional uses for the fracture tools.]
The Seventh Chapter and Forty-Fourth: [This appears to be a chapter title in Albucasis' 10th-century Arabic textbook on surgery.]
In the scrotum of male patients: [This appears to be a section title or label for a specific topic within the textbook.]
A swelling resembling the female breast may occur in some people due to excessive dreaming until it becomes similar to a woman's breast, remaining unpleasant. Anyone who dislikes this should scrape the affected area with a lunar-shaped scraper in this manner.
A line starting from point B to point J:. Then cut the flesh entirely, then fill the wound with a healing ointment, then stitch up the wound with thread and treat it until it heals. The underarm should be left open to expose the bone as is customary for women.
It is necessary to scrape the sides in an oval shape, similar to crescents, with each one connected at their ends until the larger one forms a circle around the smaller ones on this figure:. Then scrape the skin that is between the two lines, remove the flesh, use what we have described for stitching and bandaging, and apply whatever treatment it requires until it heals.
If you do not remove what is required to be cut for the purpose of cauterization or before bleeding occurs, it is necessary to fill the wound with treated cotton in a sutured dressing and leave it until it consumes the remaining flesh, then treat it until it heals completely.
The Eighty-Fourth Section.
In the abscesses that are under the testicles.
These abscesses that are under the testicles belong to the type of hard, round abscesses which have a membrane containing pus. If it does not contain any pus, it is necessary to make an incision in this manner.
From line ~b~ to line ~j~, if all the contents of the abscess have drained out over time, pack it with sterile cotton and leave it for a day, then remove the cotton.
Treat with the appropriate treatment until it heals completely, for if the abscess is of the type of hard knot-like abscess, make an incision as we have mentioned earlier in the incision on abscesses, and if the wound is not healing properly until the pus appears, use the ligation as described previously.
The Ninetieth Section.
In the abscess caused by a boil or a hemorrhoid, it is called an Anurismas.
If the boil or the subcutaneous fat above it is cut, it often causes an abscess and also an abscess caused by a hemorrhoid. Furthermore, it may cause an abscess to fill with air.
The signs that indicate whether the abscess and gas are due to boils or hemorrhoids are as follows: if the abscess is due to a boil, it will be long and accumulated in the body's depth and when you press the abscess with your finger, it feels like a bladder.
If the abscess is due to a hemorrhoid, the abscess will be linear on the surface of the body. The incision on these abscesses is dangerous and especially in the navel, armpit, neck, and in many other parts of the body, it was very severe. Therefore, treatment with iron should be avoided.
Furthermore, if it is on the sides or on the head, it should be avoided. If it is due to an abscess caused by a boil, the incision should be made in the skin lengthwise, then the abscess should be opened with scissors, and the boil should be cut off and removed from the scabs.
until it uncovers then enter underneath it with an iron and carry it over to the other side and tighten the veins with a strong thread in two places where you know them, in the vessels of the two veins that are in the arm pit then insert with the probe until all the blood comes out.
and the boil is opened then the treatment that produces pus is applied until the ligatures fall off then it is treated with balm that agrees with that until it heals.
if the boil is due to a rupture of the vein, then you must grab as much of the boil with your hand along with the skin, then insert an iron below the position where you grabbed and carry it over until it comes out from the other side with a strong thread inside. then tie the boil with a strong ligature as you have been told in the method of ligating an abscess from both sides, if you fear that the threads will slip then insert another iron with another thread under the entire boil where the first iron meets.
tighten the threads in four places then cut open the boil in its center until what is inside comes out, then cut off a portion of the skin and leave what was tied, then place ointment that has been soaked in oil and wine on it. Then apply the treatment that is in the fat and marrow until it softens.
The section number fifty.
In the worm that arises from the scrotum.
As the worm appears in the scrotum and the rectum, similarly it appears in the testis if it occurs due to a blow or due to excessive fatigue or similar, and it is most common in the areas of the genitals and the buttocks.
And in every place where there is movement, it is a creeping worm with color similar to the body and is more often than not without pain, but when pressed strongly, its nature resembles that of an adder, and the worm should not be gathered within the depths of the body.
It is beneath the skin and moves to all sides, it does not go towards the front or the back, so it should not be exposed to iron because it might cause time loss, and if it is in the neck or the head, it should not be exposed.
Cut the skin with a scalpel, if the worm is small, grab it with forceps and cut it from its origin, but if it is large, tie it with a thread, break it, then remove it, gather the wound with stitching and treat until it heals.
Chapter One: Fifty-One.
On the amputation of the fingers which occur in the abdomen.
In many people, fingers (Fractures) may occur in the abdomen and other organs called 'al-fitriyyah' as they resemble the palm. The fracture is thin at its base and thick towards its tip, which can cause swelling of the eye and form small or large growths.
I have seen a man with two scrota resembling normal ones, there was no noticeable difference in color or texture. The testicles of both had continuously leaked fluid. I cut them and weighed one around eighteen ounces and the other around six.
In case the organ is wet and the scrota are white, soft, thin in texture, cut it with a broad blade and place the pieces carefully into hot coals as they may spew out much blood upon cutting.
If blood flows excessively, tie the testicles with a strong wire and leave them for a couple of days, then tighten the wire further so that the wire does not loosen.
Whenever the scrotum feels hard, be careful in cutting it for fear and caution, especially if there is no abdominal cavity but it may be possible to cut half or part of it.
Then tie it to prevent recurrence, and treat it until the wound heals, but beware of cutting scrota that appear pale in color and have a bluish tinge, for it is a tumor or cancer and will come with the mention of cancer afterwards.
Chapter Two: Fifty-Six.
Treatment of anal fistula.
Anal fistula is due to various causes: either the rupture of the rectum from which feces or gas passes, or bleeding from veins or arteries, or a gas buildup.
If it is due to the rupture of the rectum and the passage of feces, its color will be similar to that of pus and it will be watery without pain, and its appearance will vary. If it is due to the passage of gas, its appearance will vary greatly, if you press on it, it disappears and then returns, possibly accompanied by a hard lump and severe pain upon entering the bathroom and fatigue, if it is due to moisture, it will be watery.
It does not disappear if you press on it, nor increase nor decrease, if it is due to bleeding, with these symptoms, the pus appears black, if it is due to meat, the pus will be thick and hard, remaining in one place.
If it is due to gas, its examination shows that the anal fistula is due to bleeding from veins or arteries, it is necessary to abstain from treatment as there is fear and danger, as you know in the chapter about abscesses which occur due to veins and arteries.
If the anus is prolapsed either by a wound or a hemorrhoid, it is necessary for the patient to be ordered to restrain himself and stand still, then learn to massage the whole area around it. Then order him to push it between your hands onto its surface, then rub around the anus at the location you taught massage, then draw the worm (prolapsed tissue) upwards with a large forceps, then tie the place of the rub with a strong cord or silk thread securely.
The knot of the cord should be loose, then open the prolapsed tissue that is tied above the cord and enter it with your index finger. If you find a wound, the cord will have caught it, stop the movements and push the wound into the abdomen. If there is hemorrhoid, draw it out with forceps.
Cut off the excess, if he resists or screams, bind him gently and return to your work. Take two strong cords and put them into the stitches you made around the wound. The cords should then be tied tightly around the prolapse in four places on the forceps.
If you wish to remove the cataract, leave it until the surrounding meat softens and falls off by itself or cuts it if it hardens and softens, then treat it with what is appropriate for cauterization until it heals, for if it is a secretion of flesh in it.
If there is moisture, it is necessary to cauterize the wound as we have said and draw out the blood or the moisture found in it, then treat the area with what heals the place.
The third and fiftieth section.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification that there are different types of cancer and the path to its treatment with medicines and the warning against treating it with iron lest it causes harm, and we have mentioned the cancer that originates in the breast and the caution against its treatment.
It is mentioned in the beginning that when cancer is in a place where it can be entirely excised, such as cancer that may occur in the arm or leg and surrounding limbs, it should be removed completely. But it is not appropriate to approach it if it has started small and grown large.
I have not been able to heal it, and no one before me has had success in treating it, and this is what reached me. The treatment is carried out if it can be done as we said by advancing [the procedure] to make the dark spots disappear then evacuate it if it is in the veins filled with blood.
Then place the patient (in a position) that allows for work, then he will receive in the cancerous ulcers those which are suitable for him. Then tie it from all sides with the skin, pulling tightly until nothing remains of its roots, and leave the blood to flow without cutting it quickly.
Then grasp the vessels (or arteries) and veins with your hand or whatever tools you have at your disposal, as it may resist during the operation, causing heavy bleeding from cuts or ruptures. In such cases, apply pressure to stop the bleeding until it ceases, then treat him with all available remedies until he recovers.
The fourth and fiftieth chapter.
On the treatment of abscesses.
We have been informed regarding the classification of abscesses and how water collects in them, as well as indications for each type and treatment with medicines; that which is treated with iron is only the purulent type, and it should not be treated with iron the purulent, phlegmonous or suppurative types.
If this is the case, it is a conflict; if you have treated this type of abscess with medication and it has not been successful, look to see if the patient has become weak or has another disease other than the abscess, such as being in a state of debilitation or illness.
Treatment of a fracture or dislocation, and similar conditions: If it is your duty to treat it with iron, then know that it has gaped open. If you see the bone protruding and strong in power, it does not have any disease other than the fracture itself, and it is neither a child nor an old man. In this case, the work should be done by setting the bone and standing between your hands. Assisting behind it, he presses the abdomen with his hand and forces the water down towards the affected side. Then, take a pointed probe on this image:
Restricted to two long points, defined at the tip like a probe, except that there is a little softness in it so as not to penetrate into the abdomen during the work, thus causing damage. Then observe whether the fracture originates from the side of the abdomen.
The fracture should be separated from the abdomen by about three fingers below the navel, for if the fracture originates from a disease of the kidney, then your incision will be easier on that side; if it originates from a disease of the liver, then the fracture will be on the right side by about three fingers.
Also, it is not advisable for the incision to be on the side that the patient wishes to lie on, as this weakens the area; then pierce all of it with the skin-cutting instrument, then introduce the instrument into the incision and lift your hand.
Between the skin and the muscle as if you are cutting it, and the space that is cut becomes a space like a vein or similar, then pierce the muscle until it reaches an empty place, which is the water place, then draw it out and introduce the instrument, which is its image.
It is like a thin tube made from copper, brass or lead with a small hole at its bottom and three holes on two sides and one on the other side as you see it.
And its end may be corked like the tip of a pen on this image:.
On the top of it there is a hole, so that when the instrument reaches the water, if it descends from the animal's anus, it will drain the water moderately at a time, for if you drain too much water in a short time, it may cause the death of the animal.
Or it may have a cover that is near death, but drain from it according to its strength and what you judge by the state of the animal in terms of its vitality and color, then remove the instrument and collect the water and this is because it collects it from a short time.
If the skin around the wound on the finger which was previously cauterized appears swollen, then wait a few days to see if it is likely to be due to that.
Take the soft water container and perform this action for a few days while being cautious and avoiding mistakes, until there remains only the soft water. If you are afraid of the possibility (of infection) and leave much water, then treat it by burying it in hot sand.
Excessive immersion in the bath and sun, patience with drying, treating it with dried medicines until it heals, and care should be taken to prevent inflammation of the limb, bladder, or intestines after the water has been removed as previously described.
The fifth and sixth chapters.
Treatment of children who are born with or have uncircumcised and tight foreskin or not in its proper place.
Some children may be born from the mother's womb and circumcision site not circumcised; in such cases, it is necessary to perform circumcision immediately after birth.
With a very thin string on this image:
Then put a very thin wire made of lead in the wound, tie it and hold it for three or four days until he urinates; then remove it and cleanse it, and if not given lead, it may be possible that the urine that flows over the site will not close.
If a wound is narrow, treat it with a probe repeatedly until it widens. As for one whose wound is not in its proper place, this is because some of them are born with the wound at the end of the rectum, and he cannot defecate near it.
Until he raises his hand above, and there is no passage for semen before the bladder reaches the uterus in a straight position; this is an extremely bad condition, and the method of work in such cases is to draw out the bladder onto the abdominal surface.
Then, push your left hand into his rectum firmly and locate the bladder's head. Cut or pierce its center with a sharp knife or as if you were drilling a hole, so that the wound is similar to the rectum, and the wound occurs in the center where it should be.
And during the procedure, make sure to prevent bleeding as it often occurs. Use something that stops bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
The Sixth and Fifty-Seventh Chapter.
On the bladder that protrudes into the abdominal cavity, rectum, bladder neck, and urethra and causes adhesion between the bladder and the rectum.
This ailment frequently occurs in dissection and it is known as Nototus for fatty tissue of the bowels, and sometimes it can be harmful or not, the latter should be tied with a delicate suture.
It is cut until it is thoroughly purified, then a mummified linen cloth is placed on it, followed by treatment with nux vomica until it discharges. If the ailment is harmful and of a black color, potassium should be used after cutting and burning it.
If the ailment is in an ulcer of the gall bladder and some of the ailment is inside and some outside, it should be removed first from the inside until it discharges, then treated from the outside.
Because when treating both at the same time, the gall bladder is not safe from rupturing, and it may also appear in the female genitalia and gallbladder as dark or rotten spots, all of which should be drained and treated before they rot or have already rotted.
Then honey is applied to it after that, followed by ground long pepper and cinnamon, then treated with other remedies until it discharges. If there is a flow of blood, potassium should be used on this image.
The catheter is useful for both conditions, meaning bleeding and wounding if it ruptures. If the urethra eats it up and carries it away at a time when it should enter the urinary passage, it is necessary that you insert catheters made of lead to evacuate the urine, as for the sealing of the bladder with the catheter.
This sealing happens only in cases where the bladder is intact and there are no ruptures, and sealing it may be caused by injury or a blow. In such a case, it should be punctured with a cannula until the ligature dissolves and the bladder is relieved from all sides.
If the bladder and the surrounding area become difficult to distinguish during sealing, it is necessary to puncture something from the bladder and the surrounding area, as the surrounding tissue is delicate and may be pierced quickly, then separate the bladder and the surrounding tissue with a thin, sharp reed that has been soaked in cold water to prevent adhesion.
Then it is treated with a binding drink until it settles down.
Chapter Seven and Fifty-Seven.
On purification of children and treatment of their errors.
The amputation is not something other than the separation of connections, except that when it was performed by our intention and used specifically in children, it is necessary to draw the best procedure in it.
The easiest way that leads to safety, and I say that the initial steps of amputation are not mentioned in any of their books because it was not used in their laws but rather something we have acquired.
Through experimentation, it was found that the general group of craftsmen and hajjamin used purification with the muss (a type of sticky substance) and the maghseera (a surgical instrument for making an incision), they used the flukha and arbaat (instruments to separate soft tissue) with thread and cut with a saw, I have tried all these methods.
I did not find better than purification with the maghseera and the arbaat (instruments to separate soft tissue) using thread, because purification with the muss often thickens the skin as the skin of the sheath is double-layered, so it may not completely cut through the upper layer of skin, leaving the lower layer behind.
Due to the necessity of completion and unrelenting pain, I found that purification with the flukha was not reliable in cutting the edges of the incision, as it may enter into the wound, and regarding purification with the saw, it often cuts the skin and spoils your work or the child's skin is short by nature...
Often, such wounds do not require purification, and I have seen this myself. As for purifying with the probe and stitching with thread, my experience has shown that it is more suitable because the probe above resembles the knife below.
When you amputate your hand in a similar manner, cutting it at one point and time, the stitching of the thread will be like a wall for the skin from all sides without error in the wound, and the work should be done first with the cautiousness of a novice.
Certainly, it is not for the one who understands a little that you tie the thread only in amputation and let him go afterwards, then make him happy and secretive on all sides so that you can do this with him and whatever he accepts with his mind, then stop him between your hands at shoulder height.
A patient should not sit and keep the probe in his hand or under his foot so that the novice's eye does not touch it nor any of the tools, then your hand enters the amputation and inflates the skin and pulls it up until the head of the amputation comes out.
Then, clean what gathers in it of exudate. Then, bind the affected site with a linen thread, then below it bind another thread slightly, then grasp with your forceps and the assistant's the location of the lower binding strongly, and cut between the threads. Then raise the skin quickly and extract the pustule head, then let blood flow a little as it is best and less harmful for abscess, then clean it with damp pumice stone, then sprinkle upon it from dry camel urine ashes or cinnamon powder, as it is better that I have tried, or volcanic sand, it is also good.
Then raise the skin quickly and extract the pustule head, then let blood flow a little as it is best and less harmful for abscess, then clean it with damp pumice stone, then sprinkle upon it from dry camel urine ashes or cinnamon powder, as it is better that I have tried, or volcanic sand, it is also good. Then, place the sores on a damp pumice stone and scrape an egg white boiled in barley water with pure olive oil and leave it on for the last day, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
This is the image of the brush used for cleaning.
A scalpel should be sharp and smooth, with the length of the blades equal to the size of the tweezers, and as for the error that occurs in cleaning, avoid pulling out all or part of the skin when cutting. Instead, gently push it back with your thumb before it becomes inflamed at the site.
Cut it (the ulcer) flat, if you cannot grab it with your fingers, attract it with a lancet and cut it. It will take him three days, and what is under the edge of the wound will swell and become hot, leave it until the warm sore settles, then break it open.
Cut it according to what suits you, and keep what is under the edge of the wound as it does not harm if something from the edge of the wound is cut off, treat it with whatever alleviates pain from the described sores in our article on sores.
If a part of the skin is cut above the required amount and it shrinks towards the top, this is not harmful also, treat it with what we have mentioned until it heals.
The eighth and fiftieth section.
In the treatment of a blocked urine in the bladder.
A blocked urine in the bladder is due to obstruction by a stone, blood clot, pus or flesh like that, if it is treated with what we have mentioned in the section on cautery treatment, there are risks associated with it.
If urine has not been released and you suspect it is blocked by a stone in the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be made to lie on his back, then a man should stand on his stomach and push his abdomen towards his chest while holding himself.
When a stone is pressed at the neck of the bladder, it is pushed towards evacuation, causing urination. If this does not occur as described earlier and the condition worsens on the patient, then extraction by means of the instrument called Katharyr (which resembles its image below) should be performed.
It is made of copper and is thin, curved like the beak of a bird in a long narrow handle, about half a span in length, with soft leather at its tip. On one end it has an opening for urine to flow through, which can be secured with a thread or cord tightly tied around it.
The end of the thread is inserted into the Katharyr and pulled back firmly to push something from the cord into the tube, then the Katharyr is anointed with oil or zabd (a type of ointment) or white egg yolk, and the patient is placed on a chair.
The bladder and the instrument are lubricated with warm water, oil or soap, then the Katharyr is inserted into the bladder along with a long flexible tube until it reaches the source of the blockage, then the bladder is stretched upward towards the abdomen, and the Katharyr is pushed inside.
Until the probe has been fully inserted, then forceps are pushed inside until it approaches closely to the bladder, causing the male to incline downward and the forceps within him, then push it until it reaches the cyst and he feels something empty.
This is done at this level because the urethra which carries urine has a deviation, then the thread is pulled through the sheath with some force as urine follows the sheath, then it is removed and the urine escapes, and the forceps are returned.
Continue to do that until the cyst is emptied and the patient feels relieved.
The Ninth and Fiftieth Section.
How to puncture the cyst with a needle.
The pictures of the tools that are suitable for this purpose are made of copper or brass with a long tube attached to a handle and a hollow needle at its tip. This is done with an instrument known as a lancet, and here is its image:.
Made of copper or brass with a long tube, attached to a handle shaped like a screw, but the tip is hollow and three holes are made in it; two from one side and one from another as you can see.
The hollow place, wherein the festering boils are, should be filled up to its capacity without exceeding, until it draws in moisture; if it expels, it should push outwards as much as pain allows, for oil is used in naval battles at sea.
If you want to discharge pus from a boil, insert the edge of the cupping glass into the pus and draw the cup upward so that the pus is drawn into the hollow of the cupping glass, then insert its edge into the incision as described in our text on cupping, and then expel the pus with the cup.
These pus will reach the boil at its location until it feels tender, and this is a gentle and effective way to lance the boil:.
Make from silver or lead a tool with a handle resembling a small broom and underneath it there is a loop where the cord is placed, then take a lancet and put in it the pus that you want to lance the boil with, then tie the lancet tightly between the loops of the cord using a strong thread.
Heat the pus slightly over the fire, then insert the edge of the lancet into the incision and press firmly with your hand on the boil using the pus until it feels tender, indicating that the pus has reached the boil.
If mucus is not present, take a piece of linen and make a circle from it, then puncture it all around. Pass a thread through the holes as it rotates. Gather the circle like a purse after placing in it whatever moistening agents, ointments, and water you desire.
Then tie it in the machine and use it as you would with mucus, squeezing it by hand until moisture reaches the mucus.
The sixth section.
On the removal of stones.
We have previously mentioned the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and we pointed out the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, and their signs. We also mentioned the stone that requires manual removal using fingers and forceps.
The stone formed in the bladder is specific, and it appears in the urethra. I will describe this in detail and briefly.
I say that the stone formed in the bladder is more susceptible to infection, and one of its signs is that urine resembles water in color.
It appears as gravel and is hard to feel, and it often spreads and causes pain in many places, making infection easy to reach up to ten years old, and it becomes more difficult in the elderly. As for children, it is moderate between these two extremes.
The larger the stone, the easier its treatment, and the smaller ones, opposite of that. When approaching treatment, it is first necessary to draw out all the pus that is in it, as it may prevent the discovery of the stone during examination.
Then, the instrument is taken and turned downwards to make the stone descend into the mouth of the bladder or it is lifted from a high position several times, then it is seated between your hands with its handle below and its head above. You hold it in place, allowing the bladder to empty completely, then examine it.
After removing it from outside, if you feel the stone in the cavity, make an incision on it as soon as possible. If it does not sink when touched with the forceps, it is necessary to rub the surrounding area with oil from the left hand, if the instrument is young or the middle finger.
If the boy is healthy, place him in his seat and examine for the stone until it is under your finger. Then gently move it a little at a time towards the neck of the bladder. After that, press on it with your finger and push it out towards the desired location.
Command the servant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to spread the woman's thighs towards above, while the other servant pulls the skin beneath the thighs away from the location of the tear. Then take the probing hook as shown in this picture.
Press a small incision between the chair and the woman's thighs, not in the middle but towards the left hip, so that the tear is on the same stone. Place your finger in the chair and press it outwards to make the tear wide outside and narrow inside, just enough for the stone to come out.
Do not press too hard with the finger that is in the chair on the stone during the tear, for it may come out easily without difficulty. Note that it may be a stone with corners and letters, which makes its removal difficult.
From it (the surgery), there is a prolapsed thing resembling a bladder, which can be easily extracted. If it has no rings or letters within it, add a little more incision, so if it does not come out like this, then it should be compressed on it with a firm forceps, the tip of which is like that of a pincer.
To press on the bladder stone so that it does not slip away, or to insert a delicate, blunt instrument under it, with its tip curved, if you are unable to do so, then increase the incision slightly. If blood comes out of anything, cut it with scissors.
If there are more than one, press the large one towards the bladder mouth first, then incise it. After that, push out the smaller ones and do the same if there are more than two. If it is very large, then it is not appropriate to make a deep incision because it exposes one of two risks.
Either it may cause death, or it may lead to permanent impotence due to the fact that it cannot be held in place but try to push it out until it comes out or breaks into pieces with forceps until it comes out in pieces.
If your work is completed, cauterize the wound with fire, endure, press and suture, then apply a blister of warm oil or fat, cold water, and let it sit to prevent the heat of the worm. Then, when the blister has formed, apply a plaster on top for three days.
If the wound and worm are exposed, wash it abundantly with warm water, then treat it with the leech and the bloodsucking leeches until it has healed. If a hot worm appears in the wound, eats and behaves like blood accumulating in the bladder and refusing to urinate, this can be known from the excretion of blood along with urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and draw out that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to the corruption of the bladder and its weakening. Then wash the wound with salt water and fresh water, suitable for all types of treatment until it heals.
It is necessary in all treatment times to tie the veins and gather them together to hold the medicine that is placed on the site, for if the abscess is small and has formed on the urethra and leaked into it, preventing urine from exiting, treat it as I have described before it becomes worse.
"I often prefer this treatment for fractures, and I have tried it myself. It is to take a splint made of iron wire which should be shaped as follows.
"The tip of the splint should be pointed and bent like a hook, then take some thread and tie it to the rod beneath the fracture so that it does not return to its original position. Then insert the iron splint into the fracture until it reaches the same level as the fracture.
"Gently move the splint within the fracture with your hand, and you will feel it penetrating through the other side. Then urine will flow from that side. Keep your hand on what remains of the fracture outside the rod, as it will expand and come out with the urine, and the broken bone will heal.
"If this treatment does not help in healing your fracture, tie a thread beneath the fracture and another one above it, then break the thread at the fracture site within the same rod. Then remove it.
"Then untie the thread and clean the clotted blood that has formed in the wound. It is necessary to tie a thread beneath the fracture so that it does not return to its original position, and tie another one from above, so that when the thread is untied after the removal of the splint, the skin covers the wound.
Therefore, if you tie the upper thread, raise the skin above so it recedes with your gap and covers the wound as we have mentioned.
The First and Seventh [Section].
On the Removal of Stones in Women.
Very rarely are stones found in women, and if a stone is discovered in one of them, it makes her treatment difficult and prevents many from allowing their woman to be examined by a physician. The first is that she may have been fasting, and the second is that you will not find a woman who permits herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is pure or of the prohibited class, and the third is that you will not find a woman skilled in this art nor is it usual to work with hands, and the fourth is that the incision for the stone is far from its location, requiring an additional incision.
In such a case, it is risky, so if necessity requires it, then a skilled female physician must be taken, as rarely are they found. If she cannot be found, then seek an pure and trustworthy male physician or gather a woman who is skilled in this matter or one who points to a woman capable in this art.
Open it (the woman) and order her to examine all that you have ordered her to examine on the stone first, and this is for her to look if the woman is pregnant. If she finds it (the stone), she should press it under her finger.
When (the woman) has done that, order her to squeeze it (the stone), if she is not pregnant and is thin. The one who is able should insert her finger into the vagina and examine the stone after placing her left hand on the belly and press it strongly.
If she finds it (the stone), it is necessary to bring it out of the vagina to its full length until it reaches the end of the canal, then squeeze it at the lower part of the uterus from any side that it comes to her and feel the stone in that position.
And hold the finger (stone) so that it does not lose contact with the pressed stone, and let the squeeze be small initially, then insert a small rod into this small squeeze. If she feels the stone, increase the squeeze to the extent that she knows that the stone is coming out, and know that there are many types of stones (stones).
From it are small and large, malformed and misshapen ones, long and twisted, with a body that is swollen. Know their types in order to use this knowledge as you wish, for if blood overpowers you, then apply powdered agaric [herb] at the site and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out, work with the tools you mentioned for stone removal for men to assist in your work. If blood overpowers you and you are aware that bleeding is one of its symptoms, then place the peony [herb] on the site.
Tie it firmly with strong thread and leave it, do not disturb it. Leave the stone alone and do not remove it; perhaps you will be saved. Treat the wound if bleeding persists for days, and when the area has healed, return to your work until the stone comes out.
The Second Chapter: Sixth.
In the opening of an artery in water.
The water artery is a collection of moisture under the white scrotum that surrounds the testicle, which is called the scrotal sac and may be found in a special pouch nature has prepared for it on one side of the testicle.
Until it appears to be another egg and is located between the scrotal skin and the white scrotum that we mentioned, this should not happen except in the testicle, and this abscess develops from a weakness that exposes it to women, so this substance is applied to it and it can be exposed to striking women.
This pus will be of various colors, either yellowish, or bloody red, or dark brown, or watery white and it is usually white, and the signs that can be recognized by it.
When water accumulates, if it is in the white scrotum that we mentioned, then the worm will be elongated like an egg and the scrotum will not show because the pus surrounds it from all sides.
If the pus is in a hairy scrotum, then the worm will be elongated on one side of the egg.
People may think it is another egg if the pus is between the scrotal skin and the white scrotum, and in this case, it occurs under the testicle. As for if you want to know the color of the pus, press the worm with a hot iron, as its image will appear, anything that comes out after the hot iron has been applied is judged by what is inside it.
If surgery with iron is to be performed, the patient should be commanded to defecate if possible, and you should observe his body appearing relaxed. Then he lies on his back on something slightly raised, and many incisions are made underneath him. You then sit on his left side.
Command the attendant to sit on the right side of the patient, moving him slightly to his left flank and towards the lower part of the abdomen. Then take a long, narrow knife and make an incision in the middle of the scar extending towards the navel.
The incision should be made straight and parallel to the line dividing the scar in half until it reaches the white fat layer. Then cut through and save the fat from being cut, making your cut deeper where it adheres more closely to the white membrane, and make the cut as deep as possible.
Then fill the cavity with water and make sure all the water is removed. Then separate the edges of the incision with retractors, and raise the knife above it without touching the surrounding scar tissue. Cut through as much as you can, either in one piece or in several pieces.
If you do not completely cut the piece, water will not return. If the pus comes out of its skin during your procedure, stop cutting and collect it in a cloth, then sew the wound together.
Then treat the wound with other surgeries until it heals. If the pus is contaminated from another disease, it is necessary to tie the vessels that fear bleeding, then cut the ulcer from the ligament and extract the pus, then treat it as we mentioned before.
If the water is collected in both sides, know that it is a double abscess. Break open the other side where you did the initial procedure, whether it was on one side or not. Do the work, then smear blood (on it).
Enter the abscesses with cords dipped in oil or fat and bring out another cord dipped in liquor and vinegar, spread it on both ulcers and the belly, then place a plug made of cotton from above and they are the drains. Tie them from above with the cord that has six sides on this shape:.
Then, take two drains, tie them and suture with loose sutures on this example. Make the edges from linen or wet wool, gather them together in a band of the serrated vessel, and one of the edges is taken onto the mattress towards the back.
And the second one, take it towards the navel and tie both edges on the lower vessels, then gather all the edges in a band of the serrated vessel. This patch can also be made with iron instead of linen or wool.
Take a small, sharp scalpel blade to cut the fat of the ulcer and it serves as a receptacle for what we have described until the white scab revealing water is exposed. Then take another vessel on this drawing:.
It resembles a Greek eye, then bind it with that scab and serve as a receptacle for what we have described until all the moisture is released. Then move the scab by tweezers and cut the layer containing it into pieces as much as possible until you reach all of it and preserve the egg white so it does not touch fire.
Know that this procedure is safe, far from cutting and better than using a lancet. If you resist in the area of cutting or at the time of the cut and there is hot water, blood or something else, it is necessary to treat each occurrence with the treatment suitable for it according to what you present.
If the cause is a testicle and he does not endure this work due to his skill, do not use the cautery on what I describe and it is if it is healthy according to your evidence from the signs we have provided.
The bladder stone should be treated by having the patient sit on a raised chair, then the worm (instrument) is inserted below it with a wide probe and the cautery is placed along the length of the body, making an opening wide enough for all water to flow out. Then put a cloth over the location and bind it.
Leave him to urinate then treat him until the wound heals, for if water does not come out during your cautery and it is only because the white gauze irritates in the wound of the bladder, preventing the water from coming out.
Then, when this happens, it is necessary to enter the wound with a reed or the instrument that draws out the urine from the bladder, which we have shown its image or add slightly more in opening the wound.
Know that the water may return and gather after six months or around it, if it gathers, cauterize it with the same method and the patient should abstain from sexual activity for a while.
Chapter Three and Forty-Six.
In the Incision on Tendon, and its Treatment.
Know that the incision on this tendon is dangerous and leads to death in most cases, therefore we leave it and ensure safety from it. I record the work done in it and its types of inflammation.
I say that various inflammations occur in the bodies where the testicles are formed, and this is due to many reasons either from excessive heat which settles in the testicles or from a blow. The color of the inflammation is the same as the body's color and there is no fluid present with it.
The inflammation is soft and sometimes the inflammation may be hard in color similar to mud without sensation, and it could be due to suppuration of ulcers or swelling of the veins, so if it is not due to suppuration of ulcers, it is known as feverish inflammation.
If you squeeze it with your fingers and it should not be exposed to fire, as for the one who is due to swelling of the veins, nothing will feverish from squeezing with the fingers. This type may also be incised and cut in other meats.
It means: "It is to incise the skin of the mole, then insert the beech-nut (or ivory nut) into it and extract it from the white scalpel, remove the sutures from the wound, tie the vessels, and cut the mole after removing it from all sides of the beech-nut, if the beech-nut has hardened due to the surrounding meat.
"It is necessary to remove and cut the beech-nut, and if there is any adhesion between the scalpels or vessels, it is necessary to remove all of that adhesion and cut it completely.
"If the flesh grows in the place of adhesion which is behind, it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the beech-nut as we have said. If your work causes a wound, use cotton soaked in oil or liquid to dress it, then treat it with all possible remedies until it heals.
"Chapter Four and Six" (Assuming the excerpt refers to chapter numbers)
"In the treatment of fistula, which is a chronic ulcer.
"Fistula is a chronic ulcer resembling boils, which are caused by an obstruction of the glands, making movement, exercise, and walking difficult. In the treatment of this condition, it is important to avoid pressure near the affected area as much as possible.
It is necessary to mention the work in it regarding what the early practitioners did, so I say that it is necessary for the patient to sit on a high chair, then push the testicles downwards, and grasp the scrotal skin with your fingers along with the forceps which are near the cord.
The assistant should grasp it (the cord) and pull it out forcefully, then you break it with a sharp, narrow clamp made of forceps around the cord until the cord is exposed, then from each side, as I have told you in the description of hernias located in the inguinal region, you cut it off. After that, you tie a thread around it.
You tie it in the first place where there is an opening, and you also tie it at the end, then you break it in the middle, standing upright according to the length of the body, and what accumulated in it of putrid fluids comes out.
Then the bladder is treated with the treatments for other surgeries that are intended to last long enough for the testicles to descend, if an opening has been made for all the testicles, it is necessary for one of the testicles along with the testicle to be removed so as not to prevent the formation of sperm. Before cutting the veins, they swell up and are of no use.
The fifth and sixth chapter.
On the treatment of inflammation caused by worms.
This inflammation occurs due to a fissure that exposes the intestine in the area near the navel, causing the worms to move from the fissure into one of the anuses.
This fissure may be due to a cut in the intestine or an extension of it, and this can occur for various reasons such as a blow, stabbing, scalding, or lifting something heavy, and so on. Its signs are that if it is due to an extension of the intestine, it occurs little by little over a long period of time.
It does not happen with ulcers, and the worms are flat in depth before the intestine is constricted, and its sign is if it is due to a cut in the intestine that it occurs suddenly and causes great pain, and the worms appear differently under the skin close by.
This is the exit of the intestinal contents and its passage outside the intestine, and sometimes the feces may come out with it, so this inflammation is called wormy and fecal, and it may be accompanied by gas, and there may be a blockage in that area where the cause of the problem lies.
Since it causes a difficult and crushing wound, and there is no doubt that it occurs when it gets dark, the treatment of these kinds of injuries with iron is dangerous. Therefore, one must be cautious about it. The method of operation is to order the patient to return the vomit with his hand into his own belly if he comes for returning.
Then, he places himself on his back between your hands and raises his leg. After that, you must peel the skin that is above the wound to its full length, then pierce all of the rotten skin with scalpels according to the size required to open the wound with them.
The wound should be as big as it can accommodate the egg, then you must sharpen the scalpels underneath the rotten skin until a white hard bone is exposed from all sides at which point you may insert your thumb into where the egg is.
Between the white hard bone under the egg shell and the second scalpel, you must apply pressure with it on the ligament behind the egg. Then, use your left hand to pinch into the rotten skin while at the same time moving the white hard bone upwards with your right hand and lifting the egg along with the scalpel towards the wound.
The servant is commanded to place the egg white on top and you tie it. After its release, check with your finger that there is no foreign substance in the hard white egg. If you find something, push it into the abdomen below.
Then take a thin, strong thread of around ten strands and insert it at the end of the bladder that is under the scrotum, then cut the sides of the thread so it becomes four strands. Then gather some of them together in a bundle and tie the bladder that we mentioned is under the scrotum with it using strong knots on both sides, then cut the ends of the strands and tie them strongly so nothing from the urinary tracts can reach it. Make sure that none of this causes a hot abscess and another knot is made outside the first one, more distant from it by less than two fingers' width, then after these two knots, you release the bladder that is under the scrotum as much as the thickness of a finger bone.
Make sure that none of this causes a hot abscess and another knot is made outside the first one, more distant from it by less than two fingers' width, then after these two knots, you release the bladder that is under the scrotum as much as the thickness of a finger bone. Cut the rest of it around and remove the yolk, then cut below the scrotum a deep incision that lets out blood and pus as we previously described, then use thread soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and tie the knots that we mentioned.
If a white falcon, as we mentioned after cutting it, is prone to bleeding excessively, this happens frequently, leave the ligature until it falls by itself. If it does not fall properly, squeeze it with hot water and hold on to what causes it to fall until it does.
Then treat the wound with all means of treating wounds until it heals.
Sixth and seventh chapter.
In the case of a perforated anus, do not attempt to treat it with iron as no one has ever cured it in this way. As previously mentioned, the affected area should be ligated below after cutting it.
Then make an incision in the middle and treat the abscess by whatever opens it until the affected area falls off, and treat the wound as previously described until it heals.
Seventh and eighth chapter.
In the case of a fissure in the armpit.
A fissure in the armpit may occur as mentioned earlier. The location should be identified, but nothing from the female genital area should touch it, and if it does so, it is easier to heal and will always return.
However, if the fissure in the falcon (bird) lasts for a long time, the fart and urine will increase, causing it to spread throughout the fissure, which may extend from the armpit as mentioned earlier. And this is when the lance extends, then it breaks and enters the place, and treatment is with cautery as previously described.
And it can be treated with iron on this surface, which is to press the lesion on its back between your hands, then you should cut the place of the wound with a scalpel in a straight line up to three fingers' width, then you should turn the lancets that are under the skin.
Until the white lancet that follows it is found, you should take a silk thread and place it on the fresh wound of the lancet and press it to its depth, then you should sew the two new edges together on one side of the lancet with the silk thread and join them.
Then you should smooth the edge of the lancet and not cut the ligature or touch the pus or anything else as previously described in the treatment of abscesses, then treat it with surgical treatment.
If the threads break, clean them and tighten the wound until it shrinks, for then the lancet will contract and not cause more bleeding.
Cautery is better in this situation, as it is closer to safety.
The eighth and ninth chapters.
In incision of scrofula (scirrhus) skin.
In excessive scrofula (scirrhus) skin incision, many people may have it without the meat inside swelling and disfiguring its appearance. Therefore, whoever intends to treat it should cauterize the base on its surface.
All the skin that is incised should be cut off from the tough skin, then the two edges are sewn together. If you prefer, first sew the skin that was incised with three or four stitches and pierce through the stitching, then cut what remains between the stitches.
Then treat it with remedies for other surgeries until it heals and the stitches fall off.
The ninth and tenth sections.
In lancing (lancing abscesses).
Lancing (lancing abscesses) is forbidden in our religion.
Since lancing (lancing abscesses) is forbidden in our religion, I did not mention it in my book except for two reasons: one is that this should be known to the physician if he is asked about it and learn its remedy when faced with it, and the other is that we often need to lance some animals for our benefit.
Like camels, dogs, cats and their likes among animals, I say that lancing is done by striking twice: either with a blow of the rod or with a cut and incision. The first one is by placing the animal in hot water until it swells, followed by milking and scraping.
Then hold it with your hand until it softens and does not show sign of resistance upon touch, as for lancing and cutting, it is necessary to grasp the animal and pull its skin aside with your left hand, then bind and cut open on each egg individually.
Hold them until the eggs appear, then cut them without leaving any of the eggshells other than the thin one that is on the shells. This strike for lancing is better than that which is with the hammer.
As the hammer may leave some of the ants remaining, the animal gets frightened, so treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter seventy.
Treating scrofula.
Scrofula appears in males, either it shows above the skin or in the skin between the testicles shaped like a woman's breast and there is hair on it, and it may cause urinary discharge from the one who has it in the skin of the scrotum.
And in women, there is one type that appears above the breast like small breast buds coming out to the outside, resembling a man's testicles and having two similar to female nipples, treatment for the three types.
Two types of men and one type of women should have the excess flesh cut off until its effects are alleviated, then it should be treated like other surgeries until healed. As for the second type of man who excretes urine from the scrotum, there is no treatment or cure for it.
The First and Seventy-First Section.
On the incision of cysts and excessive flesh from female genitals.
The cyst may increase in size beyond its natural state until it becomes hard and unsightly, and in some women it can grow so large that it resembles a man's organ and may gather together.
It is necessary to grasp the cyst with your hand or a pincer and cut it off, avoiding cutting too deep and never reaching the root to prevent bleeding.
Then it should be treated like other surgeries until healed. As for the cystic flesh, it is a growth that fills the uterus until it is full.
It may also protrude outside like a tumor. Therefore, it is sometimes called a "tumorous disease," and it should be cut off like a cyst and treated until healed.
Chapter Two, Section Seventy-Two.
Treatment of Wounds.
Wounds are either the vaginal opening of a woman that is not perforated, or a perforation that is small and may be either natural, born with it, or artificial, caused by an illness that has advanced, or from excessive meat (flesh) growth.
A wound may be shallow, thick or deep; it may be in the womb (uterus), its sides, above or below it; and it prevents intercourse, bondage, childbirth and possibly miscarriage. Recognizing this is through observation of symptoms.
If the wound is visible, and it is not visible then one should examine it with fingers or a probe. If the wound is shallow and close to the vaginal opening then it should be cut near the edges, then put on forceps from both hands.
The woman, upon her back, has a boil on her; then the lancets are applied with force until the thin skin is broken and the abscess opens. Then take wool, soak it in oil, place it at the site, and have the woman gather [the pus] every day to prevent the site from being infected again.
If the abscess is thick and swollen, it should be pierced with a broad lancet resembling parchment. If the abscess is of meat, tie it with thread and cut it, and keep with you medicines to stop the flow of pus such as qaqiya, shiyan and laban mixed together with white chalk.
Then use a copper cannula that is wide so as not to quickly infect the wound, tie it for days and apply camphor oil from dry wood then treat with other treatments until it heals. It may contain meat of another plant, in this case, it is necessary to cut it in this way.
If it was not a cancerous tumor, a malignant tumor that is in the breast would not be exposed to iron (for cauterization).
Chapter Thirty and Seven.
In the treatment of abscesses, fistulas and colored boils that occur in women's private parts.
In the case of an abscess, it is a swelling of the orifices until blood flows continuously from it. If the abscess persists, it becomes a fistula. I have mentioned its types, signs, and here they are explained further.
That which is not treatable and that which is treatable, I say that abscesses and fistulas in the uterus when they are not palpable are not treated with iron. If there is a palpable one in the vagina, it is to be treated.
It is necessary for the woman to enter a cold place, then the fistula is squeezed with forceps or a thick pliers and cut from its roots, and left on until blood stops flowing from one of the cutting instruments that stop bleeding without pain.
Similar to sores, wounds and leprosy, then her legs are raised to the wall for an hour, then she is made to stand in cold water if bleeding continues. If it persists, she should sit in a hot sauna and on hot stones and sand, then take fine flour made from barley mixed with honey and butter.
Apply pressure to the wound, if bleeding stops there is no need for anything more, otherwise press the iron splint and the forceps without any condition, then take a bandage and immerse it in the tarathith juice or milk of the camel's colostrum or goat's colostrum with wine, and place it on the spot.
If the tumor subsides, treat the spot with almurham until it bursts. As for the red lump, it resembles the heads of the scorpions rough to look at, so what appears of it on the surface should be cut off as described in Althailil, and treat it until it bursts.
The fourth and seventy-seventh chapter.
In the incision that is made in the abdomen.
In the abdomen, various types of tumors may appear such as cancer, hardened worms, boils, ulcers, carbuncles, fistulas, fissures, thailil, hot worms, and all these diseases and their characteristics and signs have been mentioned in the classification.
It is necessary to mention in this article the hot worm that appears in the abdomen if it is one of the tumors that accumulate for a long time, how should its incision be made with iron, it is necessary to look at it and if the worm's pain is at the beginning hard with blows and inflammation and swelling.
If it appears red, if a burn occurs on him, do not rush to lance it immediately and treat it with whatever soothes the blister until these symptoms subside. At that point, it is appropriate for the woman to sit on a chair with two seats and lean on her back.
She should gather her legs together towards the lower abdomen and be barefooted, with her arms under her knees and bind them with a strap that is suitable.
Then, the woman who is in need should sit on the right side and use the instrument that opens the uterus's cavity, which you will find its image afterwards. It is important to note that if you wish to use this instrument, you should have an idea of the depth of the woman's womb so that what enters from the tool does not exceed the depth of her womb.
If the instrument is too deep, it is important to place a reed on the back of the uterus's neck to prevent the entire tool from entering the depth of the womb and make sure that the lobe in the tool comes out from the upper side.
You hold the instrument and the assistant holds the lobe until it reaches the back of the uterus, when the pouch appears and is touched with the hand and seems soft, it is appropriate to squeeze its tip with a flat instrument until it empties completely.
It is required that in an incision, there should be a linear smooth (incision) made in the fat of the abdomen or green oil containing some tension. The linear smooth (incision) should be outside the cavity on the back of the peritoneum and it should appear on the abdominal wall and on the flank as clean wool soaked in water that has been washed by tailors.
Then treat with a poultice for a few days using the suitable kind of plaster until it heals.
Wash the abdomen and incision with water and vinegar, then with water that has been boiled and in which the root of the fennel or long zedoary has been soaked. Then return to the poultice; if there is any pus inside the abdomen, it should be removed.
It is required to abstain from treating with iron; instead, treat as mentioned in the previous section.
Chapter Fifty and Seven.
On the teaching of bandages, how to treat living worms that have come out in an irregular shape.
It is essential for bandagers to first know the natural shape of a birth; one of its signs is if you see the woman go down and contract, and she feels the need to exhale and something is felt on her that is not there normally.
The speed of delivery indicates that this birth will be natural in shape, and the baby will emerge from the head or still attached to or suspended from the placenta. If you observe these signs, it is necessary to apply pressure on the abdomen to expel the baby quickly.
If it descends onto the head, the afterbirth is expelled along with it and the membranes are cleansed properly, then this birth is natural and not abnormal, because the baby might be born with its legs first and its hands before its head.
One hand or one foot is born, or its head and hand are born, or it comes out sideways and bends towards its heels, etc., among the abnormal shapes. Therefore, those who can should be gentle with all these things and avoid haste and mistakes.
I clearly describe each shape and how to deal with it for reference, if the baby is born on its head in a normal delivery and the woman experiences pain or the expulsion is difficult for her and you notice her strength weakening, then sit her on a chair and tell women to hold her.
And the uterus is softened with cooked honey and wet poultices, then the patient is introduced small fingers to open the membrane or break it with a finger until the moisture within it is drained and the woman's abdomen ripens until the fetus descends.
If the fetus does not descend, it is necessary to inflate the woman with air along with syrup of walnut and then command her after inflation to expel it with force using a bladder and seizing its neck and opening, for the fetus will come out within an hour. If the hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary to press them slightly.
If the membrane does not break, place the woman on a bench and raise her legs above it, then shake the bench on the ground and the woman should hold herself to prevent falling off. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and draw out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie the hands with a cord and draw them up, for the fetus will come out. The exit of the fetus on the legs indicates that it should be pushed upward slightly, then adjusted to fit, and one of the legs is taken and pulled slightly.
If it (the fetus) comes out of the two cavities (of the uterus), order it to be cleansed and anointed with oil, for it will come out then. If it does not come out as we have described, or it only comes out little by little until it assumes its natural shape, it will come out gradually when it does. Prevent all that has been described.
From the wounds of the thighs and the navel, apply oil and perfume dissolved in it, then strike all around in the womb strongly, then let her rest and lower her body, then sit her in water until she reaches labor pains.
If you find that she has given birth, make an incision for her from the vulva and take hold of it. If you hold the incision for an hour, sit her on a chair, then anoint and close her wounds, pinch her nose and mouth, press gently but firmly below her navel. The fetus will come out within an hour; the fetus comes out on its back and hands.
If it comes out with this appearance, insert your fingers slightly into it and the woman will pull its legs downwards. She will lie on her back and stretch out her body while lying on a bed, then hold its feet and press gently but firmly above its abdomen. Then, bring out whatever is beneath her feet, move them to the lower position if the child does not come out. If it does not issue forth, pull both legs together forcefully, then press slightly above the vagina, just enough for the child to ascend, and then enter with your hand and gently extract the child.
The woman should be made to bear down until the child comes out, the child's birth is difficult and resisting by one hand. If she cannot push, the woman should lie down, but if she cannot lie down, she should sit up.
Lay her down, shake her body and legs forcefully, then apply the leech mentioned in the remedies. If it grasps her, sit her on a chair and treat her in the position of lying down. Adjust the child's position naturally and straighten her out. Make her bear down until the child comes out.
The child should be born on its feet with its face towards the mother's chest. It is important to grasp the child's hand and gently turn it and adjust its position accordingly. If it is level, place what we have described as oil and remedies on its head.
Then move it slightly, then if you do that, place it on the cradle and command her to turn towards the right side, then make her strain and press it with your fingers. For it will come out, the birth of the child lies on the side.
If the fetus descends into the birth canal in this position with the head towards the back, break the waters by pressing with your fingers until it discharges from its wetness. Once it is attached to the child's face and neck, cut it from behind so that it does not tighten and die. Then push the child inside until it is in the correct position.
Command the woman to strain repeatedly, for it will come out easily, the birth of twins or multiple children often occur, be aware that twins often give birth and can have three or four live babies, except in rare cases, but five is beyond nature and they do not usually survive after birth.
Wrap them with a band and if they are multiple fetuses, let them separate by using a pair of forceps attached to each one in secret. Each fetus will come out naturally as easily as a single child does, but they will come out in a problematic manner as we have described.
If one of them becomes constricted at birth and changes into what we have described as unnatural shapes, treat it as previously described, to make it pliable and perform the operation with skill, force, and adaptability in every shape that requires such maneuvering for safety.
Describes what is formed in the womb as grapes, some may fall out. One or two or three or four or five or six or seven or more than ten may form and it has happened to me that a woman has given birth to seven and another to fifteen, all of them being formed.
By estimation of the Wise and Knowledgeable, all this should be part of the knowledge of what can happen to her in case such a thing occurs unexpectedly.
Chapter Six and Seventy.
On extracting the stillborn infant.
If the stillborn infant is treated as described in the classification of treatment but does not come out and the situation forces you to act with your hands, it is necessary that the woman be examined. If she is strong and there is nothing of the symptoms which might cause harm to her from it, it is necessary for the woman to lie on her back.
The head should be somewhat low and the neck raised in two places, and a servant holds it from both sides or it may be tied to the bed so that the body does not move during labor.
Then, the opening of the uterus is moistened with damp sponges along with the knuckle and the olive oil, then she is anointed on her hand with these sponges and instruments. Then she enters into the uterus with them, requesting a location to bind the fetus's cords from the childbirth. The suitable positions for this are...
If the child is bottom-first, the cords are tied around its neck in one of the following locations: in the eyes, on the temples, in the mouth, under the chin, near the anus or beneath the navel.
If the child is foot-first, it should be in the anus and middle area (perineum). The cord should be held with the right hand and pinched between the fingers of the left hand, and then entered with the hand to tie the cord in one of the mentioned locations.
Keep pulling until something comes out, then tie another or third cord if necessary to ensure the pull is even and not directed towards one side. Then move the pull steady and smoothly without causing the cord to twist or become uneven.
It is not easy to extract [the fetus] as when making an incision in the gums during a tooth extraction. However, it is necessary between this to pack the cavity with cotton, if a side of it is clamped, it is necessary to anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from that side to manipulate what was clamped; if some of the fetus comes out, move the forceps to other locations.
It raises little to do this until the entire fetus comes out, but if a hand emerges before another and cannot be pulled back due to being clamped, it is necessary to break its bones, then pull it until all of it has been cut off.
It should be done either in the wrist or the neck, and it is necessary to do this with the other hand and the forceps; if the head of the fetus is large and there is pressure during its extraction or if water accumulates in its head, it is necessary to insert a pointed instrument between the fingers.
She should crush the head with it to make the water come out or pierce it with the device called the forceps, which is depicted in pictures along with other devices in the following chapter.
Likewise, if the fetus has a large head, it is necessary to crush the skull or pierce it with the forceps as previously mentioned, then extract the bones with forceps; when the head comes out and is squeezed during extraction, it is necessary to squeeze until the fluid contained in the chest is released.
If the chest does not join, and it does not come out on its own, cut as much as you can. If it is below the abdomen or there is a hernia or pus in it, it should be packed to remove moisture from it.
If the fetus is on the mother's thigh, its drawing is easy and you shall place it in the woman's mouth so that she may swallow it. If it presses against the abdomen or the chest, you should draw it out with a hook which you have heated with fire and sharpened with a file, and break open the abdomen or the chest until whatever is within is removed.
If you remove all the parts and return the head, grasp it with your left hand, if the mouth of the womb is open, enter your hand into the neck of the womb, seize the head with your fingers, and draw it back to the mouth of the womb, then insert a pair of forceps or a single one, and draw out the head with them.
If the mouth of the womb has joined with a hot narrow passage, it should not be pressed but instead a poultice of moist materials should be applied and fumigation used, and sit in warm water to soften.
If the embryo is on one side, it can be corrected. However, do not use what we described for a living embryo, unless it cannot be corrected. In that case, cut and extract it. It is best not to leave anything of the afterbirth inside the uterus. If your treatment is complete, apply what we described for treating hot abscesses which occur in the womb.
If there is a discharge of blood, let it drain in absorbent waters and apply all the treatment. A woman was observed who had given birth to an embryo that died within her, then she gave birth again.
Then the second embryo also died, and she had a prolonged discharge afterwards and a swelling in her examination, which inflated until it opened and allowed pus to flow out. She was referred for treatment, and was treated for a long time but the wound did not heal. She was then dressed with some strong absorbent poultices.
A bone came out from the location, then she stayed for days until another bone came out. She was surprised because her abdomen did not contain a bone, so she thought it might be from the dead embryo's bones. She examined the wound and extracted many bones from the head of the embryo.
I did not stop until I extracted numerous bones from her, and the woman was in the best of health conditions. She lived for a long time, which passed easily, and indeed, this rare occurrence has come here.
In her, there is knowledge and assistance for what the physician who seeks to heal with his hands tries to achieve.
Chapter Seven and Seventy.
There are images of the tools necessary for the extraction of the fetus.
Image of a probe to open the womb.
The implement called a probe, which is found in books whether it has probes on both sides of wood pieces or not, this probe should ideally be softer than the implement and may be made from ivory or boxwood and each piece should fit snugly into two fingers.
Their shapes are similar to fingers and their length is about a palm or slightly less, and in the middle of the wood pieces there are two needles of the same type that have been inserted into them, each needle is about half a palm or slightly more, and their width is like two fingers or slightly more.
These are the two that enter into the womb of the nose to open the eustachian tubes with them, an image of another device similar to this is shown, softer and smaller:.
Make from the wood of ivory or bone in the shape of a syringe, except that there are rods on its side as you see, the length of each rod being similar to a finger and their width being about two fingers, so when you wish to open the womb with it.
Place the woman on a chair with her legs spread apart, then insert these two rods, plugged (or closed), into the womb of the nose and hold the bottom part of the device between her feet, then open the device with your hand as you would a syringe, to whatever extent you wish to open the womb. Until you make what you wish, an image of another eustachian tube is mentioned by the ancients:.
Image of the instrument used to expel the fetus:.
Image of the forceps used to extract the head of the fetus:.
It resembles a knife in having teeth on its side as you see, and it can be made straight like a syringe in this image, as it has teeth like those of a saw that cuts and severs:.
Image of a probe also:
Image of a ligature:.
This ligature has a small amount of wire in it to prevent it from breaking during the drawing of the fetus with it, image of double-edged ligature:.
Image of wide forceps for cutting the fetus:.
All these tools, as their types increased and were made ready by the manufacturer to be quicker in their use and raise among people for their ability, it is not right for any tool to remain with you unassembled for there will surely be a need for it:.
The eighth and seventieth section:.
On the extraction of stones (or calculi):.
If the calculus is retained after breathing, it is necessary to order the patient to grab himself, then press his abdomen with your hands and forcefully push it out. If it does not come out this way, take a clyster:.
Make a hole in the container, place in it the opened medicinal herbs such as fodena, sadaba, shabta, bapuna, silecha, qanturiun and salikha or any of them. Soak them in water and heat them on fire. Then put a copper tube on the hole of the container and the other end into the womb:.
Hold it until the hot iron reaches the bladder cavity, then it should be punctured as we have mentioned before; if the pus does not come out after this treatment, the able ones are ordered to press their left hand in Shiraj oil or ball-playing liniment.
Then introduce it into the cavity and feel for the pus; if it touches it, grasp it and pull it gently until it comes out. If it is adhered in the depth of the bladder, put your hand on what we have described until you find the pus; then attract it gently.
In order to avoid the bladder from falling during a strong pull, it is recommended that it be moved toward the sides, left and right, then gradually increase the pulling force; when it responds, it will come out and free itself from adherence. If there is pus in the bladder, we have described its treatment as puncturing and application of cupping glasses and alum.
If nothing comes out after all the treatments we have described, strike it with your fist again in order to increase the pulling force; however, it is recommended that the material expelled from it be tied to the bladder opening by a woman's hand and then apply warm leeches to it. This will soften it after several days.
It should be drained and removed, except if it has decomposed; for then, it exudes a foul smell towards the body and the head, and this harms the patient. Therefore, suitable smoke must be used.
The woman has been tried with some substances like burned frankincense and myrrh, the image of the instrument which burns a woman when touched by leprosy and such like:.
It is made of lead resembling cloth, or of copper with the narrow edge put in the fire and the wide edge on the ember, while the incense is placed on the lesion, until the incense goes away and something else takes its place.
The ninth chapter and seventy.
Treatment for non-penetrating piles.
Many children may have non-penetrating piles, and if they cannot be pierced with a sharp probe, it should be touched with a blunt instrument and caution must be taken not to press the surrounding tissue.
Then, a swab soaked in liquid and oil is placed on it, and it is treated with a plaster until it dries, if one fears that it may suppurate, a lead pipe is put into the wound for several days until the child wants to pass stool.
The prolapse of the anus can also be caused by injury or ulceration. It is necessary to alleviate this condition first, then treat it as previously mentioned in our treatment and resuscitation. (Literally: And the prolapse of the saddle (i.e., anus) may also occur due to injury or ulceration. It is obligatory to remove this condition, then to treat it with what we have mentioned concerning treatment and resuscitation.)
The eighteenth section. (Literally: The eighteenth part.)
On the treatment of anal fistulas that occur below. (Literally: In the treatment of the fistulae that happen below.)
Anal fistulas that occur below are caused by abscesses close to the anus, from outside or inside one of its sides. The fistula(s) may be single or multiple. (Literally: The fistulae that happen below are due to an abscess occurring near the anus from outside or within one of its sides, and the fistula(s) may be single or more than one.)
If the abscess is unopened, it will produce a pus of white or yellow color, and may be one of these fistulas that open towards the skin or to the anus, and not open at all. The opened ones can be recognized by what comes out from them, such as pus and gas when probed. (Literally: If this abscess is not opened, it will produce a watery pus of white or yellow color, and may be one of these fistulas that opens towards the skin or to the anus, and not open at all. The opened ones can be recognized by what comes out from them, such as pus and gas when probed.)
And possibly, what comes out from it is blood, and it may be a fistula if it is located in the space that opens towards the bladder or to the urethra, or it may open into the scrotum or perianal area, which are known as opened fistulas. The fistulas that open into the anus are also included in this category without being mentioned separately. (Literally: And possibly, what comes out from it is blood, and it may be a fistula if it is located in the space that opens towards the bladder or to the urethra, or it may open into the scrotum or perianal area, which are known as opened fistulas. The fistulas that open into the anus are also included in this category without being mentioned separately.)
Insert your little finger into the anus and insert a fine probe made of copper or iron if it is not in the rectum. If there is already a probe inside, insert a fine probe made of lead or hair from horse's mane.
Feel the probe or the hair until your little finger, if you don't feel it and nothing comes out from the hole nor gas nor smell as we have said, then know that it is not penetrated. In this case, proceed to treatment.
If the rectum is perforated into the bladder or the urethra, a sign of this is the passage of urine from it and its inability to be treated with medication. As for if it is perforated into the division of the intestines or the anus, a sign of this is the arrival of the probe at that location.
If there is no perforation towards the bone and pain in that area, with continuous passage of pus from it, and if it cannot be treated or medication does not alleviate it, then these perforations should not be caused by probing.
The treatment is in vain for those who probe it due to medical ignorance, and as for those that are not perforated or obstructed, they should be probed with iron as I have described and as I have tried, which is to press the affected area between your fingers on its surface.
He should insert his finger into the nostril, then introduce a copper or lead cannula if there is an obstruction in the nose, until he learns where it ends. If it feels like a seat (impediment), he must insert his little finger as a probe at the impediment.
If he feels the cannula in his little finger has passed through without feeling any resistance between his finger and it by touch or flesh, then know confidently that it has been inserted correctly and do not tire further as there is no pain as we said.
They say that in some people it causes pain during sleep, and the remedy which is beneficial is to cover a thin cup over the nostril as it fits and a caretaker puts it in the nose until it reaches the seat, then returns it twice or thrice.
Until you know that all the excessive and swollen tissues resembling chicken coop's straw have been burnt, then treat it with a paste made of olive oil and honey until the burnt tissue comes out, then treat it with salves containing salt to heal.
Unless it (the suture) is pulled out, it will never be relieved from treatment forever. If the needle has entered into a finger that is in the sheath and there is thick flesh or cartilage between it and the needle, and you see the nail on the surface of the skin, break the skin at the first sight of the nail. Advance the incision with the needle until it reaches the spot where the tip of the nail ends and the needle is freed and falls off, then clean out the coagulated flesh resembling bird feathers, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with caustic lime until it is relieved, for if bleeding persists and there is a wound between you and your work, cut out the excess flesh. It is better and more advantageous to burn it with fire or a sharp scalpel, because burning with fire gathers two good outcomes: it burns the excessive flesh.
Cut the bleeding and clean the moisture, then treat it with medicated oil or kerosene until the situation settles and the burned flesh is expelled from the wound. Then treat the wound at that time with caustic lime to harden the meat.
The medication that contains a setting and cleans is such that, if it contracts, it has evacuated and will not cause harm; however, if the patient has reached the depth of the incision and is beyond the body surface, you should insert your finger into the incision and explore with it.
If you feel a cord between yourself and him and it has a covering of membrane or flesh and is near the opening, work should not be done except along the route of hope and prayer. This is because one should use one of three methods: either cauterize it as we said before.
Either it is to divide it up until the cavity is reached so that the probe and treatment can be done from close by, but do not cut too much so as not to cut the surrounding muscles; thus, the abscess will discharge on its own, then treat it as we have said before, and probably it will heal as we have described.
Either, it is to perform the operation of peeling off and incising that cord which we have mentioned, either by a probe or another sharp tool. Then clean all the affected flesh in the abscess until you can reach the incision site as described before.
Then the surgeon shall remove all the nasal bones with the fracture and the upper jaw, until it is closed. The patient's nose remains open within the splint, making it most apparent to the observer. The nose may be crushed on this characteristic.
If a splint is inserted into the nose and it is on one side of the splint close to the body with skin and the edge of the splint, take a splinter at that time with a hollow tip like a probe on this picture:.
Insert five or similar number of threads into it, then insert the splint with the thread in the nose until it reaches its cavity. If it is open in the splint's hole from inside closely,..
Then remove the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the splint and pulling out one end of the thread, gather both ends together, tighten them and leave it for a day or two. Whenever the thread cuts through the flesh, it will tighten strongly until that meat between the threads is cut off and falls away, then treat the wound until it heals and closes.
If the upper jaw is not open, pierce it as much as you can without injuring the nerve, then treat it as described earlier until it heals and closes.

The first and twenty-eighth section.
On bleeding vessels that exude blood and their cutting and treatment of wounds.
Blood vessels are on the veins, either inside a joint that resemble red blisters or like grapes and they may be small or large and blood is constantly exuding from them.
One may be present or many, and they may be outside a joint except that those outside the joint are usually less moist, constantly exuding clear water or a small amount of blood, and they are on the color of the body.
Treatment of what is within the joint is to order the patient to flex and extend it until the joint pops out and shows you the thigh bones, then speed up and seize it with pliers or hold it with your thumb, then cut it at its roots. If the pliers do not stick due to its moisture and slipperiness.
"Hold it with a thick forceps or a piece of strong thread, or pull it with your fingers, then cut it, after which, apply some pointed cauterizing irons to the place where it was cut in order for it to heal well, or burn it with what comes next under the section of cauterization.
"Treat it with all possible treatments until it heals, if the pus does not come out, draw it with a lancet to let some pus out and clean the abscess, then quickly remove it as soon as the pus starts flowing out, the external pus is easy to treat.
"Take it with your plier or tie it with a bandage and cut it, then treat it as described earlier until it heals, if one dislikes cutting it with iron, use a knife instead, take a thread and insert it into the incision.
"Then, draw the pus to the top and insert a probe into its base from the other side, loosen the thread below the probe, it will be resistant and resist strongly, then tie the thread and remove the probe, do this with all the pus, but leave one untouched.
Extract the good blood from it, then place a leech covered in oil or powder on the seat. Instruct the patient to remain still, then leave it until it falls off. If the leeches fall off, treat it with cauterization and other treatments until it heals.
As for the treatment of ulcers, often there is a lack of nutrition and poor complexion. If it persists without improvement despite medication, it is necessary to cure it by scraping with a scalpel or a knife until it becomes moist and the upper layer that prevents healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as desired, if it does not heal, repeat the treatment with stronger scraping until it bleeds and becomes sores, then treat it. It will heal.
The second chapter is number eight.
On the treatment of twisted warts, non-twisted warts and stiff leeches and ants.
The wart is nothing but a long cord on the skin, resembling a thorn. It appears all over the body and especially at the soles of the feet and fingers. It causes pain when walking.
It is required that whatever surrounds the ligature be cut and held with forceps or a lasso, then pulled from its origin, and it should be treated afterwards. As for the hardened thongs, one of them is the netuo small and hard, smooth on top of the body.
Often, in the hands of children, pustules appear and their treatment is to break them or burn them with a cotton thread or wool until they fall off. If you wish, you can cover it with fire or medicine.
The inverted and non-inverted thongs are pulled out with the machine that I mentioned earlier in the treatment of the scabies, as for the scabies, it is also a small hard netuo on the surface of the body going deep into the flesh. If it is affected by cold, its pain resembles the sting of a flea.
There are many in the body, and most of them are in the hands. Their treatment is to take a pipe from an eel or a strong bird's beak and put that pipe around the scabies until it surrounds the entire scabies. Then, turn your hand on the pipe until what surrounds the scabies is cut.
It should be placed deep in the flesh and the maggots will be driven out from their source, if you wish to do so, you can accomplish this with a copper or iron tube on this image:.
The tops of the tubes should be narrowed and tapered to facilitate grip and handling, if you wish to collect maggots in any of the tubes, place them at the openings of the tubes.
The Third and Twenty-Eighth Section.
In the images of tools used for puncturing in fractures, dislocations and ulcers.
A puncturing tool may be made of copper, brass or zinc and may be molded or beaten. This instrument can also be made in various sizes according to the users needs. The tools used for treating small children will be smaller in size, and those whose fractures are tight or painful will require larger puncturing tools. Here is an image of a large puncturing tool:.
The upper part of the plaster that binds the fracture should be wide, with a groove where the fracture is bound as you can see. The lower part that enters the fracture should be narrowed greatly at the top, with two holes on one side and one hole on the other.
The depth of the wound should be on firm flesh or slightly firm and the dressing made from animal fat or linen should be small, its diameter being a cubit.
Make multiple incisions as one rotates, and ensure that between each incision there is firm flesh of the finger width. Then, insert threads made from a soft fabric like silk into these incisions, about ten or so. Gather them together to form a dressing similar to a small pouch. If medication is to be placed at the top of the needle between two stones, press it firmly and tightly before piercing (the skin). Here is an image of a circular dressing and incision.
To fill the needle or syringe with medicine, ensure it is as full as possible without risking leakage, and be cautious to avoid it becoming too hot or too cold. Then, apply the medication to the affected area and draw it upwards.
Place a cotton ball or gauze under the needle, then rub the shaft of the needle with oil, white of an egg, olive oil, or similar substances. Then, insert it into the vessel and, assisted by the attendant, squeeze it firmly until all contents within the needle are expelled from the instrument.
Then the lancet is drawn out and the opening is washed towards the wall, if a medicine for discharge is applied it should grasp whatever can be and if it sleeps through the night it will achieve its purpose, if a lancet is made in an ulcer of suppuration and hastens its discharge then hold the lancet firmly until it heals.
If there are abscesses or painful boils, the lancet should be very delicate and soft, gentler than those used for cutting children's skin. This is an image of a soft and tightly sealed lancet:
The Fourth and Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Wounds.
I have mentioned in the classification of treatment for things that cause pain, and here I will mention their treatment with hands and medicines to perfection. I say that wounds differ according to what is in the wound and according to the location where the injury occurs.
The things that may cause wounds are numerous, such as a splinter, stone, sword or knife cut, saw or hammer blow, or something similar.
And as for the location of the wounds on the body, they are such as a wound on the head or neck or chest or abdomen or back and similar body parts.
I describe the treatment of certain surgeries to make them a measure and establish rules for other surgeries, and I shall begin with simple head surgeries, as their complexities will be described in the third chapter of this book.
When a simple wound occurs in the head without bone fracture and it is only skin injury, if it is large and there is fear of inflammation or abscess formation, I would cauterize the wound at its base. Do not delay this and drain the blood from it to the extent of its strength, unless there is an obstruction preventing cauterization; also, if the blood flowing out of the wound is easy and the cauterization is opposite the injured side.
The user should be warned against excessive food, alcohol, and heavy meals as they may prevent draining; if such prevention occurs, the person should eat little, avoid meat and alcohol, and carry the wound if it becomes inflamed with a hot pus-filled boil or with pus in alcohol.
If the inflammation subsides, carry on with the wound if it is dry with blood and has not changed due to the bad-smelling air I described for you later; however, if it has changed due to the bad smell, use some antiseptics.
Until the wound heals, then treat it until it scabs over. If the injury is large and was caused by a sword or something similar and the edges of the wound did not meet, sew it up with stitches as I have described in the abdominal surgeon's stitching.
If the skin is torn and exposed bone, and it does not heal by itself except in a loose connection, then cut it off. Then treat the wound with medicines that force it to heal quickly and strengthen the skin. It is also recommended that the patient eat nutritious foods such as heads (of animals) and herbs, etc.
If there is an abscess in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut off all the affected area and cauterize it, but if these cuts produce bleeding that cannot be stopped by medicines, probe the abscesses.
If the abscess does not ripen, open it with a lancet and tie it, but if it becomes necessary to drain it and what we have mentioned did not help, let it continue to ripen until blood is produced. These are simple cuts, so their treatment is easy; all that is required is to apply heat to them and they will heal by themselves with their own blood.
Before it is changed by air, the compound of the urine is taken from milk a part and from sour [substance] a part and from burnt [lime] or unburnt [lime] three parts. All are to be crushed and sieved and strained with it the wound and it is to be tightly bound until it adheres well to it with a good plaster.
It is tied with blood, then it is bound from above with the salves and left until it does not dissolve, whatever remains that does not cause inflammation; for it will not be affected by the medicine until it heals. This can be done with lime alone if milk and sour [substance] are not available.
This action can also be performed in many large surgeries if one is skilled in its placement and binding, and the surgeries were simple without air affecting them; but if air had affected some of it or especially if it was during summer time.
In the placement of this compound, it does not mean to treat it as we have described by applying some pressed bandages or applying an ointment made from barley flour and water and honey until the wound exudes pus, then treating it with other remedies until it heals.
If a fracture occurs along with an injury, and it is easy to move, draw it together with forceps. I have already mentioned the treatment for skull fractures that do not require traction, such as in cervical surgery. If an injury occurs at the neck, there is no difference in the treatment between this and a simple skull fracture.
If a vein or artery has been cut in the neck, the solution is not to attempt treatment with strong pulling devices such as tweezers and pliers, as these can harm the vessel and make healing difficult.
Do not place anything cold, such as a metal probe, on the injury because the vessel is warm and it should be treated with mild medications like diluted vinegar or warm olive oil and aloe vera.
If you wash the wound and all metal objects and wet bandages with cold water, and if the injury is large, use stitching or press the edges together with forceps before treating it until it heals.
If there is a hollow in the wound and pus has accumulated below it, press it down into a lower area, if an artery or vein has been cut in the wound, tie it off or apply pressure if necessary.
If the wound has cut through some of the layers of the skin or all of them and the edges are smooth, gather the skin together with sewing on the tip of the wound and do not press the wound but rather spread it and place it in its natural shape, then tighten it firmly and leave it for a few days.
Then treat it with the cauterizing agents that contain purgative and drying properties until it scabs over. If the wound has affected the bone, probe it, if there are any fragments of bone, pull them all out or as much as possible and leave it to heal by itself and for the wound to scab over and ease its removal.
If the wound is gaping, leave it to heal on its own. If there is a bone injury and it becomes swollen, treat it as described in the chapter about such cases, for example, surgery of the chest and between the arms.
If it is a stab wound or cut with a sword or knife and you see a cavity in it, check if air comes out when it is blown. If the air does not come out and it is gaping with blood, do not put anything into it first and do not cauterize it so that the blood does not clot in its cavity.
Into the heart it is directed, and the culprit is killed, but make two cauteries in it and let it be healed by day twice; if it does not heal, make a small piece of cantharides in the wound to draw out the moisture, and make the culprit sleep on the wound.
To relieve what accumulates in it, even if it has passed for three days or more and nothing happened to the culprit with choking, redness or tightness in the soul, and you find all other conditions healthy, then know that the wound is safe; treat it with a poultice and all other treatment until it heals.
If the wound is constantly weeping and the pus persists, then know that it has turned gangrenous; treat it from its opening, let the culprit relieve what accumulates in it, whether it has passed for the chest or the back; treat it with whatever sewing is appropriate.
Whether it is large or small, if it has caused damage to the bone and broken fragments from it have appeared, then explore the wound and make every effort to remove those fragments if they are free; if they are not free, leave them until.
Incising a wound is easy to extract, and as for other surgeries that occur in various body parts, their treatment is determined by the rules we have mentioned.
The Fifth and Sixty-Fourth Chapter.
In Abdominal Surgery, Evacuation of the Contents and Suturing It.
A rupture that reaches the abdomen may be large or small and central. The larger one can have contents evacuated or multiple contents, and their introduction and suturing will be more difficult.
A small rupture may also be more difficult from another perspective, thus it is necessary to return it, which is more difficult. If the contents do not move in the process of returning them to their place, they will swell and harden, making the return process more difficult. Therefore, a medium-sized rupture is preferable because it does not cause difficulty with the return of the contents as it does in these types.
Know that the abdomen can be sutured in two ways, both general ones suitable for abdominal suturing and other surgeries of the body, and the others are specific to other surgeries but are particularly associated with abdominal suturing.
And I explain to you, one by one, in detail and explanation: If the wound is small and something from the muscle comes out of it and it tightens (contracts), that is either because of the smallness of the tear as we have said before, or because the muscle was exposed to inflation due to the coldness of the air.
If it is as such, it is necessary to heat it by putting a damp cloth or poultice in warm water and applying it directly or if it has been cooked (boiled), let the wound heal and wait for it to drain and swell before applying a plaster and pressing it down until the muscle absorbs the inflammation.
The drink that contains leeches is the best for the dissolution of inflammation, and if you see that the inflammation has dissolved, wash the wound with hot water that has been boiled in it with crushed or powdered herbs; this will ease its penetration.
If it persists after this treatment and the wound fails to heal, make a small incision in the tear with an instrument that makes incisions (scalpel), and if possible, the first treatment is preferable to incision; only resort to incision when necessary and when leeches fail. This is the image of the instrument:.
The pointed end should be limited, while the other end is not. The tip should not be a needle's point but rather a slight indentation, resembling a small scalpel as you see it. If the wound expands and blood vessels enter, it is necessary to return it to its natural shape.
The best position for the instrument is if you can manage it like that, and as for a wound that is wide and in the lower abdomen, it is necessary to press the applicator on its surface and make the one applying it lift his hand from its head, and if it is in the upper abdomen, he should raise its tip and its opening from below.
Also, if the wound is in one of the sides of the abdomen, make your aim and purpose always to raise the side containing the incision from the other side. It is therefore necessary to use it in major surgeries and in midline surgeries.
As for small surgeries, place it on as you can, then summon an assistant who is skilled to hold the entire incision with his hands and close his eyes. Then, he will uncover what is needed by the sewer after one thing after another.
This is the general stitching property: take a single thread or multiple threads according to the size of the wound, then leave from one side the amount of skin length, and sew a single thread without enclosing it with thread in the skin fold. The four layers (of skin and wound) are sewn together tightly with a strong thread until the wound edges meet in a firm union.
Then, leave the amount of skin length again and sew another thread, then interlace it with the previous thread as you did with the first one. Continue this process with as many threads as needed until the wound is completely filled, and the thread should be in the middle between the skin edges and the flesh.
Since the tightly drawn thread cuts both the flesh and the skin quickly, and it is difficult to insert into the skin, therefore it should be in the middle between the skin edges and not too close to them.
In order to avoid cutting the flesh too quickly and opening the wound before suturing, and also not to distance stitching so as not to prevent the wound from healing, then cut the ends of the thread to avoid hurting the patient during sleep and making it beneficial for him to have a cataplasm on both sides of the suture.
Leave it until you learn that incision has been sewn, and this kind of suturing with catgut is more suitable for minor surgeries because it may suffice in its suturing with one or two or similar catguts.
For the second method of suturing, it is to gather four stitches, namely the skin and subcutaneous tissue stitches in one go with a catgut containing a loosened evenly-sized thread and knot. Then, when you sew these four stitches with this catgut, draw the catgut from the side where it started.
The thread is to be entwined at the top of the incision so that the suturing is based on the suture of the intestine, which is the most suitable and leaves a gap between each stitch and the next one by pricking the small finger. This type of suturing is known by all people.
With this suturing, a surgery was performed on a man in the abdomen who had been cut with scissors and the incision was wider than a wound, and approximately fifteen pieces of excrement had come out from the middle of the intestine, and the incision was in the center of the abdomen.
He fell ill outside the wound after keeping his wounds open for four and twenty hours, then the wound healed in about fifteen days and was treated until he recovered and lived many years thereafter, managing all of his affairs, and physicians ruled that he should not be castrated.
It is surprising that I did not treat him with my remedy as I was in a place without any medicine, so I put cotton wool on the wound twice a day and pledged to wash it with honey water until it healed.
And among the specific types of stitching, I will relate on the authority of Galenos that one should start sewing from the skin and bring the suture from outside to inside, so if the suture passes through the skin and the tender flesh that extends along the length of the abdomen, then...
Leave the end of the suture on the side into which you inserted the suture and pass it out through the other suture from inside to outside in the other suture from the incision, so if you pass it out, pass another one through the same suture from outside to inside.
"Make an incision with the scalpel on this side and insert a probe into the opposite incision from inside to outside, and make an incision with your probe in the scrotum up until you pierce it all.
"Then, start from this side with your eyes and draw a line with the incision that is on the other side of the scrotum and bring out the probe from the skin nearby, then return it to that same skin and make an incision in the other part of the scrotum along with this incision.
"Take it out from the skin on that side, and do this again until you stitch the incision completely in that example, and the nature of this sewing is to sew the linen for the shroud.
"The scrotum should be stitched once from one side with the skin and left on the other side until empty, as for the second type of special sewing mentioned by Galenus, this is his language.
"It should be stitched in a way that physicians of a certain group join each problem part together by nature, so we gather the incision of the scrotum to the opposite incision and the incision of the scrotum to the opposite incision and this will be according to what has been stated.
It is required that the needle be threaded in the handle of the cautery, which is close to you from outside and pushed into it singularly, then releasing the handle. Then the needle should be withdrawn from outside to inside in the handle of the cautery again, both times and withdrawn again.
The needle should be pushed from inside to outside in the other handle, which is opposite, and this strike is better than the usual simple stitching and it's called the Galenic suture, and some of them have said that abdominal suturing can be done with two needles. It is to insert a thread in both of them and start by pushing the needle from you and push it towards the other side, then the other needle should be inserted from the opposite side and pulled from you according to the suture of the waterproof bag (ascites).
Know that if the wound is in the center of the abdomen, then suturing it is harder than other parts of the abdomen. As for cutting the bowel, its judgement is like that of other surgeries and that is, if you touch the wound cleanly with blood before it changes with air and discharge pus, mark it and judge it, then apply the plasters (dressings).
If the wound has been affected by air, lay on it some poultices until it purges and the pus drops out and the suppuration subsides, then treat it as you would any other surgical wounds until it heals.
If no medicine is available, lay on it cotton wool from the beginning with purging until it heals. Change the cotton wool twice a day as you know, until it heals. In most cases, additional treatment is not necessary if the surgical wounds are simple. However, if you fear that the main joints will share in the pain.
It is necessary to soak cotton in warm, balanced oil or lard and place it around the areas between the armpits and groin, if you feel pain or swelling in these areas. In many cases, this can help alleviate the problem. If the problem persists, drink a strong black decoction.
If the swelling has reached the wound and it has become an opening to the depths, know that what is thicker in the affected area is easier to heal, while what is thinner is harder to heal.
As for the famous anesthetic known as scramble, it does not accept the scarification before surgery that contains a graft and this is due to its abundance of vessels and bones, and the grit in it, and its proximity to the nature of nerves. And if the one who was wounded from the incision healed naturally, then place him according to your scramble anesthetic method.
If it (the wound) has passed a period and has turned either green or black, it is necessary to stitch it in the place that is black from it to prevent bleeding since there are vessels and veins in the incision. Then cut what remains of the sutures.
Make the ends of the thread project from below the surgery, outside it to make it easier for you to tie and remove it when the scramble falls out and the wound is healed. Mention the incision that is exposed in the anesthetic, and if a hole appears in the anesthetic which is small.
If a person is forced to undergo surgery because he has a stab wound in his abdomen, which was from the right side of the umbilicus, then wait for the wound to heal and be cautious not to scarify him. I have not cauterized the area until it has bled and clotted, then when I saw that it had clotted, I feared that something bad might happen to him internally. However, no such harmful event occurred, and he remained in his best condition. He eats, drinks and mixes [medicines] and enters the bath and enjoys himself in service, and some of the experienced people have mentioned that when a wound appears in the lower abdomen, it is better to cover it with this characteristic.
He takes large bees, then crushes their heads, then a piece of the crushed bee is placed on the wound, and if it sticks and does not dissolve, another piece is placed nearby.
Keep doing that with the number of bees proportional to the wound, then press and suture the wound. These heads remain sticky in the abdomen until the abdomen heals without any harmful event occurring, and it is also possible to stitch the abdomen with fine thread.
The one who is skilled in applying the adhesive to animals after they have been placed in a box. He takes a piece of this thread from the adhesives, and when it becomes sticky, he ties it with a thin, strong string, then introduces this thread into the box. In him, the Mascaran thread is wound around [it], then he turns it to the cavity. This blow is from embroidery with a needle and Mascaran thread, which is only on the path of hope and supplication.
If the wound is large and wide, and it is not in one of the joints, there is no trickery or cause for alarm.
Sixteenth Chapter.
Treatment of Ulcers and Pustules.
Know that every wound or tumor which becomes ulcerated, emerges, and persists in bleeding continuously without stopping is called by the collective name "pustules" or "ulcers", whichever limb it may be in; we call them "ulcers" or "pustules".
It is true that a swollen, white mass without pain has a hollow resembling the beak of a bird.
Therefore, some of them are called "beaks", and they may be moist and continuously bleeding, or the moisture may stop at times; this moisture may be abundant in some cases, scanty in others, thick in some instances, thin in others.
It has been stated in the classification of surgeries that every ulcer which does not heal and grows no flesh inside it, is due to one of the following reasons: either the blood is scarce in the body, or it may be covered (by something), or there may be a piece of hard meat inside it preventing the growth of good flesh. The injury may be numerous wounds and fractures, or because the cut is within itself putrid, or because the substance applied to it is not suitable for treatment, or because of corruption that has occurred in the city from the kind of wolves, or because of a specific problem in the city.
The injury may be numerous wounds and fractures, or because the cut is within itself putrid, or because the substance applied to it is not suitable for treatment, or because of corruption that has occurred in the city from the kind of wolves, or because of a specific problem in the city. The disease may be complicated in the city of Saragossa, where it is difficult to treat because of obstruction in urinary tracts, or perhaps because there is one or multiple bones involved. All these causes and their signs and remedies with medicines have been proven.
It is necessary here to inform you about the treatment of nausor and zakam, which is performed by hand. Know that the nausirs may occur in all parts of the body, some of which end up in large arteries or veins, or in nerves.
They may end up in a scar, or into an abscess, or into the liver, or into the gallbladder, or into a fissure among the fissures (the anal fissures), or into a crack of the back, or into a joint among the joints such as the hand and leg, and they may approach close to the limb of the head and so on.
If any of these conditions (sic) were of this nature, it is one of the incurable diseases, namely, pemphigus which does not accept treatment and working with it is a waste of effort and ignorance. If any of the conditions did not reach these mentioned places that have been described and hoped for in their cure.
To learn this, take a probe made of copper or iron if the patient is stable; then examine him with it. If there is any lump in the patient, examine it with a sharp lead probe as lead softens the body.
When entering, it pulsates towards the lump; if there is a swelling in the patient, do not probe all of them but instead press one of his mouths gently and water will flow from the other mouths as moisture that you pressed with it will spread to the other mouths and become less.
From it (the probe), then proceed to examine in any direction where you can determine whether there is a bone, nerve or if the swelling is far away or near; stop at all of that with an amount equal to your knowledge and information about the pain when you press the site with your hand.
Among the indications and causes of a pain, if all these have been examined and the truth has been established, then at this point one should resort to treatment with certainty. If it is present.
The Nasir is apparent near or in a safe place distant from the scrotum, anus, vagina, or any of the places that I have mentioned for you. If this occurs as described, remove what is inside it of pus, rotten flesh, and excess flesh.
If it develops in the mouth from flesh or pus, or similar to this and treatment is necessary until it bursts, if the Nasir is far from the anus and remains stable, one should pierce it as deeply as possible then cleanse it of all rotten flesh.
Then apply the warm fomentation on the medicine to the nasir which you have reached with iron, do this repeatedly until the medicine eats away all that remains of rottenness in the nasir.
Then force it with incisions that promote healthy flesh to burst until it does so, if this is not achieved, continue pressing according to the description given. If the cause of the nasir is bone and it is sound in your knowledge, probe it and pierce it as you have been informed, unless there is something preventing you from doing so.
If you discover a bone, muscle or limb that we have previously mentioned and there is some corruption and decay in it, remove it until the corruption goes away, then treat it with whatever heals it until it is cured. If it does not heal and the putrefaction persists as it usually does, do as before.
Know that you have not reached all the decay, so dig around it and remove all that is over it, then clean and purify it with great effort, then press it. If it heals or not, know that this decay is in a remote place from the decay, then dig around it again.
Clean and purify it with great effort, as the decayed bone was a small one and could be easily pulled out, so pull it out using thin tweezers suitable for that purpose.
If there were many bones, remove them all and do not leave anything of them. If resistance is encountered from the ligaments without any danger in it or if they are not in the piece, cut those ligaments and the flesh, and clean the bone.
If it is not possible for you to remove the bones in time, apply cautery to the wound and leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh and ligaments become soft, then carefully make an incision in that spot which you had cut earlier during your work. Keep the wound from being contaminated by any dirt or pus.
If you fear that, place upon it a bandage soaked in pulverized sulfur with oil, or a bandage soaked in Egyptian pitch or one of the green pitches; when it has softened those bands and loosened the bones, it will be easy to extract them and draw them out.
If one bone, such as the shinbone or thighbone, etc., has been broken and only a part of it is damaged, separate that part through wide traction until the discoloration and damage disappear; then force the fracture. However, if a large part of the bone is damaged and the injury has reached the marrow, there is no other option but to set the bone with splints (nashr).
Cut it all the way until the damage stops, then treat it until it heals; I have heard of a man who was lame in his leg to serve as an example for your case. This man had suffered from this incident recently.
About thirty years ago, a man suffered from pain in his leg due to movement within the body causing substances to reach the leg and cause intense swelling and severe pain; however, there was no external cause. Time passed with incorrect treatment by doctors until the abscess opened.
From it emerged numerous materials, and it was difficult to treat them until the wound became suppurative and multiple openings appeared in it, all of which discharged pus and the body began to rot. A group of physicians, including the elderly and those lacking skill in surgery, attempted to treat it.
Until I reached the wound, I observed numerous openings from which pus flowed out in large quantities and the man's body was rotting away, turning pale. I inserted a probe into one of the openings, then probed all of them.
I found them discharging pus into each other from all sides of the wound. I made an incision on one of the openings, and upon probing, I discovered decayed bone that was black, soft, decomposed, and hollowed out, and the hole reached the marrow. The rottenness spread as I uncovered what I had found.
I was able to remove the decayed bone, and I believed that there was no other decay in the bone besides what I had cut and spread out. Then I compelled the wound to heal with caustic medicines for a longer period, but it did not improve. After waiting, I uncovered another piece of bone above the first incision.
Found corruption connected to the bone, then what appeared of that corruption also spread. I compelled it forcefully, but it did not yield and nor did pressure. Then I probed him again, still he did not give way without cutting a piece from the bone here and there and burning it. He did not yield until I cut into the bone near a marrow cavity.
I extracted him with force, then compelled him with medicine which yielded quickly and released it. However, this procedure had to be repeated due to the patient's weakness and low probability of success, and fear of death as it happened to him at all times because of excessive negligence hiding his pain and fearing release causing further complication.
A hard tumor grew in the bone and its condition improved in his body, his strength returned and he regained control of himself, and he was not exposed to any dangerous limping affecting the buttock. If a bone is broken at a location in the body, it may be fractured.
It should be spread out in this manner, meaning that a ligature is taken and tightened on the side of the broken bone, and one is commanded to pull it upwards. The second ligature made of strong sinew is then tied.
Then tie it onto the flesh beneath the bone, and stretch its side to draw the flesh downwards so that you can expose the location where you intend to incise without injuring the flesh by the saw. Place a splint or flat piece of bone firmly underneath the bone from below.
If you do that, the saw will not cut away the bad bone, and it is important that the incision be made slightly above the site of the bad bone so as to avoid hollowing out the bone during the incision. This may necessitate making another incision if it does not appear on the surface for palpation.
If the bone is rotten and not separated but there is decay in the middle or part of it, expose all sides of the flesh then place a splint from below. Incise from the first side where the decay is.
If you have finished incising from one side, incise from the other side. The incision should be a little distance away from the decay as mentioned earlier. If the decay is in a separated part, separate the rotten part and incise the bone where it joins from the other side.
If the decay is in a joint (e.g., shoulder or knee), treatment is very difficult, but it is important to drill the decay so that what appears to you can be removed and cleaned regardless of its condition.
In what manner may a surgeon perform [the operation] when you are not resistant to pain or sensation, and know that many divisions and saws are used for cutting these bones according to their position and setting them, smoothing them, splitting them, thinning them, hardening them, and fracturing them. It is necessary for each type of work to have a tool specifically for that work.
Know that the works themselves may lead to a type of tool required for them, if you have a long arm and knowledge of these crafts, because mastery of this craft and observation of diseases are part of it. A tool for each disease may be necessary for itself, and I am drawing for you in the end of this chapter various tools.
Make them models that you can measure with them against others, by the grace of God, a picture of a saw:

The seventh and eighth section.
On cutting edges and scraping bones.
If the edges swell due to an external or internal cause, and if treating the problem with medication does not work and the swelling continues to progress in the limb without reducing it:.
It is necessary to amputate the affected limb to the point where the swelling reaches, in order to save it from death or a great suffering that exceeds losing the limb. A sign of this is that the limb turns black as if it had been burned by fire.
"Or it may be that the abscess extends beyond the flesh until it reaches the affected limb and takes its place within the body's cavity, causing division of it; similarly, if the corruption is due to the injection of certain fluids such as venom from sea urchins or scorpions or the like.
"If the corruption or abscess is in the fingertip, cut off the fingertip and do not delay as the corruption may reach the hand; similarly, if it takes place in the hand, cut off the arm from its root and do not delay as the corruption may reach the upper arm.
"Similarly, if it takes place in the arm, cut off the arm at the joint itself; for if the corruption is seen to advance towards the shoulder, do not amputate the entire shoulder but rather apply another treatment within your ability.
"Similarly, act on the leg if corruption takes place in the foot, cut off the foot at one of the ankles; and if it takes place in the middle of the leg, cut off the leg at the joint of the knee. If it ascends to the calf, then cut off the lower leg at the ankle.
"If the corruption has reached above the calf, there is no remedy except to leave it and let the patient die; cutting or incising the limb would only aggravate the situation and worsen the condition in both the affected and surrounding areas.
The attendant of the one rope pulls it downwards, and the attendant of the other rope pulls the upper one upwards, and you (the flesh) is pulled between the ropes with a broad stick until all the flesh is revealed, then it is to be cut or burned. It is necessary that from every direction incisions are made into the bone.
In order that the saw does not touch the correct position, it exposes the patient to excessive pain and severe burns, if bleeding occurs during your operation, move quickly or apply some hemostatic agents to the blood then return to your treatment until you are finished.
Then bind the cut limb with ropes that suit it and treat it until it heals, and I will tell you an example of a man presenting himself in this position with his eye which had been injured, and that is because it happened in his leg, swollen with burning resembling fire.
That injury was the first thing that happened in his hand until the man took all of them, and when he saw the injury he hurried to the limb with great pain, but could not find any relief from pain or burning, then it was cut at the joint and it healed.
After a long time had passed, he presented that injury to me with his swollen hand, and I pointed out the remedy for it by mixing drugs on the hand that carried the wound after cleaning his body, but the remedy did not work and he tried again with the other hand.
Until the corruption (spread) in the hand, he begged me to amputate his hand. He feared from my favor due to that excellence and also was afraid of his death during the amputation as the man's strength had fallen. When I refused, he left for his country.
It was reported to me that he became cured (of leprosy) and amputated his hand with a tourniquet, then he recovered. I narrate this story as a means of help for those suffering from such disease, and also as an example to be followed and acted upon.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
On the treatment of abscesses and how to inject them with medications.
If a tumor occurs in one of the fleshy limbs and the duration of the tumor persists until it has accumulated, then either explodes or swells and all that was within it comes out, leaving the site empty as if it were an empty vessel.
The skin that is as hard as a boil, if it has not reached corruption (spread) in bone, muscle or nerve, it should be called an abscess and not a fistula unless its duration persists until the corruption affects one of these parts.
At this moment, it is called Nasura or Zakama. Its treatment is to cut the entire skin all around it, and without doubt, if it has erupted and turned into a boil, you can be certain that it will not adhere back to its place due to corruption.
If you hope that the skin can adhere back and has not yet reached corruption, the part of the skin with a nodule in it from meat, its treatment is to lance (it). Look at the abscess, if it is big and there is a foul smell emanating from it, then lance it with Egyptian medicine.
That which is clarified oil, olive oil, honey and resin mixed in a container, boiled until the medicine thickens into honey-like consistency. Then take your required amount, make it warm with water and honey, lance the abscess with it, push down firmly, leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then, extract it in the evening and repeat this process for days until the abscess is clean and the pus disappears. If this medicine is not available to you, you can lance with warm water from wood charcoal or willow twigs.
Then clean it and rub it with soap until you are sure that the wound has been cleaned, if not, there is no hope for the Egyptian medicine or water of ashes. So rub it with water mixed with honey to which something from powdered chalk has been added.
Rub it with honey and water, as the property of honey is to clean and wash, and water penetrates the wound well, especially if the water contains oil and honey. If you do this several times and are sure that the wound's decay has gone, rub it with something that meat grows in.
Take some soft-stemmed celandine, clean it with oil and water, or use some of the other remedies whose properties have been proven in the article on remedies. If there is tightness in the wound that cannot accommodate a probe.
Spread it with iron a little or put in it some of the Egyptian celandine or sorrel until it expands. And likewise, if the mouth is also wide, gather your eyes together with sewing and leave on it an amount that can be probed without excess.
And similarly, if the phlegm rises in the throat to a high place and it breaks in a lower position, it allows the phlegm to descend, because if phlegm accumulates in the cavity of the chest, it prevents the meat from growing there.
If it is not possible for you to break the chest cavity downwards as desired, then form a hole in such a way that the phlegm can easily be expelled from it without anything from the thick phlegm blocking it.
As for the medicinal substance that is placed on the chest from outside and how it should be applied, it is to take a problematic, medicinal substance and insert it into a hollow reed such that the reed is as wide as needed to fill the entire chest cavity. Then, you should hold a small bag over the chest cavity's opening, which is slightly wider than the chest cavity's mouth. Next, you should gently insert a soft reed into another hole on the bag in accordance with the size of the opening and place it there, spaced away from the mouth of the chest cavity to facilitate the exit of phlegm and not remove the large reed immediately.
The number of days, and as for the one on the chest cavity, it is the one that should be removed at every instance to let out whatever accumulates in it from phlegm, and to know if anything from the pus coming out from it is abundant or scarce or thick or not.
With this also, if the wound heals itself, does its owner feel pain in it or is there no pain in it? Is there pus or no pus in it, and is there an abscess or not an abscess? If your treatment proceeds thus, and you observe the material that is easily expelled from the wound of the abscess.
Know that the abscess has healed or is near healing, then open it tomorrow or on the third day and find out when the wound has healed. If you have replaced the probe with another one and renewed the dressing, if something comes out of the abscess after a long time, do not worry about its smell.
Its putrefaction is near, for among people there are those who spoil the flesh in their wound and others do not, if something comes out of the abscess after several days, it is not pus but corruption; therefore, know that the abscess has not healed, and the corruption indicates that it will not heal.
The matter has been prolonged, so increase in the drying of the medication and make it such that it remains wet within its container but dry in its potency like mature honey. If there is an excess, add more alum. The most effective remedy for what is treated with it is to use mature honey.
"It is permitted to use lard and tallow (rendered fat) for anointing, and to rub them with pure alcohol that has been distilled in its container, then knead it and apply it. If fresh honey is not available, you may boil vinegar until it turns white and use or take from the lees, sediment, wine lees, grape marc, and press them together, then leave them on the honey that is over the fire. "Then it is kneaded and left on the bandage, or it can be anointed with honey that has been boiled until it clarifies, and then garlic cloves are placed on it.
"Long cinnamon sticks, the bark of the cassia tree, crushed saffron and quinces can be used individually or combined, crushed, strained and added to the clarified honey described above, for use in treatment. If the bandage is left too long without improvement, know that rot has set in.
"It has been found effective on bones or other hard tissues or ligaments, treating them with the treatment of Nasir.
"The ninth and thirtieth chapters" (Title of a section)
In treatment of fistula, elephantiasis and superfluous nails, as well as cutting of the overgrown joints.
Fistula (Daḥs) is a thick growth that appears under the swollen part of the hand or leg, or in other fingers. If it persists for a long time and treatment is delayed, it leads to inflammation and severe pain.
Ulceration and necrosis may extend to the point of eating away at the bone, or the ulceration may spread to the entire area, reaching the bone until it has a foul odor, the finger tip becomes exposed, and its color turns black. If treated as described in the previous section and it does not improve.
It is necessary to cut all the excess growths that originate from the fistula, then let it heal. In this case, cauterization is very beneficial. If the bone and the fistula are both healthy.
The angle of the fistula had enclosed the meat and pressed it, so it is necessary to place a narrow rod under the fistula that presses the meat and lift it up, then cut that meat with it.
Place burning, consuming medications on the remaining meat until it all disappears, then treat it with cauterization until it heals. If the ulceration has affected the bone, it is necessary to cut that bone and remove it because a dead bone does not heal.
If you see ulceration and corruption in the nail, cut it off in one of the nails of the little finger immediately as described, then treat it until it heals, but if it affects the big toe and there is a strong pain happening in it, first focus on removing the cause.
Then, cut the big toe nail obliquely and slightly from top to bottom but avoid cutting into the skin beneath the nail as you will cause sharp pain and it may lead to excessive growth of tissue in the area, then treat the wound appropriately.
Regarding the excessive nails that grow in some people, it may not be completely flesh-like, or there may be bone in some of them, or there may be a nail in which it grows separately from some other nails.
Or it may grow in some of the little fingers' nails that do not move, or grow next to the separation between the nails, and if it is not flesh-like, cut it at its root with a straight incision.
If it grows in the middle of the separation, treatment is difficult and requires removal, but if it grows near one of the nails' base, first cut off its flesh with a longitudinal incision, then spread the bone with one of the suitable chisels.
Then he should be treated until it [the wound] heals over, and as for the suture which exposes one finger to another, that often happens and it is one of the things that may cause harm to a person, especially due to injury or burning with fire and similar things; therefore, that suture should be broken.
Until the fingers return to their natural position, then place something between them such as a thread or suture soaked in oil of turpentine so that it does not adhere quickly and separate them or insert a thin lead wire until the wound heals properly.
And similarly, if the suture exposes one finger to the hand, break that suture as needed and let it heal in its proper shape.
Chapter Ten.
On amputation.
Amputation is the cutting of limbs that are mutilated, swollen and blackened in various parts of the body, and it most often occurs in fingers and toes, especially in feet and hands, and animals; therefore, one should first use strong poultices made from black mud several times.
Then separate the nails of the affected person, and as for treating it with iron, one should strike one of them so that it breaks and black blood and pus are released, while the other should be pressed gently until it breaks on its own. If it breaks on its own, then the finger can be immersed in hot water first.
Until the thick blood clot in the wound is dissolved, then press the finger of the healer from above and take it down to its base with forceps, then cut the artery in one place or two places or three wide cuts.
Then press the black blood from below the finger to above and from above to below until it is discharged, whatever amount can be seen or what the healer's strength allows, then tie it and order him to abstain from foods that cause blackness, and recovery and healing will return.
When the arteries are filled and it is caused by the healer, and if the finger is hairy, then cut it off in this way: immerse it in hot water until it turns red or undergoes a strong exercise.
If no hot water is available to heat the limb, then cut the skin around the artery in length either at its end near the joint or at its base near the bone, then open the skin with scissors and remove the artery from all sides until it can be felt.
When it becomes red, it appears reddish-brown and if removed from the skin, it appears like a worm. Then insert a probe under it until it rises and comes out of the skin, then tie it with a thin cord, and cut off the remaining part near that cut in three fingers' breadth.
Then he incises the skin from over the artery until it appears, then lifts it with forceps as you did and sutures it with another suture as you did first, then cuts it again or makes multiple small incisions if necessary.
Then he stitches and cuts it at the end of the incision near the bone, then pulls it out from the second incision, then draws it towards the first incision and repeats this until it is pulled out from all the small incisions above them, until all are pulled out. Then he cuts it.
If pulling and stitching is not required, insert a strong wire with thread and tie it and draw it in while holding the forceps under it and apply pressure with your hand to all sides until it comes out without breaking. If it breaks, it will make suturing difficult.
If the ulcer is infected, if you stitch all of it, place it on a dressing soaked in oil or fat and ointment, and treat it until it heals. If the wound is inflamed and swollen, apply poultice to it at various angles.
If it is not as straight as we mentioned earlier, it should be incised at each angle of the wound and the sites of the ulcers, then sutured with forceps until they are stitched together. Make sure not to cut or injure the artery during your incision as this will make suturing difficult for you.
Image of the forceps that fractures bones.
Image of the iron ligator.
The pincers should not have sharp tips to avoid cutting the vessels, and its edge should not be pointed so as not to wound the artery. It should rather be stout for it is better, if it is sharp, it cuts the artery with its sharpness, but it should rather have a sturdy advantage as we said,.
The first and fortieth section.
In the vein of the artery (arterial vein).
This artery is born in the hot countries such as Hijaz, Arab countries and the few hot desert countries where it is buried shallowly, and perhaps it is born in other parts of the body besides the veins, and it is born from a rupture that occurs under the skin.
As it happens inside living animals and intestines, the artery that bursts occurs between skin and meat, and a sign of its beginning is that it occurs in the vein which burns intensely, then the site expands, and then the artery begins to come out from the expanding site.
It is as if it were the root of a plant or animal, and when its side appears, it should be cut with a piece of lead from a dirhem to two dirhems and then ligated, leaving the lead attached to the vein.
Whenever something comes out of it to the outside, let it be tied with a thread in copper wire; if it is long, cut off part of it and tie the rest, do not cut it from its root before it all comes out, because if you cut it, it will shrink and enter into the flesh causing inflammation, abscess and suppuration at the site and a painful ulcer.
Therefore, it is advisable to apply gentle pressure little by little until it comes out completely and nothing remains in the body. It may come out from this abscess in some people that is five or ten fingers long.
It is reported that a man had an abscess twenty fingers long, if it were cut during your treatment for him, mucus would enter the wound and block it for a long time with the body until everything inside it is discharged of its matter and try to cure the site with medicine for several days.
Then treat it with treatment for boils, and this abscess may have many hairs and if it appears on the thigh or on the same leg itself, it will cause many openings and it will come out from every pore a hair; treat it as we mentioned in the division and according to what follows.
Chapter Twenty-nine.
In an incision on the ulna (dod) that is born beneath the arm, it is called a fracture of the cow (alla al-bahr).
This disease is called 'fracture of the cow' in some countries because it often occurs in cows, and it is a small and single ulna (dod) bone that develops between the skin and the flesh, growing upwards and downwards throughout the entire body.
It becomes perceptible to the touch from one bone to another until it penetrates, but where it does not penetrate in the skin, it emerges and becomes an abscess of some mixture, as it is susceptible to ulna (dod) and animals, and there may be worms in the abdomen.
And if it grows in the body and reaches the head, it rarely opens up and comes out, thus spoiling the eye, and this often occurs. If you wish to treat and extract it, then it can only be done when it becomes perceptible to the touch and appears to the senses.
It is necessary to press on what is above and below it firmly, then make an incision on it and extract it. If it is hidden in the flesh and not found, it should be burned at the location using fire until it is burnt, and make sure to prevent any damage to the eye as much as possible, as we have said.
If you find it (the stone) in the head near the eye, press hard under it on the forehead, then break and remove it. It is important that the person who suffers from it cleanses his body with easy-to-mix medicines for softening and dissolving the stone, and avoids foods that cause stones.
The third and forty-ninth section.
In breaking on the disease that is known as naphr.
This disease known as naphr in our land is a toothache which occurs in certain body parts and then moves from one part to another. You have seen it on what has been described to you.
Call a women affected by this disease in one of the valleys and, when she has revealed her arm, blow gently into the vein of the arm. After an hour, you will see that the gas rises like a serpent to its neck at the fastest possible speed, like quicksilver.
If you move the toothache from one place to another, it remains in the neck and settles there, then sit for an hour and it will spread throughout the body until it reaches the other arm, then you will find that her entire body is rotating as you have seen.
Surprised by the swift transition from one limb to another, I had never seen this ailment with my own eyes in such a way on this type of person, except that I saw a group finding pain moving from one limb to another, and I did not see it as clearly as I saw it in this woman.
I was able to do that only because the woman was one of the bald and emaciated, with her veins exposed. From here, it appeared as though the wind was moving, a transition that should not be observed on those with expertise in healing and soft, hidden organs.
If you wish to treat the pain and sense it, then if it appears before your eyes as we have described, then press firmly upon it and on top of it with a needle and pierce it until the trapped wind is released from its place.
If you do not sense it, treat the pain by softening the flesh and expelling the wind and dissipating it like camphor, sandalwood, and similar medicines, ...
The fourth and fiftieth section.
On the extraction of gallstones.
Gallstones may vary in size and location within the body, and as for their differences based on types, some are large or small, some are hollow or solid, and some have three corners while others have four.
From it (the body) some have a tongue, and from it some have hard parts, but as for the one that is in accordance with the limbs that are within it, it will be on joints, either because the limbs are of a straight head like the skull, heart, liver, neck, kidneys, breast, lungs and similar (to them). When a fracture occurs in one of these limbs and signs of death appear to you, I will explain them to you later, it is necessary not to remove that fracture from it as death usually occurs for its owner in most cases. If these signs of death do not appear to you and the fracture is not open in the limb, remove it and treat the wound. Among the signs of skull fracture are if a fracture occurs, bone breaks out, and the parietal bone (located on the skull) is injured as it can cause severe pain, swelling, and bruising.
If these signs of death do not appear to you and the fracture is not open in the limb, remove it and treat the wound. Among the signs of skull fracture are if a fracture occurs, bone breaks out, and the parietal bone (located on the skull) is injured as it can cause severe pain, swelling, and bruising. Redness in the eyes and tongue swelling, confusion, loss of consciousness (for a brief period), and possibly bleeding from the nostrils or ears, and speech may stop or the voice may disappear, and pus-like white fluid may come out from the wound site that resembles cottage cheese, and it will flow like meat broth.
If these signs appear for you, refrain from treating the cause and extracting the thorn unless it does not come out, as for the signs of a thorn: if the heart is present and it is near the left armpit and it feels as if it has been trapped in something hard but not in something empty.
And perhaps for the thorn, there is a movement similar to the pulse and bleeding black blood follows the wound, with the surrounding areas becoming cold, a pale color appearing, and the patient feeling faint - then know that death is imminent and unavoidable. A sign of a thorn is if the head is wounded, white blood comes out from the wound.
The symptoms that follow the neck are trembling and the color of the affected area changes, breathing becomes high-pitched, and the patient seeks cold air. If a thorn is in the chest, it will be near small openings and the breathing will become very intense with severe pain.
All the limbs shake, and if a thorn is in the liver, it will follow that with severe pain and blood resembling liver-colored will come out from the wound. If a thorn is in the spleen, perhaps something other than food will come out from the wound.
If the hernia is manifest and if there is pain in the abdomen and something comes out from the wound or rupture or protrusion, which has penetrated [the body], there is no hope in its treatment or in the removal of the hernia. If the hernia is located in the bladder and urine comes out.
If something comes out from a hernia and the pain increases, it is evident that it will perish. As for other parts like the face, eyes, neck, arms, back, legs, feet, and similar organs, they will surrender to fate.
When the hernia does not occur with pain or poisoning and it is not affected, I will inform you about a case of this type of hernia in the eye socket near the nostril.
I extracted the first one from the other side below the ear and there was no harm in his eye, and I also extracted a second hernia from a Jew who had it in the lower eyelid and the hernia was twisting and only a small part of it adhered to the bone.
The piece was large among the pieces of the compound surgical instrument, squared iron forceps without ears. The Jew's hand did not touch it, and no ill event happened in his eye, and another piece was extracted from a Christian's scalp, and the piece was Arabic.
He who had ears, I pierced between them with forceps and he had been scalded on his scalp so I soothed him until I extracted it (the foreign body). The Christian gave thanks and was safe, and another piece was extracted from the man who had been stabbed in his abdomen; we expected that he would die from it.
After thirty days or so, and nothing changed in his condition, I pierced the piece and it changed (in shape) and extracted it, he was safe and no ill event happened to him, I saw a man who had a piece in his chest, so I operated on the wound.
After seven days, the piece came out in its essence, and I saw a woman who had been stabbed with a piece in her abdomen, and the piece remained and nothing changed in her condition or caused her any harm in anything of her natural actions.
You see a man who has recently sustained an injury on his face, with a fracture of the jaw and yet he feels little pain. Such cases are numerous. I have extracted the fractured portion of the jaw for one of the commanders of the caliph, who had sustained it in the middle of his nose, slightly towards the right side.
I extracted all the fractured pieces and advised him to wait for three days before treating it. Upon examination, I found that the jawbone was tightly bound with a narrow crack from which I did not feel any pain. However, he suffered great discomfort and severe swelling under his right ear.
I hoped that the swelling was from the fractured side, so I pressed on the spot with a strong splint to make it throb, hoping that it would inflame and reveal the fracture site. But nothing happened in the spot that could indicate the fracture had reached there.
I continued to press on the spot for several days but nothing happened, so the wound was sealed off. However, after a while, I felt the fracture within his nose and informed the patient about it. I then placed a sharp, edible medicine on the wound for several days.
Until it opened and the sinew adhered to the sharp point that sticks in the wood, then you increased in making the incision with that sharp drug until the edge of the sinew appeared to us with eyes, and it stayed away from us for a duration similar to four months.
When the incision was widened and the bladder entered it, I drew it towards me and moved it, but it did not respond to the exit, so I did not force it harshly, and I transformed it with blows from the instruments until it was captured by strong forceps according to its appearance in the last part of the procedure.
The doctors used to say that neck veins should not be tightened, but I tightened it and closed the incision, and made the patient urinate smoothly without any pain from the catheter, and I will inform you about the method of extracting some tendons to make this a measurement and evidence for what I did not mention.
These parts of this art and their details cannot be fully described or covered by a book, only the skillful craftsman judges according to the little and what is apparent, and he fills in what is missing and performs new work and a new device during the strange circumstances.
If you depart from this craft, I say that a hernia only comes out of the members which have ruptured in two ways, either by attraction from the place it came out from, or by resistance against the other side, and it comes out where it entered.
Either a hernia is projected in a place with fatty tissue, where it will be attracted and come out. If it did not require exit immediately upon its occurrence, it is necessary that you wait for days until the surrounding flesh relaxes to facilitate its attraction and removal. Similarly, if it ruptures in bone.
If it does not require immediate exit, leave it for days and attempt to attract it and move it every day as it will come out. If it did not require exit after several days, you should drill around the hernia in the same bone from all sides with a thin drill until it expands, then attract it and remove it.
If the hernia that ruptured is in the skull bone and has penetrated one of the skull's cavities and some of those symptoms you have been informed about appear, stop attracting the hernia and leave it until the situation resolves after several days.
If the thorn is deeply embedded and difficult to extract, then it is necessary to use a forceps around the thorn as I have described to you earlier, then treat the area until it heals. And if the thorn has pierced a body part. If he loses sensation, examine it with a probe. If you feel it, anesthetize it with one of the instruments suitable for anesthesia. But if you cannot tighten it due to its location in the depth and the thorn is not bone, nerve or artery.
Break it open until the wound expands and allows the thorn to be extracted. If it has tendons holding it, remove the surrounding flesh from all sides with every method you can manage. And if you cannot free the flesh in breaking the tendons, separate them by pulling apart until it is freed.
If you try to extract the thorn in any position, use pliers on all sides until it is freed and secure the tip of the pliers so as not to break the thorn when you anesthetize and extract it. But if you cannot do it at your convenience.
Leave it for certain days until the surrounding meat softens, then resume [the procedure]. If it resists bleeding, use the remedies mentioned in its treatment section, and keep your efforts from cutting a vein or nerve or tendon, and apply cautery.
In all cases, it is possible for you to remove the wound, and this should be done gently and carefully as described to you, and it is best for you to use a probe when drawing out the splinter so that its shape remains the same as it was when the splinter entered, which is more effective.
If it is not possible for you to do that, use what is available to you, and as for the splinter that comes out from the opposite side, either it has already protruded something outside or you find one side of the splinter by feeling it from above the skin nearby and see it protruding.
Break it open and let the crack be as wide as a fingernail, then draw it out, for that facilitates its removal. If it is stuck in bone, apply pressure to rotate it until the splinter affects the bone and widens itself, then draw it out.
"If it doesn't come out, leave it for days until it emerges, then if the pus persists in it, apply pressure on it. If the pus has fallen and you want to use pressure but the probe has fallen too, insert the straight instrument to enter its cavity, then apply pressure with it.
"If the pus is pointed, apply pressure with a straight instrument to that cavity as it eases the pus's exit. If the pus is poisonous, it is necessary to cauterize all the meat that has become affected by it if possible, then treat it accordingly.
"If the pus is located in the chest, abdomen, liver or side, and can be felt with a probe and it can be cut, then cut it out carefully while avoiding cutting any artery or vein and remove it.
"Then, suture the wound if necessary, then treat it until it heals, image of leeches that attract pus:
"Its edges are shaped like goose quills, it can be made in various sizes depending on the size and depth of the wound and its severity.

This is a probe for the oblique wound, to facilitate its entry and evacuation.
The Fifth and Sixtieth Chapter.
On the Ligation of Arteries.
The arteries that are usually ligated in the body are thirty, nine of which are located in the head. They include the two carotids behind the ears, commonly known as the common carotids, and the superficial temporal arteries, which are visible on the temples. There are also the arteries at the corners of the eyes, commonly referred to as the nashers (or observers).
These are the well-known veins: the central one in the forehead, the one at the side of the nose, the two in the neck, the ones in the upper eyelids and the lower eyelids, and those under the tongue.
The veins that are found in the arms and hands are five. One of them is known as the cephalic, which originates from the side of the neck (or axilla) and is commonly referred to as the head vein or subclavian vein. It consists of branches from the basilic and the cephalic. The common name for it is abdominal vein.
The basilic is found on the right side and is also known as the arm vein or axillary vein. It lies under the skin (or cephalic) and connects with it, appearing clearly above the elbow. The asylim is another one, which also appears above the elbow, but on the left side.
The vein that lies between the cubital and the basilic has two branches. In the foot and leg, there are three veins: one under the ankle on the right side, the saphenous, and the femoral vein on the left side for males, and the great saphenous vein on the left side for females.
In the little finger, there are three veins like them. As for the two veins behind the ears, it is beneficial to tie them off for the narrow veins, the shoelace vein, and the vein of the rounded skull, tied together. How to tie them off follows as described.
Wrap the toe of the little finger and twist it backwards to a position between the two veins, with a thick cord tightly twisted. Then press the little finger until the veins appear and are found behind the ears at their lower positions on the head. Probe them with your finger and where you feel their pulsation under your finger, cut there to learn about cauterization.
Then take a sharp instrument, which is known as the lancet, and insert it under the vein in the skin until it reaches the bone. Lift your hand with the vein and skin above, then cut the vein along with the skin, making an incision about the length of two joined fingers.
Or it may be done by drawing out the required amount of blood and then cauterizing them with hot iron or fire, leaving them until they heal, as it is mentioned at the beginning of the book that they are cut and tied off. As for the two veins in the wrist, it is beneficial to tie them off for the narrow vein, the shoelace vein, the persistent varicose veins, and the sharp ulcers located near the eyes.
Method of extracting them as you requested: The pain will stimulate his neck with a probe until the arteries appear clearly visible. Then, you feel their pulsation under your finger. At this point, you learn how to grasp (them), then lift the skin from the top of the artery upwards using your thumb.
Enter the probe from below and lift the artery to the top and flatten it as you did with other veins, then send blood according to your need. Then, cut off the neck of the patient and place your finger on the artery for a while.
Then put a tourniquet and press firmly and leave it until it becomes pale, and you may mention them (the two veins) and cut and tie them in the beginning of the book. As for extracting the vein on the forehead, it is beneficial after extracting the facial veins such as the temporal vein, the frontal vein, and the vein of the bridge of the nose.
Method of extracting it as you requested: You squeeze his neck with a probe until the artery appears, then you take the instrument that is called the "fas" (Ligation forceps) and its image is:.
Put the cautery, which is at the end of the fas (ligation forceps), on the artery and strike from above with a blow or something similar and leave the blood flowing according to your need, then cut off the neck of the patient and squeeze it until it becomes pale.
The opening should not be wide except that it should not be very narrow, for the bone is near and it might break if it is too thin.
Concerning the two aqueous humors in the front part of the eyes, it is beneficial for the health of the eye from injury, redness, inflammation, and facial diseases, and as for how to extract them, it is done by pressing the eyelid with tweezers then extracting them while you are standing on their tip, and the extraction should be in a slight upward direction with a small, slightly open cannula.
The location does not contain any meat, so if the opening is thin it might break, then send some of your blood and place a linen cloth over them, leave it for one night then clean them. As for draining the tears ducts, it is beneficial for discharge.
A severe toothache and some facial diseases such as a swollen red cheek, especially if it is swollen, its treatment is to press the eyelid then hold the nose with your left hand and take a thin, long cannula.
"Incise it in the middle of the rabbit, between the nostrils, with precision as the nose cartilage will not be felt here; blood will spurt from its hour and it is preferable that your hand grasp it slightly and send your need of blood then bind it (the wound) at night, for it will congeal quickly.
"Regarding the mole, it is beneficial to remove them if they are located near vital areas such as the neck and the throat and the black pimples, warts, moles, or freckles that appear on the skin surface; the method of removing them is by pressing the base of them firmly under their root with a string until the owner stops.
"The owner sits on a chair and the cartilage is pulled to an extended length, slightly widened, then blood is drawn from the appropriate amount or as needed, then this procedure is repeated with the other cartilages and finally the string is released.
"The cartilages are pressed firmly with moderate force so as not to hurt the owner and they are left for the next day, because it helps in healing the wound; as for the septum of the nose, it is beneficial to remove it because it helps in preventing cavities in the teeth, dental caries, warts, and eye disorders.
When they are in the nose or around it, here is how to extract them: Have the patient sit in front of you and press his forehead with your thumb. Then turn your eyes and look at the nostrils, where you will see one on the right side and the other on the left. Extract them from there with forceps.
And also, they are black boils around them. Extract them by cutting out the larger one first and then extract the smaller one. Do the same for the nostrils below.
As for the boils below the tongue, it is beneficial to extract them after extracting the fleshy growths that are in the gums from mouth diseases and mouth abscesses. Here's how to extract them: Have the patient sit between your legs facing the sun, raise his tongue and look under it on one side for a boil and on the other side for another boil, both of which are black in color.
Extract them and preserve them without cutting them, for it is possible that beneath them there are veins, so avoid causing bleeding from these veins. As for the three boils that you extract in the armpit, it has become common practice to extract them on two occasions.
It may be punctured with a thin reed or olive stick into the vein, or it may be incised with a sharp scalpel (nashl), which is its image [and here is its depiction]. This is the image of the wide reed vein.
It should be wide as you see to cure the stiff and obstructed veins, which are prominent on the surface and contain thick blood like oil, and this is the image of the olive stick vein.
This vein is narrower and sharper at the edges to relieve the stiff, narrow veins that contain thin, yellowish blood, and this is the image of the scalpel vein.
This scalpel (nashl) is used for incision and comes in various shapes and sizes according to the size and tightness of the veins, and it is well-known among craftsmen.
And as for the pulley vein, it is beneficial to relieve it because it draws blood from the areas that are below the incision and the neck up to the chest and abdomen. Therefore, when one wants to relieve it, he should be careful and keep watch over it because beneath it there are nerves, so if one makes a mistake by puncturing the vein, it will cut those nerves.
If bleeding occurs, it is not appropriate to try to stop it with a ligature on the artery but rather to open it with a probe. If pus does not appear clearly, one should avoid it and turn to something else or request assistance from a different person.
If bleeding occurs, it should not be stopped with a ligature on the artery but rather opened with a probe as we said earlier. If you want to stop it with your eyes, you must first locate the source of the bleeding before learning how to tie it off.
Then, tie the artery and cut it open slightly with a probe as we said earlier, and be careful that the blow is distant from the veins. When you see, after tying, a puff of air at the place where you learned to tie off, it means the vein has been punctured; avoid it.
If you see blood during probing, it should be cauterized like boiling water, and the blood is thin and red; this means it is from a vein. In that case, place your finger on it for a long time then remove it. If the bleeding stops, the artery will not bleed excessively.
Leave it, and warn the patient from negligence. It should be under observation and not moved until it hardens, unless bleeding stops spontaneously and medicine is not provided at that moment. If pus appears on you, know that its edges will shrink and bleeding will stop.
Take a bladder, break it and take one half of it. Press the other half firmly on the site of the wound with a strong bandage and keep it there for as long as necessary, unless bleeding stops. If bleeding persists, treat it with what has been mentioned regarding the placement of binding agents to stop the flow, and cut the blood without difficulty in most cases.
For a small wound and when the bandage can be used in the arm, know this. As for the cautery iron, it is beneficial to move it from the top of the head to the lower abdomen since it is made of a mixture of basilicum and cynidium as we have mentioned.
The one to be cauterized should be on his back, and below him there are nerves. If he is pricked in these nerves during cauterization, it causes pain that makes breathing difficult and sometimes it doesn't heal properly. This nerve is often visible to the touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is not discernible, one should make a deep incision with a scalpel at the site and avoid applying force, as the artery may be between two veins. If the artery is stretched out, make a long incision; however, for an obscure artery, it is beneficial to locate it because it draws blood from the head.
For eye diseases, it is particularly beneficial to locate the artery. If you intend to make an incision, do so with a narrow or wide leech, such as a lemon-tree leech or a sandalwood leech, because no nerves or veins lie beneath it.
Except that, when making an incision, you should avoid using the leech's head and seek a clear location instead. It will not be harmed even if it misses the first strike, but some people may become inflamed if they are not able to make the incision in the initial attempt.
However, the inflammation caused by it is of no consequence. As for the method of making an incision and its implications as well as what should be done to treat it first, this knowledge must be understood that the primary purpose of making an incision is to preserve health only.
If to be used for the diseases and that which is used for preserving health and its continuity, and for preventing the occurrence of diseases, it should be cautery in one of the three veins, namely the cephalic, the axillary, or the basilic, and if it should be done at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear.
Cautery should be on a Monday or Tuesday, after the day has passed three hours, and as for cautery used for diseases, it has no specific time but whenever the need and necessity arises from night or day.
In every hour and in every time, it is not appropriate to cauterize children until they reach fourteen years of age, and the elderly who have passed sixty years should not be cauterized. If anyone needs cauterization for any reason.
It is necessary to clean the wound before cauterization with a linen swab if there is much pus in it, so that it does not attract to the veins during cauterization from the wound, causing swelling which harms the main limbs, and cauterization should not be done on drunkards, lepers or the insane until they recover.
"One should also beware of bleeding after hemostasis in the case of hemorrhoids, ulcers, and fractures, as well as excess gathering of blood, fatigue, exercise, excessive eating and drinking, and fasting. Anything that weakens the body or the soul should also be avoided. Then, check for coagulation beforehand if the blood is thick.
"If possible, administer food and drink, or medicine, then the patient should bathe unless prevented by a specific reason or allowed to perform some exercise to stimulate blood flow and make bleeding easier in daylight, as we mentioned earlier, and it is advisable that he keeps his chest exposed from all harmful psychological factors during that day.
"As for the things that are usually employed in treating illnesses, such as incantations, the blowing of wind or other similar methods, each person should use them according to their ability.
"Then, the patient should sit on an elevated stool that is higher than the one used for the hemorrhoid, then he should take hold of his anus with one hand and press it twice or thrice, then he should tighten the ligature slightly and tie it twice or thrice ensuring the tightening is moderate.
When the incision is not properly done, either by being too deep which prevents blood flow or if it is tight which also prevents blood flow, then after the incision, it is necessary to loosen all the fingers held together with a tweezer.
It is necessary to inflate the veins and make them visible, then to wipe the affected area gently with warm oil, specifically, then to place the thumb of the left hand under the same vein where one wants to tie it slightly so that the vein does not collapse during the strike. Since some of the veins are prone to collapse during tying and others are filled with air, when the ligature is placed on them, they sink under the ligature and constrict, and if they open, it will only do so slightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to make sure that all these matters are done properly, then the ligature is lowered. If the vein opens during this process, it should be tightened again in the same place or slightly above it with the help of a screwdriver if there is no swelling at the site.
If the patient feels pain or swelling, leave it for a day or two and do not tie the ligature as it may cause severe pain and inflammation, and do not use heat. Then try tying again if desired, but if the vein opens slightly and blood flow is weak, tighten the ligature.
I fear that the desired amount may not come out of the vein, so prepare the artery again in the incision, have it attached firmly and increase slightly in the opening, do this with the drill before the site becomes inflamed; for in many people, the site becomes inflamed at a small opening.
If you see it becoming inflamed, do not keep pressing on it as it will not help you at all. Place something made of oil on it, for oil eases the flow of blood and is better in this situation than oil itself or other ointments.
Use oil in all your cuts when blood flow is obstructed, and it may relieve the pain and swelling if you apply one of them to the site; for blood will flow and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large abscess occurs in the incision and it is swollen, it often happens that nothing else will be effective but this or if the opening of the artery is small, then apply mustard paste dissolved in water and salt to it and leave it for an hour; for it will dissolve.
It should be done after the blood has come out of the artery completely or from another artery, if something remains in the site for days that is either black or green, it will not harm it; if you wish, apply something to relieve pain and swelling.
If a thing from the pulp of a fingernail or similar occurs and often results in worm or inflammation when extracting a splinter, place your hand on it. If you find it soft under your touch, it is bad. Be careful not to do anything with it that we have mentioned.
If it is blood from a cut, press it with whatever is available to solidify the area then treat it with various treatments until it heals. It is necessary that every person removes as much blood as their strength allows and what dominates the color on the blood.
If the blood is black, let it come out until it turns red. Similarly, if you see it becoming thick, send for it to be drained until it becomes soft and the hardness disappears. It is appropriate for those who are strong and need to remove blood that one removal should suffice.
The wider the incision, the more room for extracting the pus and it should be made broad if weak. However, care must be taken to ensure that it is extracted in multiple sessions and the wound should be tight. The best tool for draining pus is one that is curved and thin but not pointed.
This blow is smooth from the slicing and from cutting a bone, it is Ahmad and Aslam when scooping with width and length. If one usually applies gauze during scooping, it should be eaten before scooping something made of leavened dough in diluted alum water or skunk skins.
If it gushes blood in three or four repetitions and the patient is cold, take before surgery bread soaked in vinegar or honey with spices or good rose-flavored drink.
If bleeding occurs during surgery, and its cause is the large outflow of blood, it is necessary to drink meat broth and a thin rose-flavored drink. The use of spices should be applied to the chest and all that has been mentioned about it in the chapter on bleeding should also be used.
For someone who wants to relieve his arm and facilitate blood flow in the second vein during surgery when the evacuation is excessive and its strength is weak, it is necessary for one who performs the surgery to make the blood flow little by little according to its strength over several days.
For one who wants to relax his arm and facilitate blood flow in the second vein during surgery, and he has a strong body, it should be done within seven hours or ten minutes of the first operation. And for someone who intends to draw blood from the body towards the side it is directed to, it is necessary for him to rest on the second or third day.
If there is much blood in the body, it may clot and bring on a fever. It is necessary to draw out all the blood at once from him, and to draw out as much as possible. The incision should be enlarged until the pus is exposed after all conditions for lancing have been met. Place your hand on the pulse when bleeding occurs to prevent death at the site of the wound, as this often happens if the lancing is done carelessly and with haste. It is not advisable to let the blood flow again after the fracture has been treated.
When the pharynx has closed and blood flow has stopped, it is not advisable to lance it with force or to press on it strongly as this is very painful. Either leave it until you can lance it again or, alternatively, make a small incision with a knife blade to let out some blood from the pharynx.
Or you can hold it with something from salt dissolved in water or with a piece of farrukh or shakhnaya and lance it gently until the blood flows out, but if the pharynx has become swollen, leave it.
Do not touch it until the worm has settled, for if necessity requires the blood to be let out again, you can either lance it in that spot or in another fracture or in another pharynx.
As for drawing the thread of the ulna (forearm bone), draw it with a hot probe made from alkali and beeswax, if they are not available or are hidden, as it is a mixture of both; and the method of doing so is to let the assistant insert his hand into hot water until the tendon turns red and the vein appears clearly, then press gently on it with the probe moderately.
Then, draw the vein slightly on a small angle without exposure or length, and ensure the opening is wide, so that your draw will be above the wrist joint a little; if there is difficulty in withdrawing blood, place the hand again in hot water with the blood flowing in the water.
Until your need is met, if you are in summer days, you will prefer not to put the hand again in hot water and what makes blood flow more easily in hot water during winter, draw this vein gently from all veins. Because there is no artery or nerve beneath it, and as for drawing the saphenous vein from the left hand, it is beneficial for the liver; and the method of doing so is to press firmly with a probe or your hand after inserting it into hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no artery or nerve beneath it, and as for drawing the saphenous vein from the left hand, it is beneficial for the liver; and the method of doing so is to press firmly with a probe or your hand after inserting it into hot water until the vein swells. The hard lump should be clearly distinguished, then it should be gently dissected and divided if it is attached to the whole [tissue]. This will not harm it in any way. Keep your hand from pressing on the area as the muscles underneath are visible; then return your hand to the hot water.
Let it bleed, then if you do not place it in hot water, the blood will coagulate in its cavity and prevent the flow. If blood is removed as required, apply oil and salt to the wound so that it does not clot quickly.
Similarly, it is necessary to perform on every tight vein. It is beneficial to remove the right hand as it helps in curing piles, and similarly, perform it the same way on the left. As for removing a hernia, it is beneficial for treating diseases below the stomach such as piles.
Touch the pus and kidney diseases, ulcers of the fingers and toes, and other similar ailments; and how to remove them, the man should immerse his hand in hot water and hold it with pliers until he feels the tendons. Then press strongly on the area where the man's leg is separated by the anus, and the wound should be placed at the opening of the anus.
From it, on the face of the man, a large number of hairs grow. Cut them in a wider area or near the navel where there is a gathering (of hairs), as this is best and more hygienic. If you cut it on the face of the man, save the limbs underneath the face of the man.
Make your incision as if you were to peel off the skin, and let it become a flap. If bleeding occurs, have him dip his foot in hot water and leave the blood to run out until it stops. If you accidentally cut the nerve during the first incision, correct it immediately.
Dip a little deeper during the incision as the place is safe, and it should not cause harm to others if you save the nerve as we have said, and do the same for any other vein of the man, and regarding the female's nerve, its location is as we have said at the side of the crotch.
It is beneficial to cut it for the pain of the ulna if it is caused by hot blood, and the method of cutting it is for the assistant to enter the cavity from the wrist and rush quickly and push his finger from the wrist towards above the navel with four fingers using a thin, long probe, as it does not show otherwise.
If it appears (the ulcer), capture it in any condition; either leave it alone on the crust, which is best, or break it with a lancet or cut it off, its location is safe. It usually is concealed greatly among people, so if you do not find it.
If the boil does not appear to touch, capture a part of it which appears on the surface of the foot near the heel and the toe and keep it from infections and send the required amount of blood.
Then dissolve the plaster and place it on the captured location, close the location as it will quickly heal.
The sixth and fortieth section.
On incisions and methods of their application.
Incisions can be made of flesh, wood, copper, and glass. An incision with a guarantee (of healing) is an incision that allows for blood to be drawn out, and the other type of incision is without a guarantee.
This incision without a guarantee has two types.
Incisions of the palms, they are two pages from the necks on both sides, and incisions of the throat which is beneath the lower jaw from the mouth, and incisions of the armpits, and incisions of the buttocks at the elbow joint, and incisions of the shins, and incisions of the heels.
The extraction of blood from the swollen veins in the flesh is what draws out the phlegm, and for this reason, it should not be done so that strength does not leave or the fracture does not fall apart. It is not permissible to use incision with or without fire in one of the diseases caused by phlegm until the body has completely discharged.
If the need for incision arises either from a disease or as custom, we use it at any time during the beginning, middle, or end of the month.
That is because among people there are those whose blood accumulates so much that it requires extraction by incision, and they find a heavy head and congestion in it, and among them there are those who find phlegm and redness on their face and head and neck, and among them there are those who have ulcers on their face and defects and blindness in their eyes, and among them are those who shake the location of their incision.
Among them is one who laughs a lot, among them is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth and bites himself and the blood flows abundantly, among them is one who sleeps a lot and sees in his sleep blood and redness and killings and surgeries resembling that, so when have we seen such a thing.
Specifically, it has been our practice at that time, in the middle third of the month, to perform cupping after two or three hours have passed from midday. As for the benefit of cupping bloodletting, it is beneficial for alleviating headache and water retention near the eyes.
But it should be done after the abdomen has been evacuated, and this cupping may help in relieving congestion of the head. However, it is cautioned that it should not be used when the head is cold or there is a fever present, as it will harm him greatly.
For this reason, it is not appropriate for elders to use it when they have cold head ailments, and those who are prone to forgetfulness should avoid it.
Therefore, the cupping practitioner should lower his hand slightly towards the patient during cupping, fearing that forgetfulness may occur, and as for cupping of the forehead, it is beneficial in relieving congestion of the forehead and nose.
Therefore, it is beneficial to use cautery and tightening of the veins, respirator apparatus, stimulation and inflation, and it is important that the abdominal incision be slightly raised because if it sinks and becomes weak in the heart and the diaphragm.
As for the incisions made in the skull, they are beneficial for treating injuries on the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin, as well as jaw fractures. It is important that the incisions be carefully made so as not to cut nerves, which may cause bleeding.
As for incisions beneath the neck, they are beneficial for treating swellings in the mouth and diseases of the throat and similar areas. Regarding incisions on the shoulders, they are useful for treating burns that may be due to overheating.
As for incisions on the abdomen of venous system, it is beneficial to drain the three main veins, the vena cava, hepatic vein and the inferior vena cava because it draws blood from all the contracted veins in the muscle tissue and it draws the contracted veins from a more prominent vein until it reaches the three large veins.
It is required that the one who cuts (incises) must not miss the mark because the location is evident of flesh and vessels and nerves beneath it, but as for the one who incises on a nerve, it benefits from its branches and sprouts at its lower part.
It is required that the one who incises (cuts) should make it large and should be made of copper because the location needs a strong suture and there is a risk that the incision may break the glass, and as for the incisions of vessels, they reduce the filling by a certain degree.
Because it attracts blood from all over the body and benefits from the abscesses located in the kidneys, urinary bladder, stomach, spleen, intestines, and bowels, and it relieves pain and benefits from blisters, boils, swellings, and it is used to treat fistulas and ulcers except that it injures the body greatly and causes swelling in most people, and the incisions of abscesses are beneficial close to the benefit of the incisions of vessels.
The method of placing the incisions is to place the incision first empty, then suture it with a moderate thread and do not make it too long. Place the incisions quickly and remove them quickly so that the mixture can be accepted into the location uniformly and not remain swollen. Repeat this until you see the location turn red and open up.
If blood appears red, then you should cauterize and keep repeating the cauterization until examining the organs. If it is a human, cut off the meat piece by piece while being careful not to miss any part, as it can cause complications.
The cauterizer is ordered to widen the cauterization slightly and move it gently along the wound, for if there is thick blood, it should be cauterized twice: in the first instance, he should open a way for the thinning of the blood and its flow, and in the second instance, not extract the thick blood.
If the blood is very thick, the cauterization should be repeated a third time to achieve the goal, and in general, if we want to extract a small amount of blood, a single cauterization is sufficient for us, but if we wish to extract a large amount of blood, the cauterization must be repeated more times, and it is possible to make the blood thick.
It is necessary to make a deep cauterization, with the tip of the cautery reaching only the skin, not using any ointments or water, and not allowing the cauterized person to touch it, if his skin is thick, hard, and the wound is tight.
It is necessary to anoint the sites of incisions with open, fragrant ointments such as aloes, benzoin, sweet-smelling almond oil or honey, or poppy seed oil if it's during summertime.
If it is in winter, it should be similar to the anointing of musk or saffron or camphor or ambergris, and such. If the coldness is severe, the oil used for anointing should be warm oil like almond oil, olive oil, castor oil or oil of benzoin, and such.
If the wound is deep and cuts deeply into the flesh, it is necessary to abstain from anointing it. Those who do not abstain should wash their wounds after being sutured with warm water or cold water or water of fig leaves or honey water or lupine water, and such. As for those whose blood flows excessively.
Wash the wounds with salt water or goat's milk and such, and as for those whose flesh is hard, wash the wounds with strong alcohol or honey water or lupine water or oil of benzoin, and such. It is necessary to avoid suturing in a bath and after leaving the bath.
It is advisable to wait after leaving the bath for an hour or two, and no one should sleep after suturing. The stitched person should not be spoken to before or after suturing.
If the person who is being operated on or the assistant is pale and there is excessive bleeding and inflammation, it is necessary to take warm things such as hot irons (cauterizing instruments), linen cloths, and similar items. Prepare foods such as ferrets and hare meat, and serve them with sheep's trotters and similar dishes.
If the patient is cold, it is necessary to give him honey water or mebeb (a type of wine made from barley) or warm skunk-fat and he should eat moderate food. The food for him should be ferrets, quails, goldfinches, and young pigeons from the bathhouse. It is advisable that the drink on the day of suturing and cauterization be more than the food.
In some cases, people may be given the drug for excitement or musk oil or silphium before suturing and cauterization, or before or after it to strengthen the main parts and stimulate the blood flow. It is not advisable to give the patient alcohol.
Regarding incisions without condition, these are incisions made on the abdomen, flanks, breastplate, stomach, liver, kidneys, and small of the back. This is because these parts do not accept conditions; rather, they aim to draw blood from one part to another.
"We make incisions on the breasts for relief or to draw out cold air from the part as there may be pain in the body. We also make incisions on the stomach and the intestines because they loosen and heat up the affected part, expelling the wind.
"An incision is made on the kidney if there is a stone or gravel in it, and with strong suction, we may open the stone or remove it from its place. Similarly, an incision is made on the liver and spleen when gas accumulates in them, and these incisions are typically empty of any medicine.
"An incision can be made with fire, and it can also be filled with boiling water for the treatment of fistulas. This is done by filling the incision with hot water or boiling water to which certain healing herbs have been added.
Then a ligature is placed on the spot and held, and it is tightened repeatedly as required; this is the image of the ligated one using fire.
A hollow tube with two open ends should be made as shown, and its length should be about half a finger deep, and on its side, in about half of it, there should be a small hole that fits the diameter of the wire, which is made from Chinese copper or yellow brass, thickly grooved.
A flat-faced clyster (syringe) with a resistant probe in the middle made from copper or iron, where the emollient is placed when heated. This ligature can be large as described earlier or small depending on the condition of the illness.
The use of a clyster (syringe) is different for boys and women, and as for the method of heating this ligature with fire on the limb, it is to heat a thin or small wire from cane or emollient made of clay and place it in the middle of the hollow probe that is inside the ligature.
The fire should be raised to just below the ligature so as not to burn the surrounding tissue, then it is placed on the limb and probe on the hole we mentioned until we secure the ligature, at which point we remove the probe.
The purgative was applied to the wound, and the plaster adhered to the site. Then, the cautery was applied to the lesion, returning it if necessary. As for the plaster used in scabies treated with water, it should not contain a probe or hole.
It is only to be filled with water and placed on the limb, and its form is as shown below.
This plaster, whenever it was large enough to hold about six liters of water, was found to be better.
The seventh and ninety-seventh section.
On the ligation of the artery.
The ligature is mainly used in the limbs where plasters cannot be placed either due to their small size, such as veins and arteries, or because the limb is exposed to meat, such as fingers and nose etc.
The method of using it is to take a ligature from the water containing salt solutions and leave it in the salty water for a day or night until it swells and nothing remains inside it. Then, the body is drained either by cupping or bleeding, and then the affected limb is cleaned.
until it turns red, then place [it] on it. If it coagulates and falls off, and if the place can be cauterized with iron, it is more beneficial; otherwise, wash the place with lime, then with much water and soap, grind [it]. If bleeding persists after the clot falls off, let a chestnut bark be crushed in cold water.
place it on top until the bleeding stops, if there is much blood, let a poultice of powdered oaks bark or similar from willow trees be applied to stop the bleeding or a linen cloth soaked in vinegar can be put on the wound.
leave it to adhere to the wound until the bleeding stops, and if there is a need for reapplication of the clot, do not apply that clot if another can be avoided, for if the clot is prevented from adhering, wash the wound with donkey's blood.
or tie a thread in the wound until something from the blood comes out, then put it [the thread] down. If it feels something from the blood has adhered to it, let it remain at that spot if you want to keep it, but if you wish for it to fall off, sprinkle something from ashes, salt or lime on it; it will fall off onto the spot.
Chapter Three.
On Algebra.
This chapter also pertains to what is essential for the practice of medicine, namely algebra of fractures and dislocations in bones.
Be informed, O children, that this chapter may be scorned by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and those who have not delved into the books of the ancient sages even a single letter.
And for this purpose, this art has become extinct in our land, and I have not found in it any good application. I have only benefited from it due to my long reading of ancient books and my diligence in understanding them until I extracted that knowledge from them, then I was compelled by experience and practice throughout my life.
And I have explained to you in this chapter everything that my learning encompasses on the subject. I have continued my practice after presenting it to you, and I have simplified and shortened it as much as possible while making it clear and providing many illustrations of the machines used in it.
And as for the additional explanation, which you did in the preceding chapters, may there be no power except God, the Most High.
Chapter One.
In the first chapter, we will gather and compile everything regarding the fracture of bones and their setting. Before we start with the descriptions of broken and dislocated limbs one by one, it is necessary in this topic to explain some general rules and principles. You are first required to understand and comply with the truth of this subject, for those who are eager to learn this noble art, it is not for you.
When any fracture, dislocation, wound or falling occurs, it is essential to hasten towards the setting or reduction of the injury, or both, immediately. There is no obstacle to this, except for factors such as weakness of strength or the person who experienced the injury being a child or an old man, in cold or extremely hot weather.
Then, his diet should consist only of cold food, poultry and fish, and avoid alcohol and heavy meats, avoid overeating or consuming any food that fills the veins with blood until the danger of infection is past and no inflammation is expected to occur at the site.
When the cause is identified, it should be treated according to its first manifestation, if the broken bone is in a joint, then the patient should be fed with heavy foods that are nourishing and contain ingredients such as rice, barley, wheat, peas and beef marrow. The egg, the mutton marrow, thick drinks and similar things are swiftest and best for fractures in management. Know that bones broken in men with excessive drinking and old age cannot be restored to their original nature permanently.
Due to their softness and fragility, bones broken in young children cannot be restored completely as nature forms on the fractured bone from all sides a kind of scar tissue which strengthens but does not regain its original hardness.
Until it regains its strength and hardness like before, so that nothing weakens it in the future.
Therefore, it is necessary to make the patient's diet rich in nutrients, proteins and fats as mentioned earlier, and know that fractures vary according to the differences of bones, for a fracture of a toe bone differs from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the chest differs from a fracture of the back.
Similarly, all the bones differ from each other in their types of fractures and we will discuss each type of fracture separately, and the type of bone fracture may also vary within itself.
It may be a fracture caused without the presence of bone splinters, or it may be a fracture along the length of the bone and there may be bone splinters and loose fragments as well as non-loose ones. The fracture may be simple or compound and occur in the skin and the fracture may be a clean one or oblique.
For each type of fracture, there is a specific method in treating it as will be detailed in its place, and what is known as bone fracture is characterized by swelling, deformity, and the appearance of pain upon pressure applied to it with your hand.
When there is no visible swelling, no tenderness or pain upon examination of the bone, and the cause is not apparent, it may not be a fracture but rather a contusion or a simple or compound fracture here or an oblique one. In such cases, it should not be moved or subjected to repeated palpation.
But apply the medicines that will be described later when the situation is appropriate, then press gently but firmly, and know that if a bone fractures and displaces without splinters appearing in it, it means that each part has separated from its owner.
It is necessary for you to go to his bed and make it clean before a hot fever occurs, if a hot fever happens then leave him for some days until the fever cools down. Then adjust it with any means you can manage from cooling and sweating.
Know that dislocation and setting is easier than a bone that has fractured, then it becomes more difficult when the fracture will occur, so if the bone is fractured, there is no choice but to wait for the swelling to subside from both sides, whether it is an arm or a leg.
If the limb is small, use your hands; if it is a rope or with a rope and hand, then position the limb in its natural place until the broken bone extends. Then align those additional pieces in their places using any means you can manage with cooling and sweating.
Exert your effort to avoid causing pain, suffering or fever with your actions, and strive to firmly hold one of the bones together with its partner in the best possible position. At that time, it is necessary to touch and feel them with your hand if you see something abnormal, then adjust and set it as much as your ability allows.
Beware of the severe blow and the powerful thrust, as many ignorant ones often cause it, and it happens frequently due to their actions, causing a sudden burning or long duration in a limb, as you have likely observed this from their actions repeatedly.
Then, after the setting and confirmation, apply pressure to that swollen limb and drainage, and warn against moving it during its awakening or sleeping state, during its conversion (fever) and seizures, during its breaking out, and all of its movements, which are extensive and intense, and ensure that the wound accompanies it.
That is, when the limb is bandaged with a wound or pain, do not transfer it to another location where it does not feel pain along with it and beware that its position during this time remains level.
To avoid causing convulsions in the limb, and as for the way to press a broken limb, I will explain it to you. Know that broken limbs vary in their smallness and largeness and shape; for example, some are small like fingers, toes, and bones, and others are larger such as the arm or leg.
It is necessary for the splints for fractures to be firm and not wide, as a wide bandage will require a large limb and press it uniformly from all sides, leaving no gaps.
Then, after the interval in the setting (of the fracture), you begin to apply the plaster that suits it (the fracture). In case of a soft tissue swelling on the site of fracture, then begin to wrap (the limb) at the site of fracture with three or four layers according to what suits the limb, and press slightly with the bandage, then take it to the upper side of the fracture location.
Press slightly less than your pressure on the fractured site, then retreat from the site of fracture a little and release the pressure a little at a time until you take something suitable for the fracture location, then take another stick and wrap it around the fractured site.
Wrap, then take the bandage to the lower side of the fracture and perform the same pressure and tension as described in the first layer (upper layer), then place between the swelling or bruising layers an amount equal to the displacement of the fracture.
If there are swellings, do not make anything in it, then wrap another stick, then adjust these thin and precise layers of bandages according to your time, if there is no gas or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is pus or a hot abscess in it, hold over it what cures the abscess and let it remain until it subsides, then apply pressure with the forceps when it becomes soft. The forceps should be made from half of a nutmeg shell, well-rounded and polished, or they can be made of fine wood of the grater.
The forceps should be made from nutmeg shells, or the wood of the grater, or bones, and they should be shaped like what is depicted here and in this form.
The forceps placed on the fracture should be slightly concave and different from other forceps, and as for the length of the forceps, it is made according to the size of the affected limb, both large and small. The shape of the forceps:.
Then apply another pressure on the forceps according to the first one's pressure, then tie above it with strong threads, according to what we mentioned about the pressure, which is that the pressure should be more at the fracture site. And wherever there was a distance from the fracture, the pressure was less.
The threads should be medium in thickness and soft, specifically made of damp cotton, as threads that are rough like what is shown by the ignorant, who make their threads from unbleached cotton strips, is a grave mistake.
The fracture occurs outside the limits and even the thread stitches do not help, as you will not reach what is desired with it. It should not be between the joints.
If the fracture occurs near the joints after setting in the correct positions, make it soft padding or loose cotton underneath to prevent any harm from that. As for when the break is accompanied by a wound and a tear in the skin, we will discuss it separately.
Know that not every fractured bone needs to be set with the joints from the first day, and this is because if the bone is large, it should not be set with the joints except after five or seven days or more, depending on your certainty of avoiding a severe infection.
These are the properties of splints that were compulsory for the early ages to put on fractures, dislocations, and sprains. A general splint property presses the fracture and is suitable for more patients and especially not young children or women because it can neither withstand heat nor cold.
Take from the millstone dust, which is the door of fine flour that adheres to the millstone near the movement of the mill, grind it as you would with anything else except sifting it with egg whites and making it neither lumpy nor powdery, then knead it.
The final mixture to be crushed, ground, sifted and mixed should consist of wheat, barley, sesame, poppy seeds, linseed, mustard and salt from each ten dirhams, with the patience and cost of each being five dirhams, with forty dirhams for the oil and twenty dirhams for Armenian clay or Roman clay. Grind all of the ingredients together and mix with olive oil or egg whites if the mixture is loose, then use this paste as it is good for quick healing of broken bones and beneficial to most people.
The final mixture also benefits for cracking and splitting, take sesame, wheat, and white chalk from each ten dirhams, the patience and cost of each being five dirhams, poppy seeds six dirhams, Armenian clay twenty dirhams. Grind all of the ingredients finely, sift and knead with water or egg whites and use it.
bandage for the joints and loose bones that have moved from their places, it accommodates the wound and there is no bone concussion or fracture, take soft cotton and rub it in oil and heated olive oil, then place it on the site, this bandage does not have strength in pressure.
and it is weak in treating hot wounds and draining them, this is another type of bandage that presses the broken bone, take thin paper from walnut leaves and fine silk, grind them together and apply a moist mixture of them, this is another short type of bandage used during setting of broken bones.
you wish to treat the remnant of a wound, take from a plant called khutsmeh and babunj, as well as fine sandalwood and mustard powder from each part, grind all together and apply a paste of it if the limb is not broken, but if it is broken, use water or milk instead.
this is another stronger type of bandage used when a hard wound occurs during setting of bones, take from khutsmeh plant, hazelnut shells, almond, camphor and mastic gum, as well as fine sandalwood and babunj from each part.
He (the patient) should be anesthetized and the wound should be cauterized either with hot iron, or with boiling water, or with caustic substances. Each of these methods is applied according to the heat of the member and its state of being hot. As for bone fractures, he did not mention in his book that it should be set while applying pressure.
The ointment made from fat and oil should be moderate between being too soft or too hard. As for the Gallenus (Galen), he thinks that something soft with a little heat such as pitch, tar, lime, or similar substances should be placed on the fractured bone while it is being set.
A salve is beneficial for wounds and sores. It is prepared from honey, flour, human hair (or feathers of a bird or camel), and powdered chalk, whether it is to cauterize, cure, anesthetize, or bind. As for the amount that should remain as a bandage.
Then, if no complications occur and there is neither pain nor movement in the fractured bone from its place, it should not be treated for many days. If a complication occurs in its place such as severe pain or severe swelling or air entering, it should be treated.
Apply heat to the affected part immediately and do not delay this procedure, then remove the pus. Take a clean linen or cotton swab that has been soaked in warm water and gently clean the area until the inflammation subsides and the wound settles. Then leave the limb to rest for an hour.
Then, place the soft bandage soaked in oil or fat of the olive on it and bind it overnight until the acute pain subsides and the swelling settles, then return to light pressure and gentle bandaging, but do not apply excessive pressure at first.
Keep applying the heat until it starts to heal. If you see that pain, redness, swelling, inflammation, and all other symptoms have completely disappeared and you need to return to bandaging and pressure, do so as you did initially. If nothing happens in the limb, do not worry.
Do not cut it open before three, four, five or seven days have passed. It may last up to twenty days depending on the state of the limb as we previously mentioned, until it breaks and the flesh around it starts to decay.
Also, when the fracture has become harder than your initial fracture, make an additional incision in it and in opening the fractured bone, if you find that the break has loosened more than what is expected, then know that food should be withheld from it.
Swab with warm water at every dressing and this should be done daily for three days and slightly reduce the swelling, as doing so will facilitate the flow of food to the limb and it will heal quickly. As for those who incorrectly break a bone again.
If a fracture has not been set correctly initially and then it is set at an angle, this is a mistake on their part and a grave one. Even if such initial treatment was correct according to their books, and the person did it and you do not see any effect of this in anyone from them, there would be no benefit in it. It is correct that nothing should be done with it.
The Second Chapter.
On Compound Fractures of the Skull.
There are various types and shapes of compound fractures in the skull, and their causes can be numerous. One type is caused by a sword strike which breaks all the bones to end at the sutures beneath the skull. As a craftsman performs on wood.
And thus, this type of fracture is named 'qudumia' or 'saw cut', and it may be a sawing of bone and cartilage only in part without cutting through to the other side, and it is called this type of fracture 'complete fracture' in general. These two types of fractures can be either large or small.
And among the fractures, there are those which are crushing or splitting and their cause is a blow with a stone or falling on a stone or similar, and this type of fracture can be either an opening one that penetrates the covering beneath the bone or it can be in the surface of the bone.
These two types of fractures can also be either large or small, and among the fractures there is one that is hidden within the bone in a layer of hair and it is an easy fissure.
And thus, this type of fracture is named 'hair-fracture', and it is a fracture resulting from dropping or striking a stone which enters a layer of the bone and remains in place, similar to an abscess as it is exposed to the effect of mercury if it is struck with a blow, a portion of it will enter inside.
That which is most likely to be in the moist bone of the skull are cracks similar to those of a eggshell, and such fractures can be either free or non-free. We shall discuss their treatment in detail in their respective places, and we shall recognize all types of fractures by examination.
Examine them with probes and remove the rotten flesh from them, and as for the hairy type, it is recognized by the bone showing through, rubbing it and pressing on it with a probe; in such cases, the fracture appears black. As for treatment of fractures, first observe their symptoms.
If you see any symptoms that indicate fear such as convulsions, spreading, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, blindness or clouding, severe pain and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient and do not treat him; in most cases, death occurs with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not cause alarm and seem safe, then approach him for treatment; this is because if the wounded person comes to you in the first instance, and he was injured in cold weather.
It is necessary to strive for the removal of bone before the tenth day in all cases, and if it is during summer days, it is necessary to hurry in removing the bone before the seventh day, so as not to spoil what is under the bone, making those symptoms appear which we have described.
If the bone is broken and has reached the membrane covering the skull and accompanied by swelling and redness, it is necessary to cut the affected part as I have described to you, which is to saw off the head of the hammer-shaped (bone fragment).
When exposing the bone on any side that allows you, depending on the nature of the injury and what is suspected on the hammer-shaped (bone fragment), if bleeding or hot pus appears upon exposure to the bone, take measures accordingly.
It is to fill the site with a paste made of crushed garlic, vinegar, oil and salt until the pus settles and the bleeding stops, then to set the bone and remove it. This should be done in one or either of two ways.
As for one way, it is to cut the bone with a sharp, fine-bladed saw. Here is its form:.
Then use a piece of it afterwards, and this is its image:. (The image is omitted here since I am a text-based AI.)
Then use another piece after that as well, and it is necessary for you to have several pieces of different sizes, some of which are used instead of others and some are shorter than others, and at the tip they should be made of Indian steel or good iron.
Use the rasp to strike on the bone so that it does not splinter and injure the head, for if the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary to drill around it before using the pieces with the flat chisels that are called non-scraping chisels, and not scraping chisels.
Because it does not exceed the bone of the skull to what is beyond it, so that the drill has a narrow groove on its tip similar to a flat or small circular shape that prevents it from cracking and piercing the bone.
It is necessary for you to take a number of these chisels, each suitable for the size of that bone crack until you prepare for each skull a chisel of the appropriate length and shortness according to the size of that skull crack. Here are three types of images:. (The image captions/numbers are omitted here since I am a text-based AI.) On large, medium and small fractures:
As for the method of incising the bone that is fractured, it is to make an incision on the bone and move it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been driven through, then move the incision to another place, and make a gap between each incision equal to the width of the marrow or something similar.
Then cut between the two incisions and do so with the aim that you can align it as we said until the bone is split, either by your hand or by something else from one of the tools you have prepared for this purpose.
Like the saw and the small chisel, it is necessary to avoid touching the incision or the cut with anything from a scalpel, for if the bone curls up and the scalpel adheres to it and you remove it, it is necessary to clean it.
You smooth out the roughness that remains in the bone with another tool resembling a chisel, but it is necessary that it be sharper and finer than other chisels, for if there remains something of small bones and splinters, you take them with a plier using what you have of tools.
Then, the wound is treated after that with cautery and leeches, as for the other aspect of the operation, it is an easy approach far from risk, which Galen described and praised greatly. This is his saying. First, you must start by excavating the bone fragment from the location where the fracture occurred, the hardest and most prominent part until you expose that bone fragment. Below it, you will find this crescent shape, which is its image:
The crescent-shaped bone fragment should be soft and not divided, while the sharp edge of it is on its smooth sides in length as you can see. The crescent-shaped bone is similar to a falcon's beak, and the sharp edge of the bone is in the bone itself. Then, strike the bone from one side.
Use a small hammer until you cut all the bone gently, as if it were rotating, and you are safe from being deceived as no harmful injury occurs during the operation, even if the operator is unskilled or clumsy.
If there remains something of the bone from the incision in some locations of the bone, remove it with the same crescent-shaped edge and free it gently, for it will free itself without injury or fear.
If the bone is fractured and does not penetrate the skin, but the part that has been cut from the bone remains with pus and maggots in it, it is necessary to drain the pus and crush the maggots using a suitable tool. You may take different quantities of various tools according to each situation and improve it based on what guides you towards it.
The fractured bone and its shape, it is necessary to first apply the tool for draining the bone, then use a finer one after that and not stop doing so until you reach using the finest tool to scrape and crush all of it.
As for the small scalp wounds and delicate fractures, it is necessary to treat each one according to what leads to its healing, and this is not hidden from anyone who has knowledge of this craft. The lowest tool and stopping at what we have written and clarified in major fractures.
If the wound remains open after draining the bone, it is necessary to take a probe according to the injury and immerse it in oil or fat and place it on the wound of the injury, then take another similar or three-pronged probe. Apply it [the suture] in wine, then let it soak and place it on the first layer. Make this as thin as you can manage, so that the needle does not become too heavy. Then use it from above the wide bindings, but do not tighten except to stop the wound.
Keep it in this treatment for a day or two until the hot inflammation is gone, then dissolve it and use the medicine that contains the benefit of roots such as cinnamon, ginger, camphor, and similar ones. Make this medicine by mixing these herbs.
Keep it pressed on the wound until it is dry, and for this use a medicine that is meant to heal without irritating. Apply your effort in treating the wound that it should be clean, there should not be any pus or swelling, and do not leave the scab where the maggot gathers.
Because the maggot, if it gathers on the skull cover, will rot and soften it, causing a great blight, and it may appear in the head of the needle when the bone is exposed, especially if you neglect its treatment.
Lesions on the surface of the eye: if symptoms such as those we mentioned occur, know that it is incurable. However, if the lesion only happens due to a medicine applied and there was strength in that medicine to cause the lesion, then it can be cured.
It is necessary to take parts from honey and the tallow of the calf, grind them well, mix them with a pestle, then apply it to a linen cloth and treat it with various treatments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Cauterization of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose does not break except when it is broken completely or partially because what is below it is cartilage, which does not break, but only bends and deforms.
If one of the nasal bones is broken, it is necessary to insert your little fingers into the nostril and straighten the break from within using your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape. This should be done carefully to avoid causing further pain or damage.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not touch the finger, it should be treated by pressing with a blunt probe slightly curved at the end. If the fracture is on both sides, do as mentioned above and attempt to reduce it on the first day after the fracture.
If there is inflammation after seven or ten days, a probe made of splinters from the cedar tree should be inserted into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or two probes if it is on both sides.
Make the probe smooth enough to fit inside the nostril, and some of the early practitioners have mentioned that oil should be applied to it daily. However, I find it more appropriate that the probe is rubbed with white egg yolk mixed with ashes from a millstone.
Leave the probe in place until the bone heals and the fracture is stabilized. Then, insert a tube made from the reed of an eel into the nostril after it has been treated with a mixture of beeswax to make its hold on the nose stronger and prevent the patient from breathing through the nose during recovery.
This is not necessary if you wish to make the probe yourself or use other materials. However, if your nose becomes inflamed and swollen during treatment, you can apply a poultice made of mustard seeds, flaxseed soaked in honey and oil, or some herbs known for their medicinal properties.
If a boil does not become hot, it should be lanced from outside with fine mustard and ginger ground into powder (white of) eggshell, then apply soft dough on top without tying the nose with anything made of cotton, for if the bones of the nose are broken, they will break in small pieces.
If it breaks, it should be sutured and extracted with the appropriate tool, then the wound is stitched and treated with what heals and alleviates pain, according to that, if an injury occurs within the nose, it should be treated with a probe and copper tubes used. Until it heals.
The fourth section.
If the lower jaw is broken, apply a splint.
If the lower jaw is broken and not accompanied by injury to the face, if it is broken only from outside without being pushed inwards, then recognizing its location will be easier.
If the break is in the right cheek, insert a splint from the left hand into the mouth of the patient, and similarly if the break is in the left cheek, insert a splint from the right hand and raise the broken piece out from inside to outside.
Another piece of bone from outside must be ruled by it, its fracture shall be set with the malleus from both sides until it can be set, if it has happened in the teeth, they will spread apart.
The other piece of bone, ruled by it, should be held with gold or silver wire, and then placed on the fractured phalanx, then a large, firm splint or a thick piece of hide equal in length to the phalanx is placed on top of it. Then, it is tied from above according to what seems appropriate for you to tie it and hold it tightly so that it does not move. The patient should be instructed to rest and remain still and feed him with soft food. If you suspect something has changed in its shape from any of the sides, then treat it on the third day.
Then, it is tied from above according to what seems appropriate for you to tie it and hold it tightly so that it does not move. The patient should be instructed to rest and remain still and feed him with soft food. If you suspect something has changed in its shape from any of the sides, then treat it on the third day. Treat what is being held with pigeon dung mixed with white lime or fine flour after removing the splint from it and place soft poultice over it. If that poultice does not stick to the bone, leave it as it is.
Do not incise it until it abscesses and the fracture breaks extensively, for this fracture often takes three weeks to break. If exposed during that period, apply as we have previously described to alleviate the pain until the abscess subsides.
If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, and it has already abscessed from the bone with shards or shards of bone, be gentle when removing these shards using whatever instrument suits you. If there is tightness in the wound, widen it slightly with your finger to the extent required.
Then, if you have removed all the shards and there is nothing left, suture the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the bandages suitable for that purpose. Massage the wound until it abscesses.
The Fifth Chapter.
In the case of a fracture, apply traction.
A fracture of the tibia is more likely to split along one of three planes: either it splits and collapses without any shards, or shards are produced which makes traction easier.
If shards occur in the fracture, traction is more difficult and if the fracture occurs without a wound, prepare assistants to stabilize one of them who will apply traction to the fractured limb while the other pulls his neck towards the opposite side.
Then, set the fracture right with your fingers until its shape is as required and there is no protrusion or sinking, if it requires more time, a piece of splint made from wood or cotton should be placed under the affected limb.
Place the bone as required and press gently on the ball of your hand until the fracture is set in its correct position, if you cannot make the edge of the bone protrude from outside due to it being deeply embedded, then a splint should be applied to the affected limb.
Place a medium-sized splint under the fracture and have the assistant press down on it until the bone rises above, then the fracture is healed and set with your fingers.
If you feel that a piece of bone from the limb has broken and is moving, it is necessary to immobilize it and extract the broken piece with one of the instruments prepared for this purpose. After the instrument used to maintain traction is placed under the limb, it is an apparatus made of wood or metal, and here is its appearance:.
The vessel resembles a basin, but it should not have a drill hole. Its width should be according to the size of the bone and its smallness, and as for its length, it should also be according to what you can manage and it should be double-edged, just like one side is wider and the other is narrower.
If the wound, which you have cut during extraction of a bone fragment and is wide and discharging pus, gather together the eyes of the wound with stitching, and if the wound is soft or fear the hot pus, then cauterize the wound with a needle and benefit from it to the extent that the wound has been cauterized.
If the pus is hot, burn the wound with oil or vinegar and carry it [on], and if the bone is hard but not injured or broken, then lay a plaster taken from oven ash mixed with white of egg on it. Place a smooth paste [on it], then place the ball beneath its ligament if necessary, then take a long probe that is narrow or of similar size, then apply gentle traction to the paste and plaster, then hold a sharp hook on the probe. Its length should be three fingers and its position the same. Then insert it in the wound, then place that incision together with the probe at the site of the fracture. Then tighten the probe on the fracture as one turns it. Place it around the patient's neck and under the healthy ligament, and under the sick person's ligament. Insert it multiple times on each side, as you see fit. Tighten it firmly to securely bind the fracture, which is not hidden from you.
Ensure that the probe does not slip off the broken bone. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the ligature daily. Whenever you find that the probe has slipped off and needs adjustment, correct it and tighten the ligature. Then make the patient lie on his back, and place a small pad under his ligament during sleep at night.
The arm should be raised with it so that the fracture rises along with the shoulder, or the arm should be tied to the neck. The ligature must not slip unless an accident or illness occurs within ten days.
Then, replace the splint if you find that it has worn out for this purpose. In case of a fracture, leave it to heal until it becomes swollen and thickened, and it strengthens more in about twenty-eight days. In some people, it may heal in less than that.
Sixth Section.
In a dislocation of the shoulder, it is not the shoulder joint itself that breaks, but rather its letters [bones]. How to recognize this is by touch, for the shape of the fracture indicates it.
Straighten and set the fracture back to its natural shape in all directions you can, then apply a mixture of plaster of Paris, egg white, and soft clay on top of it. Cover this with a flat board made from a single piece of wood.
Keep the shoulder area as flexible as possible, or slightly more than that if necessary. If there is a hollow under the bandage in one of the areas of the shoulder, fill it with soft clay until the bandage lies flat, then bind over it with a long strip of cloth.
Hold the bandage tightly and secure it so that it does not slip from its place, and check the bandaging every day. If the bandage loosens, tighten and realign the bandage if it slips off its place. The pain on the affected side should be mild, and the shoulder will swell in ten days.
"On certain days, or fifty-two days have passed, if this number is completed, then loosen the bandage and you are safe; for it is one of the bones that there is no fear of fracturing nor displacing. If a sharpness comes from the bone and it is found beneath the skin, break it open and remove it. "Make the procedure as described for breaking the tarso-metatarsal bone to relieve a hot wound if something of that nature occurs.
"Seventh section
"Injury: Breaking the chest.
"The chest may break in the middle slightly, but it is less likely to fracture at its sides and displace. Among its symptoms if it breaks in the middle are that it tilts downwards, exposes itself to pain, shortness of breath and suffocation.
"If there is bleeding and the fracture is evident in the bone, it should be immobilized by placing a bandage on its surface and between the shoulders, then compress from both sides to straighten it as much as possible.
"Press until the bone shape returns to its desired form, then place a bandage and compression on it. Place a splint of wood or metal over it in the armpit after having broken it through a small incision. Then, be gentle when binding it to the broken bone, so that it does not loosen. Pass the ligation around in a circular motion to the back several times and tighten it firmly. Then check the ligation at all times, and every time it is felt to have become loose.
If it is necessary to solve the problem in case of fracture or dislocation or fracture, then treat it and relieve what is apparent from it by its treatment method, then return the ligament if you see it for that purpose. Turn it over and force it to protrude until it comes out.
The eighth section.
In the case of dislocations, if they are fractured in those places that are on the back and their sides from the front, it is exposed to redness due to its being a sprain and knowledge of this is not hidden by the touch during examination with the fingers.
Force it to be straightened by the fingers on the side that can do so until its shape is equal to what is required, then tighten and set the broken bone with a traction if it requires that, for a fracture of dislocations close to the inside it is exposed to intense pain.
We incise as in an incision which is made to a person for the purpose that the bone may heal the wound and also exposes him to pain, swelling, bleeding profusely and this is difficult to treat, and the initial parts in it have frequently changed (into something else).
From them is one who says it is necessary to make the food of the patient produce gas and air so that the abdomen inflates and spreads, causing the fracture to push outwards which we dislike because it may lead to the occurrence of a severe burning worm if it doesn't happen, if it does happen, it increases and strengthens it.
Some of them say a block is placed on the site then compressed with strength, resembling a measurement but fearing that the block attracts pus to the site due to its weakness, and some of them say it is necessary to cover the site with a cloth soaked in hot oil.
A festering will occur between the openings until it is filled, for the ligature to be level when tied in a circular motion. Then, the patient is treated with the treatment of wounds from food and medicine. If the patient's condition becomes severe, it cannot bear such treatment. The bone fractures the covering, causing pain and fear of complications. It is necessary to make an incision at the site and reveal the broken part beneath it, then apply the tool which preserves the probe and describe it, and cut the bone along with it and remove it.
Then we gather the wound stitches if it is large by sewing and treat it with a probe until it heals, for if there is an exposed raw area and fever occurs, its benefits will be in warming the oil and place it at the site and treat the complication from within as well.
He lays on the side that avoids sleeping until it heals.
The Ninth Chapter.
Suturing the forehead and neck.
If the neck bones are fractured and exposed, or more likely prone to infection, as well as skull fractures, if this is visible to someone and you want to know if it heals or not. Look, if you see his hands become swollen, blackened and dead, and he is unable to move or stretch them, let alone grasp or hold them; if you squeeze or press them with a probe and he does not feel pain or find any pain there, then know that it will not heal in most cases, for he is dying.
If they move and feel with a quirk and a twinge, know that the fracture of the bone has healed and the cause has subsided. However, if it affects the backbone like this and you want to learn whether it also recovers or not, then it also recovers.
Look at his legs, if you see that they have been paralyzed and something similar to what happens in the hands has occurred, then if he lies on his back, gas and flatulence come out without intent, and if he presses on his abdomen, urine comes out without intent. If he presses on his abdomen to urinate and is unable to do so, then know that he is dying and do not concern yourself with treatment. For if nothing similar has happened to him in this regard, the matter is better. Treatment for what has occurred is to rub and soothe the painful wound.
Place warm oil of wool and nothing else, or with swabs soaked in beaten egg whites on the infected ulcer three times a day until the painful wound subsides. Then place one of the tight, clean bandages over the area and bind it tightly with a cord and tell him to rest and decide.
A patient shall not sleep except on the side where he does not find pain, until he is relieved. If something has happened near the joint in the bone, which can be relieved, it is necessary to incise the skin over it and remove that bone. Then gather the wounded eyes if it is large, by sewing. Then treat with salves until he is relieved. If the last bone of the radius and it is the ulna bone is broken, it is necessary to enter the probe from the left hand in the hollow socket.
Straighten the broken bone with the other hand as much as it is possible, and perform the setting process. Then put on bandages and splints if necessary, then set it.
If you sense a fractured shard in it, incise over it and remove it, then treat the wound with treatment until it is relieved.
Chapter Ten.
Treatment of wrist fracture.
When the bones of the wrist are broken, it will only be a fracture if it is displaced at its sides and fractured in length and inclines towards the inside and exposes to pain in that location and swells and stiffens the hand from which the fracture occurred.
Thou must examine his fracture with thy hand until thou art certain of its shape. If the fracture is at the edges only, then adjust that fracture as best thou canst to resemble its natural shape.
If the fracture is in length or if it has moved to the inside, place the patient on his back until you can feel that fracture. If you adjust it, apply a splint to it and then put a bandage over it, then tie a splint of wood or hide around it tightly.
Do not fear the fracture's displacement or splint's loss and adjust the deformity in the joints as much as possible to ensure the splint fits evenly, then order the patient to sleep on his back or correct side, for when he is presented with it, he will feel pain.
Wait for the swelling to subside and the pain to become bearable, then apply what will ease his pain. Then return to the fracture and tie it securely as necessary, for if there are splinters or breaks in the bone from its edges, they should not be removed.
Do not touch but adjust from the outside as we have said and leave it tied until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
In Surgery: Fracture Management.
The Limbs, from the joints to the shoulders, if fractured then surgery is required. One of the methods is to have a splint made of soft wood, moderately thick, as shown here:.
The splint is bound at the edges, then it should be raised from a high position and the patient is seated on a chair. Then his fractured arm is placed on the splint so that its broken part becomes attached firmly in the middle of the splint's arc, then something heavy is attached above it.
Or the patient is made to lie down, then the doctor adjusts the fracture with his hands until it is properly aligned. The other side should be such that the patient places his hand on his shoulder and holds it with a strap.
Then the servants are ordered to hold one of them above the fracture with his hand and the other below it, each pulling their respective ends. If you want the pull to be strong, tighten a strap under the fracture and another above it, and both servants pull towards their sides.
If the fracture is close to the joint, then the strap should be in the middle under the splint and another strap under the fracture towards the joint, and likewise if the fracture is near the joint, the strap should be at that position and also on the joint itself.
Then, the fracture is set with a splint of non-forceful material until the fracture reaches its desired level and heals properly. If it does not show any signs of infection or becomes warm, leave it as it is; if it shows signs of infection or becomes warm, wait until the seventh day, place on it a soft, wet cloth soaked in honey and oil.
Then, when the infection subsides, set the fracture, and its dressing should be applied to the fracture then a new splint is placed on top of it, and the limb is straightened on the body and his hand is kept open on the splint.
The fracture and the splint are applied to the limb, and the limb should be positioned such that the joint is in a stable position unless it prevents you from doing so or changes anything in the broken bone, then use crutches.
Place a crutch on the fracture that is straight and stronger than other crutches, and there should be a space between each crutch about the length of four fingers, and the length of the crutch should be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from every side.
Then apply the pressure mentioned in the first part of the chapter.
Make your pressure at the break point as strong as possible.
When you find the break and the pressure is less, if you see the instrument and the pressure as we said earlier when you press a limb from your hour, then do so.
If you fear the hot worm, leave it alone until the seventh day. Then examine the ligature in every three days so that no pressure or inflation occurs in the place, nor does food reach the member due to the persistence of the incision. This will heal everything as we have mentioned.
If you are certain that nothing of this will happen, do not remove the ligature except after many days, and the wound shall remain open on its surface and the hand shall be placed on it until it is healed, and a ligature filled with thread shall be placed under the member.
Examine at every moment, whether day or night, so that the shape of the broken bone does not change or the ligature is loosened, and this shall heal everything with your effort, and make the food for the wounded person on the level that we have mentioned as being mild first until the bones harden.
It is necessary that the food softens, for it is common in bones and tendons to harden in forty days, then it is necessary that it be removed and a steam bath is used and treated with the ointments which are suitable for that, for if the fracture is severe.
The suture should not be removed for less than fifty days or two months.
The second chapter is ten.
In the treatise on fracture of bones.
The bone, composed of two bones, is called the ulna and one of them is smaller, which lies towards the elbow, and the other is larger, situated below the smaller one; it is unlikely that only the largest or the smallest will fracture, and it is also unlikely that they will fracture together.
When the smaller upper ulna fractures, its treatment is easy and healing will be faster. When the lower ulna fractures, it is more difficult to treat and recovery is slower. If both bones fracture together, it is better if the bone that fractured the upper small ulna has fractured.
It is the duty of the physician to make the treatment period easy, until healing occurs; if the large ulna is fractured, he should make the treatment more difficult and if both bones are fractured, he should make the treatment period very strong.
The position of the hand should be set during treatment and the duration should be extended on a pillow. The elbow should be raised above all the fingers, and the wrist should be below the other fingers, with the back facing upwards.
"To make the wound heal in the elevation so that no complication occurs.
"Then, the servant of the limb moves from below either with his hand or with a rope and the other servant moves from above in the same way. Then the physician sets the bone until it is in its best possible shape, for if there is a fracture in the bone, it should be trimmed.
"Trim each splinter in its place with your effort, for if a splinter is found that does not pierce the skin and you do not attempt to move it, break it and remove it according to the method we mentioned earlier. If the fracture is accompanied by injury, then open its way with an instrument.
"Take the remedy for this from there, if pain appears in the first pressure and there is a hot swelling, make an incision with scissors made of ivory, ostrich bone or white lead and let it be moderately between cutting and burning. Hold it firmly until the swelling subsides.
"Remove the scissors, place the dressing made from flour with egg white, then take the poultices and let the one placed on the fracture be slightly more open and stronger. Also know that usually four poultices are needed for a limb.
The break is either in a single bone or in multiple bones together, then make your grip at the site of the break as strong and as firm as possible. Whenever you push with force, either upwards or downwards, make the push slightly more extended to what was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
The incision that causes damage to the broken bone should be a soft one, not too hard and the thread used for tying should be of moderate thickness between being thin and thick as we described earlier, and the limb and ligament should be examined after several days.
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as a fracture in the limb, it is necessary to immerse the limb in warm water until the fracture settles, then leave the limb undressed at night until it calms down, and then try to bind it again.
If the binding has healed and the bone has settled or something similar, fix it all you can. Also look, if food is preventing it from reaching the limb due to tight binding, relax it slightly and leave it for several days until food reaches it, then bind it again.
If nothing of what we mentioned has happened, it should not be treated except after twenty days or something similar, then the arm of the patient is tied to his neck and his arm should be kept at an angle and he should preserve its binding from violent movements and make him sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm takes thirty or forty days to heal, or two and thirty days; it may sometimes take eighty-two days, all depending on the condition of the patient and their strength.
The third chapter.
On the treatment of fractures of the hand and fingers.
The fracture of the hand and fingers is less common than their dislocation, but dislocation occurs much more frequently. When does a fracture or dislocation occur in the hand?
The injured person should sit up supported by pillows and facing a chair.
Then, he should place his hand in a sling, and the attendant of the broken bone should adjust it until the fracture is properly aligned. If there is no complication or fever, then a cast should be applied according to the situation.
If the break is below the wrist, make a ball from the plaster and order the patient to grasp it with his broken hand, then press firmly with the plaster of long length.
If the fracture is outside, it is necessary to make a plaster from above and another one below in the hand so that the hand remains extended upright.
Then the pressure is applied as the hand turns, and it is intertwined between the fingers by a rope. If the fracture is in one of Salamiah's fingers, and there is swelling, he should avoid pressing on what is necessary, then press with the hand and if desired, make a small upright plaster for the fracture.
If it does not move (the fractured part), it means the fracture is of all the fingers like the middle, thumb, index or little finger. He should be immobilized and connected to the correct finger, or connect them all to the splint. This is best, or place a small upright plaster on it.
As we have said before, in case of swelling and during or after bandaging, be ready for the warm inflammation, counter it with what is necessary whenever something like that occurs repeatedly, describe its occurrence.
Chapter Ten (al-Fascil al-Rabi'ashar)
In the field of surgery, on fracture of the leg.
The bone of the leg is often fractured and it becomes evident to touch because it shifts towards the front and back, and its joint (area surrounding the fracture) should be bound above and below the break with a splint that is laid directly on it.
Then, each splint should be stretched in the direction of the break if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But if it is near the joint of the leg, then a reinforcement should be applied either with tendon or similar material.
At the joint of the leg up to the ankle, the splint should be applied above and the other below the break, similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then the splint should be near the knee with the extension towards the lower part, then the doctor should align the bone using both hands until it matches its natural shape.
The bone heals well when it is properly splinted, so at this stage, it is necessary to apply the bandage and binding unless the limb develops a hot swelling. If a hot swelling occurs, then it should be left until the hot swelling subsides before treating it again.
In case of fracture, it is required to apply a wide, thin iron splint twice or thrice, leaving a protrusion. Then, the hand should be swabbed until the joint is near the wrist, and a long thread is inserted between the fingers and the toe, near the heel from below. The ends of the thread should be above both sides.
Then, the excess of the splint is trimmed on the finger and the toe, then a splint is placed in the position of the fracture on the finger and a single one is made on the bone of the toe. The void between the fingers and the toe is filled with thin plaster to align the fracture.
Then, the strong force is started from the center on the position of the fracture for three or four strokes, and each time a turn is made from the position of the fracture, the splint should be less, thinner and more flexible.
Then, move to the end of the thread that you inserted between the fingers and the toe, tie it with the splints from above, then pass by the end of the thread towards the bottom until it reaches the ankle, and tie both ends of the splints on the other side as well.
"So that the suture does not loosen from its place, then leave pressure on it as long as there is no signs of consumption or inflammation or abscess or pus, and do not blow [on it] nor fumigate with such things. If anything of this occurs, treat it and rectify everything that has occurred due to this, just as we have previously mentioned.
"If there is a splinter in the bone, it should be extracted if possible, otherwise break it and remove it and treat the wound as previously mentioned until healed. This fracture may heal crookedly without being set with a splint.
"As previously mentioned in the joints and limbs, except that a dislocation should not be reduced without proper support and if it is only dislocated without a splint, the patient must always have support.
"And know that a fracture takes between 50 days or slightly more or less, depending on the type of bone and other conditions.
"Chapter Five and Ten.
"On a fracture of the pelvis.
"The pelvis is less prone to fractures and more likely to have dislocations, so if a fracture occurs in the pelvis, it will either be a simple or compound fracture.
Apply pressure on that, all of it, with the fingers, making sure that it comes together from its parts until it meets and coalesces according to what can be united and bonded, and then it should bear weights, and a bandage should be placed over it if necessary.
Apply pressure on top of the pressure that suits that, then bind all the conditions we have described for the fracture such as burn wounds and similar cases by equating each opposite with what is suitable for it until it heals.
The Sixteenth Chapter.
On the Pressure of a Fractured Toe.
The toe has two bones, one of them is hard and is called the bone of the toe and the other is thin and is called tendon, and both are subject to various types of fractures that affect the bone of the finger. Therefore, the pressure for the toe is like the pressure for the finger and the method is one, if both bones are fractured, the toe will bend in all directions, and if the thin bone is fractured, the toe will bend towards the front, and if the hard bone is fractured from below, it is obvious to you.
Use the reed and bindage, and tie the bandages according to that, except that if the fracture of the toe is a sharp one with numerous shards, it is necessary for the pressure to be less and lighter, and make an effort in applying the pressure.
In the scrotum, for surgery, there is something added to the elbow. If you have prepared everything and finished all your work, take two pieces from a willow twig which are used in the treatment of cavities between the wall plates or from the reeds of palm or similar.
Choose from it something slightly thicker and not too hard, and its length should be the same as the scrotum from the hip to below, then roll each one into a spiral of the same length. Place one in the scrotum and the other on the opposite side.
Make it from the hip to below the foot, then tie the two rods in three places on both sides and in the middle. In this way, the scrotum will be prevented from moving to the right, north, and contracting, and a piece of wood of the same length as the scrotum can be used for this purpose.
Place it to keep it from moving and it is best to do this during a fracture if there is a specific injury, then check the scrotum every day and take good care of it to prevent infection or inflammation or anything else. If something of this type occurs, counter it with what is necessary to make it heal, and the bone of the finger will compress within thirty days or thereabouts.
The Seventh-Tenth Division.
On the fracture of bones in legs and fingers.
As for the humerus, it does not expose itself to a fracture; as for the bones of the leg, they may be exposed to fractures, and fingers also in less cases, but mainly to dislocations in most situations.
If the leg bones are exposed to fracture and you notice that some of them have shifted against each other, place your foot on the ground, squatting like a horse, then put your foot on whatever is raised above those bones, press and align them.
Until it returns to its place, then take a piece of cloth or a rope from above and put it under the underside of the foot on a small flat surface with two rounded ends, then tighten the foot firmly after pulling it using ropes or other necessary things.
If it passes three or four days, release the ropes; you will find that the bones are leveled as they were fractured or dislocated, so work accordingly. As for if one of the fingers is fractured, compress and align them according to what you have been described in the section on finger compression.
Then make a splint for the broken finger of the same length as the finger, and let it project slightly from it, then place under the foot this board which you have described and tighten it firmly. If the one who has been broken from bones is two or three or more.
Make a splint for each finger of its appropriate size and place it in soft padding, then tighten the board under the foot so that every end of the board projects outside the body of the foot to apply pressure correctly.
You should make sure not to forget all that we have discussed regarding the symptoms of any fracture, and each symptom as it is necessary.
Chapter 12.
On the fracture of a woman's womb, deafness bone, and man's bone.
If a woman's womb is broken, she should sit up, then tilt her to one side slightly and hold from behind, then compress the edges of her womb with cotton until it is filled and becomes like a ball within her womb.
Then the woman shakes and her uterus rises slightly, then the cotton will come out until it is near the opening of the womb like a ball, and the fracture of the bone returns. Then you make an incision on her abdomen when she wants to urinate, and remove the cotton until she defecates.
Apply it as you first introduced, then return to its original state after seven days or approximately, for it will heal, and if you wish to take a sheep's bladder, stretch it over its mouth with a funnel, and fill all of it into its sheath.
Then inflate the funnel with strength until the bladder inflates inside the sheath, so that the break returns, then sew it with cotton and let it rest for the time we described until it recovers. As for when a bone of the ear breaks in a man or woman, it is used in treatment.
Sew it as we have described for the bone of the ulna, and it is not hidden from you that the method in these strange breaks is more suitable for those who have some experience with this book, since the break itself guides you in most cases.
Follow the method in treatment and tighten it, and if a man breaks, take a splint of ox-hide and place the man inside it, then position a bandage made from straw around him and leave it for three days or approximately until it recovers.
The Tenth Chapter.
In the chapter of Fractures of Bones when there is an injury.
It is necessary for whoever presents to him with a fracture along with an injury, and especially if the bone is large like the shin or shoulder bones or similar, that he should attempt to separate it immediately if possible according to the conditions of separation as we have mentioned.
If the injury causes bleeding, it is necessary to attempt cutting it with a sharp, powdered pestle if no other option is available, then grasp the fracture on that day with your eyes and do not delay it.
If no fever occurs, but a fever does occur, leave the fracture until the ninth day to let the fever subside and do not approach it on the third and fourth days as it is exposed to adverse effects.
If the fractured bone is exposed to the skin, it is necessary to tie and set it with your hands along with a soft bandage, and if you are unable to tie and set it with your hand, tie it using this device which is made of iron about seven or eight fingers in length. Present it according to the severity of the injury.
"Therefore, the physician should take from it (the herb) three or four units according to what is required for treatment in each type of fracture. It should be ground, containing a little pumice so that it does not crumble when struck during operation.
"The edge should be sharp with a round tip, and above the tip it should be smooth up to the pumice and from half of it downwards it should be rough. This is its appearance.
"It is called the Yunanite wedge by the Greeks, which aims for a small cut. The edge should be sharp and pointed towards the fractured bone, and it should push against it once until the bone returns and aligns with some level. Then it forms a fitting of the fracture edges.
"If the fracture's edge is rough and the tool cannot grip it firmly, it should be cut until the tool can grasp it. If the bone cannot be aligned as described by the wedge, then it should be cut with the cuts we mentioned.
"Or it may be drilled with one of the saws as you can, then remove what remains of roughness and splinters in the bone. If the bone aligns after being drilled and a gap is found after alignment that causes great pain, then know that the bone did not return to its natural position.
If you can reduce it to its natural place, do so; for thus you will render great service to the patient. If your exertion be excessive in the operation upon bone, anoint it with a decoction of strong black wine. In summer, neither apply oil nor anything containing fat.
Avoid causing decay and corruption, then employ the leeches when you are free from the operation on bone and leave the wound open, applying pressure with a lintwrapped bandage according to its size.
Be cautious of all caution, lest you make the wound bleed excessively due to bone fracture for such an action often causes death or gangrene among patients. May your restraint be as gentle as a camel's kneading the sand in contrast to the excessive force of other fractures.
If the wound is small or large and you fear certain harmful symptoms as we have described, and you find no pain in that situation, do not apply leeches nor use bandages made of strong thread in the place of leeches. Instead, make soft lint bandages for the wound.
If, after a day or two, you see the wound beginning to fester, remove the probes that were inserted with wine and use lints and sutures which we commonly use for incisions like fine sutures, and it is advisable for you to dissolve the stitches.
Examine the wound every day, both in the evening and morning until it heals and closes, and it is best to set the limb so that the pus drains easily from it. If the wound persists for many days without healing or if the pus does not drain from it, then know that there are small fragments of bone.
It is necessary to examine the wound with a probe and, if it contains fragments of bone, to remove them and extract them in all directions. This can be done by forming a fist around the fracture and pulling it out.
If there is a wound that is swollen, infected or damaged in any way, it is necessary to treat each appearance with the appropriate treatment and describe it in its respective section.
If a large bone is broken and the limb, such as the leg or arm, is affected like the bones of the thigh or shoulder joint, do not attempt to manipulate or remove it. Often this leads to death, but leave it until it settles, for rarely does it dislocate after twenty or thirty days.
Here is the treatment for a wound if you see a place for it, otherwise leave it alone.
The Tenth Chapter.
Treatment of the swelling that occurs due to some fracture.
This swelling often occurs due to a fracture and is particularly noticeable near the joints, as it distorts the shape of the limb and may prevent the limb from performing its natural function.
If the swelling is hard, use medicines that soften it such as al-sibr, al-laban, al-marr, al-anzarut, and al-aqaqiya and similar ones by taking some or all of them, grinding them into a paste with a binding liquid such as wine, white of egg, or flour.
Apply the paste on the swelling, press it hard and leave the pressure for a number of days until it softens; then release the pressure and repeat the process until the swelling disappears, if Allah wills, or press a hard piece of lead on it.
The lead has a specific property that destroys all that it comes into contact with, so if the swelling has become hardened and firm, and there is a need to remove it, make an incision from above and cut away the affected tissue or burn it with one of the cauterizing agents until it disappears and treats the wound until it heals.
Chapter Ten and Forty.
In the treatment of fractures, if it heals and the limb remains tender besides its original state.
If a bone fracture heals and the limb remains tender after that, it is due to many reasons. One of them may be due to excessive loosening of ligaments and their binding on something other than what is appropriate, or due to the tightening of the ligaments to such an extent that food cannot reach the limb, or due to excessive and uncontrolled shaking, or due to movements at inappropriate times, or due to a lack of blood in the body of the patient and its weakness.
Treatment for this is feeding the patient, fattening his body until blood increases in him, using a cupping glass and placing leeches on it, and other similar methods, then placing a bandage on the limb to attract the bandage to it abundantly or to keep shaking it with warm water. until food passes through him and he returns to his natural state.
Chapter Twenty and Ten.
In the treatment of fractured bones that heal in a curved shape and are prevented from performing as they should be.
When a fractured or dislocated bone is set improperly, its appearance changes. Unless the bone is allowed to heal naturally, it is not correct to claim that a bone can be broken from its tip, as many ignorant physicians and bone setters do in our country.
This action is highly dangerous as it causes severe pain to the patient, but if the swelling and dislocation are treated properly, it is necessary to immerse the affected area in boiling water containing healing herbs such as mulberry leaves, onion peel, garlic, ginger, and similar.
Bind with healing ointments such as diachylon or take the root of mulberry, pound it along with chicken fat and apply it, or use walnut oil mixed with soap powder and apply it, among the medicines known as pain relievers.
When the dislocation has become fixed and severe, use a slender, thin needle to manipulate the joint in all directions at each opportunity. If the swelling persists and worsens, it may require treatment with iron.
It is required that the incision be made above [the area] and the connection of the bone be severed, and what exceeds the ligament or bone should be cut off with care and attention. Then, the wound should be treated as he has described until it heals.
The third and forty-first chapter.
The jaw is the separation of a joint from its place, which prevents movement and causes the shape of the bone to change and pain or injuries to occur due to some cause, so when someone has a jaw problem, it is necessary that he go immediately to its opposite [side].
Do not delay the setting of a broken jaw, for if it is delayed, the movement of the jaw will become difficult and setting the jaw may cause swelling and painful injuries. Therefore, it is not appropriate to delay or move or touch it when it is injured because often, due to some cause, swelling and painful injuries occur.
But if it occurs, he should immediately go to the cause of the injury and then wait until the swelling subsides a little, then heat the bone with hot water and oil, then set it using a splint and treat each bone according to what is described in its place.
The sections of the lower jaw have also been set in accordance with what comes first in the fracture from top to bottom, [in repair].
The fourth and fifth sections.
In the treatment of lower jaw fractures.
In the treatment of jaw fractures, it is not permissible to pull them out except in the case of dislocation where it is easy to reduce [the fracture] a little and then they are bound; or if they are broken completely and need to be pulled out completely until they are reduced. It is like striking the chest to relieve pain for a patient who cannot grasp it and cannot endure having his jaw set, or if it is dislocated easily, then it usually returns by itself more easily.
If the dislocation is complete and total, it is necessary to quickly return it and not delay it, because the assistant holds the patient's head and the doctor enters his hand into the mouth of the jaw from inside if the jaw is on one side.
Or he enters both hands if the jaw is on both sides and all his fingers from outside smooth it, and he orders the patient to open and close his jaw, while the doctor smoothes the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
If it is difficult to extract and it is not doubtful that both the incisors are affected, use a substance with hot water and oil until it eases their extraction and does not delay their extraction as we have said. When they return and align and fit well, there is a cause for concern and they do not move freely, then place a splint on them made of cotton, oil and lead.
Then tie with a soft bandage, and let the patient lie on his back with his head slightly elevated between two pillows to prevent movement from right or left, and not to affect the neck, but to make his food smooth and easy to swallow.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is closed, let him eat what pleases him, and it should not be done while he is holding his mouth open during eating and drinking or coughing until the jaw is closed and healed.
If the extraction of the incisors is difficult when they have broken at a time and do not go to their respective places, it often leads to abscesses, chronic pain, and perhaps the patient's stomach will swell or he may have recurrent fits. If you see that, know that it is damaged.
Often it dies from that in ten days.
The fifth chapter and the fiftieth.
In the treatment of dislocation and disarticulation.
As for dislocation, it does not dislocate from the internal side due to its connection with the chest, but it may dislocate towards the outside which can be felt, and it must be compressed so that the affected limb is pressed against its opposite surface.
Then, the location is compressed with the hand with force, and it returns. Then, a splint and bandage are placed on it and it is tightly fixed. As for the part of it that lies towards the disarticulation and is connected to it, it does not dislocate except in cases of extreme necessity. If it dislocates, it should be reduced and set according to what has been mentioned, and it should be made ready for you.
Then, a splint and bandage are placed on it, and tightened. The patient is ordered to rest and refrain from movement until he recovers, and with this treatment the dislocation of the disarticulation will return to its place if it has moved away.
The sixth chapter and the sixtieth.
In the treatment of disarticulation.
Know that disarticulation may occur in three ways: one is that it dislocates towards the shin bone downwards, and the second is that it dislocates towards the chest, and most likely it dislocates upwards, and this occurs in cases of extreme necessity.
Should not be probed towards the back at the location of the armpit, nor towards the front at the location of the elbow; it most frequently exits obliquely, similar to a finger, and especially in those with little flesh as it quickly emerges and quickly enters.
As for those with much flesh, it means that it (the foreign body) will come out slowly and enter slowly; some people may experience a blow or fall which causes inflammation of the affected area and they believe that it has been probed; in such cases, it is necessary to confirm its status.
Then you proceed in treatment, and the probe is recognized if it exits obliquely similar to a finger when touching the affected and healthy areas; in this case, you will find a difference between them visibly and you will find the tip of the probe with a hollow and under the skin upon touch, as if it were an egg.
The culprit cannot raise his hand to his ear or move it in all directions, and similarly, if the probe is near the chest or above, you will find this apparent upon touch, it is not hidden.
This fracture can be easily reduced if it is in a straight or if the cause is a child, and it should be done by raising the servant's hand above, then making you place your hand underneath his armpit and lifting the separated part with force to its place, and the servant raises his hand and pushes it above.
Then he should push it down, for it will return quickly; if it does not return as mentioned earlier and the fracture has been for many days, then it is necessary to immobilize the cause in hot water and use a splint that resembles cooking a leg of mutton and boiling milk and using eggs in hot water and using it.
Then the cause should be placed on his back and a round cushion made of yarn with a balance between softness and firmness should be placed under his armpit, then the doctor will place his foot on the cushion and hold the cause and push it down.
The cushion is pushed with his foot, for it will return to its place; if you want to reduce it in this way, prepare a man taller than the cause and stop him from the side and let him enter from behind under the armpit of the cause and lift his arm up until the cause is suspended in the air. The last servant should draw the stone down from his patient's abdomen. If it is light, something else must be tied to it to weigh it down, as it may return after an hour. It could also happen on another surface.
Place a long piece of wood with its tip shaped like the handle of a balance, neither too thick nor too thin, under the stone. Then place an iron spike on both the end of the wood and the stone, and let it stand vertically on the length of the wood.
Then move his hand towards the other side, and his body also from the opposite side with force. The fracture will return quickly to its place. If it becomes difficult to reduce it by all means mentioned, then apply this treatment. It is to take a piece of wood about forearm length. Display her as long as four fingers and sharpen her tip to the length of two fingers, so that she will have a curved head which makes it easy for her to enter deeply into the intestine in this manner.
Then, attach a soft ligature to the curved head so that it does not harm the underlying intestine. Then, pass the splint underneath the intestine and move the hand and arm down on the splint and secure it to the body and assisting member and the side of the hand.
Then, the arm is placed on the anvil. Strike a blow with the hammer and move the hand downward while leaving the rest of the body hanging from the other side, for the splint will enter through its opening. If it enters on any side, it must be placed under the intestine with a ball of yarn of equal size.
Then, the bandage made from embers of the mill and lime with egg white is placed on everything as it rotates from above. Then, the ball is struck firmly from beneath the skin with a forceps and it turns with the cord onto the bandage, and his hand is tied to his neck.
He should leave his hand motionless for seven days, and it is recommended to make the diet of the patient light until the limb becomes strong, as it heals faster. Then, after seven or five days, he should move it gently; if it stays in place without swelling, then it has been cured.
If the patient's wound continues to discharge frequently due to moisture or other causes, then it is necessary to use three sifavids in each opening mentioned in the chapter of sifavid, as long as they are prepared and the cord is cut after seven days, but the wound has not healed.
If the bandage and pressure applied to it were repeated, but the wound did not heal and fell open again and swelled, and it could not be raised above, then know that the nerve in the end of the limb has been severed or stretched or swollen; therefore, if the wound does not heal at its place, then it will never heal.
"As for the fissure that is similar to the chest and shoulder, extending towards the back, it should be forced open with fingers until it returns. All kinds of pressure and treatment are applied to it until it heals. If its appearance remains in the limb after healing, it will be stiff and limited in movement.
"The caustic should not be applied repeatedly until the stiffness and restricted movement return to their original state.
"Chapter Seven and Forty
"In the treatment of fissure of the anus.
"A fissure in the anus is difficult to heal as it heals slowly and reopens easily, spreading to all directions, both towards the front or the back. The healing of this fissure is not hidden from you because it occurs under the sight and touch in any shape.
"If the anus with fissure is treated correctly, it will become evident to you by the swelling of the fissure and its inability to be touched or moved, and it is important that you force and push the fissure away from your time before it becomes infected and hot.
"If it becomes infected and hot, forcing and pushing it back is difficult, and rarely does the fissure heal completely if it is towards the back. The fissures in this case are the most painful and severe, and death often accompanies them.
If it is a part that can be returned, when the servant puts both his hands and his arm extended, and the hand of the physician is from above and below, and he pushes the separation with the palms of his hands entirely or with the back of his fist until it returns to its place.
If the fracture is in front, it can be returned by bending the hand repeatedly until the fingertip struck by the fracture is reached, then if it does not need to return, use strong force and it is to pull the arm of the servant.
The attendant also holds the servant to prevent him from slipping during the pulling, then rotate the arm in all directions after striking it with his hand, and if the physician pushes the separation, he wipes it with oil so that it will adhere easily at the point of fracture.
Then push the separation forcefully until it returns, and after its return, it is necessary to apply a bandage that has been dried and whitened with lime, and tighten it firmly, and leave the arm tied by the attendant for some days.
Then if it (the wound) heals in its place, leave the sutures; if you see that the separated part does not worsen, repeat the suturing and leaving it for days until it worsens, then remove it. If something similar happens to it after the separated part has returned and removed.
And if it becomes difficult in movement, do not use massage in the bath and soft delicately rubbing or tapping until it clears up, or place a cotton swab soaked in perfume on the separated part, then suture it and leave it for days and nights, then remove it and let him enter the bath; if it becomes inflamed, pierce the separated part with a balanced incision.
Then apply cotton swabs to it repeatedly, three times while entering the bath until it clears up; if you wish, you can place damp wool from a sheep with oil on it and press it onto him; do this several times as it will clear up and return to its original state.
The eighth and fortieth section.
On the treatment of dislocated bones.
A dislocated wrist is often difficult to reduce and re-dislocates easily, it is necessary to quickly reduce the dislocation in the hour when it occurs before it settles or is exposed to heat.
Place the probe in a location and let your servant press his hand. The physician then places his fist on the divided part and pushes it back, unless it should be noticed that the fracture has returned to the interior of the hand.
Place the probe on the surface of the hand and press, and if the fracture is apparent in the exterior of the hand, place your other hand on the table so that your hand may be placed on the same divided part. If it returns, no action needs to be taken; otherwise, apply pressure firmly for relief of pain.
Leave it alone as it will not recover after some days, unless the fracture remains on a curve and causes no harm to the probe except if the hand swells or it cannot be grasped.
When the nerve is severed or crushed, there is no remedy for it except to bind it with the bandage mentioned previously, then apply pressure and leave it for five days.
Then it heals and the hand is motionless or shows some signs of stiffness. If this occurs, immerse it in hot water and massage it repeatedly until it becomes supple.
Chapter Nine and Forty.
Treatment of Dislocated Fingers.
If a finger gets dislocated to any side, when it is dislocated towards the exterior of the hand or its interior, extend and straighten the finger, then push the joint back with your force until it returns, then tie the end of the finger and bind it towards the direction it was dislocated.
Leave it for a couple of days, then release and extend it until it adjusts to its position on that day, if it is night, tie it according to the same description and do not remove it during the day and exercise it with movement and bind it at night, continue doing this for as many days as necessary until it strengthens.
And the same is done if it gets dislocated to the interior of the hand, tie it towards the direction it was dislocated and do what you originally did until it comes out, and the same is done when it gets dislocated to any other side.
Chapter Thirty.
Treatment of Dislocation of the Occiput (the back part of the skull).
If the occiput or neck vertebrae gets dislocated, or if several occiputs are displaced from their places, there is no treatment as death approaches quickly.
The sign that the ulna is fractured is that it comes out without intention and cannot be grasped, and frequently a part of it sprouts either from its lower end or upper arm, or one of them; and if a piece stays away from its original position, it often falls off.
The fracture can occur in four directions, of which one that falls to the back is called a condyle, and as for its treatment, it is to observe if the condyle has happened due to scabies, then there is no treatment or relief from it; but if it happens due to a fall or blow, etc.
It has been mentioned in the early texts on treatment in a lengthy language, of which not much remains useful; I have abridged it to what is sufficient for understanding and explanation, and I have depicted the instrument differently from how it appears and explained it.
The condyle that happens in the front of the chest has no treatment or relief, and similarly for the one on two sides; but only the one happening in the back is treated specifically as I have described, which is to pull the ulna onto its face.
On a low table, near the wall and spreading it out, wet it so as not to hurt his chest. Then place an upright piece of wood in a hole on one side of the table, towards his head, and another piece of wood towards his feet on the other side of the table.
The attendant holds one piece of wood firmly in the hole, and another attendant holds the other at its base. Then they strike the patient's chest with force and cover his back with a soft and firm blanket, and the edge of the blanket is attached to the piece of wood that is near his head.
Then the other blanket is stretched over his shoulders and back, reaching his feet at the back of his neck, and all the threads are gathered and tied together on the second piece of wood that is near his feet. Each attendant takes hold of one end of the blanket with a thread, but neither piece of wood moves from its centered position.
The pieces of wood are not firmly fastened as we have said, and the doctor places his hands on them with force until they move or he places a board over them. Then he rests on the board with his feet until they return to their original position. If this treatment does not work, he takes a board which is about three finger-breadths in width.
Drill a hole at the place we mentioned to be near the artery, then insert the flat end of the probe into it. Place the center of the probe on the artery and let the doctor's leg rest on the other side and press hard until the artery pulsates.
Return to its place, if you wish to make it with a cane that is held by the hands and has a notch at the top near the artery's location, then make two wooden pegs of equal length, one for each end of the cane.
Let the cane be between each wooden peg and make a groove in each of them for the cane to move through. Each wooden peg should be firmly planted in the ground, so that the body does not move and the rotating lever, which is the cane with a loop attached to it, fits into the grooves of the wooden pegs.
On one side, make a groove and insert a lever of the same length as the cane in it, similarly on the other wooden pegs. Then tighten the cord that you tied around the artery in the cane at its head, and tighten the cords attached to it at both ends of the lever.
Then, the servant stands by each tumor and strikes it with a mace that is coated with the mace used for the tumor and the physician applies heat to the abscess as we have described, and this is an image of the tumor, the boil, and the incision.
Then, when the iron cools and the position is stable, it should be lifted with the heated pads made of white cloth. Then, a flat blade should be placed on top of the pads, its width three fingers or similar, and its length equal to the size of the abscess.
On some suitable nails, then bind with the cord that is required and use soft food until it bursts. If there remains a little pus in the position at the end of the bursting, it is necessary to use the medicines that soothe and soften along with the use of the blade which we have described for a long time.
In such a case, a lead blade may be used, and it is possible that the pus remains at the end of backbone fractures, which is likely to remain as excess bone that cannot be treated with this method for fear that death might occur.
The thirty-first chapter.
In treating the hernia that is protruding.
Know that the ligament of the hernia and the ligament of the scrotum are only exposed to the cut, but not to all the other ligaments such as the bladder and the intestine. The ligament of the hernia opens in four directions.
That is because it opens towards the inside and outside, and in front and behind, and mostly towards the inside and less so towards the front or back. A sign of the opening towards the inside is that if you place your fingers correctly on the patient's groin, it will be longer.
The hernia is more likely to be incorrect than correct, and it is not possible for the man to urinate while he is an Arab or for his penis to reach there due to swelling before it has reached that place.
The sign that the cut is exposed towards the outside will be its opposite symptoms, and the sign that the cut is exposed towards the front is that it spreads his legs completely, but it does not separate it except when there is pain in the hernia and if he walks, he cannot do so towards the front.
When the foot swells and the ankle is affected during walking, it indicates that the calf muscle is exposed at the back. If the calf does not stretch or cannot be straightened before the ankle can be straightened, it also indicates that the problem is closer to the heel than to the other side.
The ankle is sprained and the foot's heel is visible in its hollowed position, as for the types of this sprain, it means that if the sprain has been with the person for some time and they have not tried to straighten it and it remains in its state, there is no treatment for the swelling.
It should not be exposed to it, and as for the one who has sprained their ankle from any of its four aspects, it is necessary that you gently separate the swollen part, move it inwards and outwards, and move it up and down smoothly.
He returned and did not require any treatment other than this, if it does not return in this way, it is necessary that a strong assistant holds the foot from below, either with their hand or with a strap attached to the foot above the ankle, and the second assistant pulls it from above.
His hand should enter from below his navel, then he should squeeze with thin linen thread on the root of the finger and hold it with an assistant from another side, either from the right side to the left or from the back to the front.
Each of them should be tied all at once until the intestine rises with its contents from the ground and remains suspended, for this type of tying belongs to all four types. If the intestine does not return as we have stated, then it is necessary for each type to undergo the treatment that we have mentioned.
If the intestine has been brought out, it should be returned to its proper side, then cotton thread should be tied on the root of the finger in the area between the base of the finger and the navel.
Then the thread should be pulled up from the navel side to the top of the abdomen towards the back, then an assistant should grasp the thickened part of the intestine with his two hands and pull it out forcefully, for it will return to its place.
This type of treatment is easier than other types of treatments for this organ, but if you find it difficult and do not need to perform this type of treatment by emasculation, then it is necessary to tie the testicles with strong threads around the scrotum and the penis.
After each of them (the fingers), it should be able to span four digits. The little finger should be longer than the other one, spanning two digits. Then he attaches the little finger to a stick in the house, followed by a distance of two forearms.
Then order a strong boy to hold the head of the bone and attach it to the little finger. Let another boy then pull the one holding the bone with force so that the fracture returns quickly to its place, but if the bone is set incorrectly.
The little finger should be placed on the splint as described in the case of the humerus fracture and the bandage should be tightly wrapped around it specifically and also around its neck. Then two sticks are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head. A third stick is put in the middle of the splint, firmly secured.
A soft paste is spread over it to prevent pain in the little finger, so that there is wood between its fingers to avoid sliding down during movement. Then each servant goes to his side and the physician adjusts the splint with his hands. If he responds to being returned to its place.
Unless he is bandaged as we have described in the book of fractures, it should be ensured that the limb to be treated is in its correct position. If the displacement is towards the front, the limb should be manipulated once and this will be on this description with the eye on the plaster.
The physician places his left hand on the fractured extremity and then presses it with the other hand, exerting pressure gradually towards below, towards the side of the knee. If the displacement is towards the back, it should not be manipulated downwards.
He should be elevated above the ground, but it is necessary that he be placed on a solid surface. It is also necessary that he be bound from the neck to the feet, as we have described in our description of fractures, and the bandages are securely tied.
As we have said, the bandaging should also be applied to the site of the fracture. If the bone has returned to its place, this will be indicated by the finger moving towards it, and you will not miss it.
If you see them level and the limb contracts and relaxes without difficulty, then know that the bone has returned to its place. At this point, bind the bones firmly with bandages and wrap them tightly so the bone does not move in any direction.
The patient must be immobilized. The swelling should subside for three or four days, then the sutures and bandages should be removed and the wound should be probed with another finger, if they appear equal, know that the fracture has set, release the patient to walk, but if you see any signs of instability.
Return and bind it tightly and set it as best you can, then leave it for three days, then remove the bandage and let him walk on it until it heals, if Allah wills.
The second and third sections.
On the treatment of a collarbone fracture.
A collarbone fracture breaks in three directions, into the inside, outwards and downwards, meaning towards the back but not towards the shoulder joint. A sign of a fracture is when the patient commands the immobilizer to move his finger.
If it does not bind with the hand, know that the collarbone is broken. All directions of the fracture must be stabilized by having the immobilizer sit and hold his arm straight while a servant sits behind him to support and gently pull it towards the back, then you sit on his hands.
Place the back of your hand on his face, make his leg between your legs, then make him ride with your palms and interlace them between your fingers while riding, then grasp his sides with your palms on the ride strongly, and let another servant pull his leg until the ride returns to its place.
The sign of its return is that the string attaches to the bone without being twisted, then it is tightened and the string is attached to the bone, then they are tied together with three ligatures for three or four days, then they are released. It should not be used except by walking a little for some days until it strengthens.
If it is difficult for you to make it return as we have described, then apply the strong pull with the ligatures that were explained in the treatment of varicose veins until it returns.
The third and thirty-third chapter.
Treatment of dislocation of the shoulder.
The shoulder may dislocate easily and completely or incompletely, and when it is dislocated, it may be internal or external, and the sign of dislocation is that you see the shoulder bulging out on the side to which it has been dislocated.
As for the treatment of dislocation, it is easy to reduce and consists of applying a strong pull with the hands until it returns, and as for its treatment if it has completely dislocated, the patient should sit upright and be held by a strong servant from behind on his chest.
Then grasp your right hand with the foot from above and your left hand with the foot from below, in the position of the umbilicus (navel). Then move the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand twice, then straighten it with your left hand and push the sole of the foot with your right hand towards the heel without force.
Then perform that action as described twice, then push the sole of the foot towards the heel in the third movement and you are moving with the navel (umbilicus). If it returns during either of these movements or when it is leveled, adjust the procedure; otherwise, it will return.
If it persists in returning as described, then place a cloth on the back of it on the ground and tie it securely to the ground between his feet so that it does not harm the servant (helper), then the assistant adjusts the foot.
Then the second assistant moves the leg either with his hands or with a rope tied around its neck, and each assistant moves differently from his companion. While one holds the heel to prevent the body from moving down during adjustment, the doctor straightens the limb with his hand.
The last attendant shall seize the healthy sack and draw it down, for the fakk will return quickly. If the fakk returns and becomes clear to you, take hold of the cord and the ligature, tighten them with cords and ties, then press your foot on the lower cords. It is advisable to be careful from the pressure that shall be above the anus, from behind.
Do not make the cord too tight, for it may hurt him. Then leave it for a few days or three. If the cord weakens, tighten it again and release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If the patient walks before this period, it is not assured that the fakk will heal and not deteriorate or accept treatment after that. If his gait becomes hot, it is necessary to use what has been described in other treatments and wait until he recovers.
The Fourth and Thirtieth Chapter.
Treatment of Fakk Affecting the Finger of a Man.
It is advisable to wash the affected area with an easy-to-use liquid that is not harsh, and if the fakk is in one of the toes of the foot, it is necessary to make the patient place his foot on a level surface.
And upon a table, and he is standing like a statue, then you come and place your foot on the place of the fracture, then you press it with force until it returns and you see that it has been dislocated and not yet visible in its place.
Then make a board to hold the foot with two ends, then press it firmly and accurately for three days, then break it and let it heal from walking for many days until it becomes strong and safe for return, if God wills.
Chapter Fifty Third.
On types of jaw that may be accompanied by injury or fracture, or both together.
When something like this happens and treatment is attempted, it often results in death.
Therefore, it should not be attempted to treat such cases except by one who is skilled in the art, with long experience, sharp and keen senses, free from defects and without dislocations; and only medicines that soothe hot swellings should be used, and patience should be exercised.
God grant us protection from the affliction with mild illness, and make it appear to you in him some hope before the pain occurs. Formulate your remedy quickly in the initial stage of the illness before the swelling becomes hot.
If a limb returns to its desired position, apply the treatment that dwells in the hot swellings and heals wounds with properly dried cupping glasses. If the jaw has returned with a break and there are free fragments of bone in it, remove them. Correspond to that what we mentioned in the simple diseases, which precedes its conditions.
Exert yourself, purify your soul from entering the path of error as it approaches and obey my advice for that will preserve your self and surrender to its exposure if God wills it.
