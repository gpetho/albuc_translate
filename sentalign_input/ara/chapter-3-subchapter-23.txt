Chapter Twenty-Three.
On the Jaw.
Dislocation of the jaw is a displacement of the joint from its place, which hinders movement, deforms the appearance of the limb, and causes severe aches and pains to the patient.  Whenever someone experiences a jaw dislocation, it should be promptly reduced.
It should not be delayed at all, for if it is delayed, the area will swell, making it difficult to reduce the jaw. Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor should it be moved or stretched while swollen, because it often causes convulsions and harmful pains to the patient.
But if this happens, it is necessary to immediately bleed the patient, then leave it until the swelling subsides a little, then anoint the limb with hot water and oil, then gently reduce it and treat each limb as will be mentioned in its place.
I have also arranged the chapters on the jaw according to what preceded in the fracture, from the top of the body to the bottom.
