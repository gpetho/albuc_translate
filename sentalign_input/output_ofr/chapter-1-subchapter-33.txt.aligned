And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the spine, and a cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach next to the large one, for the treatment is beneficial when there is good assistance/constitution.	And if you see that the humidities are superabundant, and the patient fit to tolerate it, then make one cauterization over the groin and one over the hypochondrium. You may also add two small ones over the stomach near the big one. This is an effective treatment that does not fail to help.	0.738382
