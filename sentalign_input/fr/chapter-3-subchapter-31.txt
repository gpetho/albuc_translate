Of the dislocations of the hip  
Know that the joints of the hip and the shoulder only suffer dislocations, not other injuries like other joints; and the hip joint dislocates in four directions: inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards; more inwards than elsewhere, and rarely forwards or backwards.  
And the recognition of its dislocation inwards is that when the injured leg is compared with the healthy one, it is longer, and the patient's knee appears more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee properly.  
And the area near it is swollen with a hot abscess because the head of the thigh bone comes there.  
And the signs of the one whose dislocation is outwards are that these symptoms are opposite to those before.  
And the signs of the one whose dislocation is forwards are that he extends his leg well completely; however, he cannot bend his knee without pain, and if he tries to walk, he cannot move forward, and retains his urine, and the groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.  
And the signs of the one whose dislocation is backwards are that he cannot extend his knee or bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh bone is located below the ribs.  
The reduction of this type of dislocation is to check if the dislocation is old, and if it remains as it is, there is no cure; and it is not necessary to assume otherwise.  
And in the one whose dislocation is recent, and it is of the four types of dislocation, quickly turn the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; possibly it will return, and no other treatment is needed.  
And if it does not return in this way, it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with both hands, or with a band tied above the knee.  
And another assistant extends his hand above in such a manner that he places his hands under the armpits, then ties a soft band above the thigh; and another holds the end of the band.  
And they extend upwards and downwards all at once, until the patient is lifted off the ground at once, and remains hanging.  
This method of extension is common to all four types, and if the dislocation returns, as we have said, it is good.  
If not, it is necessary to treat it according to its type. When the dislocation is inwards, lay the patient on his healthy side, then place the band at the base of the thigh, and the area below the groin, then extend the band upwards towards the groin and the hip bone.  
Then another assistant takes his arms, and embraces the thick part of the injured thigh, and extends it outwards strongly: it will return to its place immediately; and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.  
And if you cannot set it in this way as we have said, it is necessary to tie the patientâ€™s two feet together with a strong soft band around the two heels and around the two knees, and let the injured leg be extended two fingers more than the other.  
Then hang from the head of a stick, and be two arms' length above the ground; then command one assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and another assistant hanging with the patient, who strongly embraces the thigh, for the joint will return immediately and quickly.  
And when the dislocation is outwards, let the patient lie as we have said for one with kyphosis, and tie a band around the injured leg properly, and around the foot as well.  
Then place two sticks, one at the head and another at the feet, then drive a stick between the patient's thighs in the middle.  
And wrap it with moist cloths around, so it does not hurt the patient, then each assistant extends towards him, and the practitioner sets the dislocation with his hand.  
If it returns, it is good. If not, place it on a table, and press it as we have said for kyphosis, and let the patient lie on his healthy side.  
And when the dislocation is forwards, it is necessary to extend the injured leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and the practitioner places his effort on the injured groin, then presses with the other hand, and extends it down towards the knee.  
And if the dislocation is outwards, it is not necessary to extend the patient downwards, nor to lift him off the ground, rather it is necessary that he be as if the hip were dislocated outwards, as we have said about lying on both hips.  
And be on his stomach, and the bands extended as we have said before, and press on the joint at the table.  
And it will be right when the patient extends his legs, and they will be equal; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind with a band, so that the hip does not move.  
And rest for three or four days, then untie, and apply the plaster; and if you see that they are equal, then bind it as before, and leave it for three days; then untie, and let him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
