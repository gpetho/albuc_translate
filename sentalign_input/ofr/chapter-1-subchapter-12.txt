of the water of the eyes
When water first comes to the eyes, by the signs I have mentioned in the division, then begin by giving the patient a drink that cleanses the head, and protect him from all moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times while fasting.
Afterwards, tell him to shave his head, and make a cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on both temples if the flow of water is in both eyes together, or in one if the flow is in one eye;
and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple;
and beware of excessive bleeding, and if you see too much blood coming out, stop it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and at the incision the precaution of how you will stop it;
and sometimes one makes a cautery or cauterization under the two bones behind.
