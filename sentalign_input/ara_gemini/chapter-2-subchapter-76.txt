Chapter seventy-six on the extraction of the dead fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus with the treatment I mentioned in the division, and it did not come out, and you are forced to work by hand, then you should look. If the woman is of sound strength and has none of the symptoms that are feared to cause her harm, then the woman should lie down on a bed on her back, with her head tilted downwards and her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body is not pulled when the fetus is extended.
Then moisten the opening of her womb with moist oils, along with the saliva of marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and salivas, then insert it gently into the womb, then search for a place to insert the hooks into the fetus.
And the appropriate places for that, look, if the fetus is coming down head first, then insert the hooks into its eyes, or in the back of its head, or in its mouth, or in its jaw, or under its chin, or its collarbone, or in the places near the ribs, or under the cartilage.
But if it is coming down feet first, then in the pubis and middle ribs.
And you should hold the hook with the right hand and place its bend between the fingers of the left hand, and insert the hand gently, and insert a hook in some of those places that we mentioned until you reach something empty, then insert another hook or a third opposite it if you need to, so that the pull is even and does not tilt to one side, then extend it evenly, and the extension should not be straight only, but move it to each side to facilitate its exit, as is done with a tooth when extracting it, and it should be loosened between pulls. If one side of it gets stuck, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from one side to rotate what is stuck. If part of the fetus comes out, then move the hooks to other places that are a little higher. Do this until the entire fetus comes out.
If a hand comes out before anything else and cannot be pushed back because of its compression, then you should wrap a cloth around it and then pull it until, when it all comes out, you cut it either at the wrist joint or at the elbow, and so you should do with the other hand and with the legs.
If the head of the fetus is large and there is pressure on it during exit, or if there is fluid accumulated in its head, then you should insert a pointed scalpel between your fingers and incise the head so that the fluid comes out, or perforate it with the instrument called the perforator, whose image comes with the images of all the instruments in the chapter after this. And so you do if the fetus is naturally large-headed, then you should incise the skull or crush it with the perforator as we said, then remove the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out and is compressed at the collarbone, then incise it until the moisture in the chest pours out, for then the chest will contract. If the chest does not contract and it is not possible to exit, then cut it in pieces as much as you can.
If the lower abdomen is swollen or has a swelling, then you should puncture it so that the moisture drains from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, then pulling it is easy and aligning it to the opening of the womb is simple.
If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then you should pull it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand and incise the abdomen or chest until what is in them drains.
If all the other limbs have been extracted and the head has receded and is stuck, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If the opening of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand into the cervix and search for the head and pull it with her fingers to the opening of the womb, then insert a hook or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
If the opening of the womb has closed due to a hot swelling that has occurred, then it should not be forced, but rather the pouring of moist, fatty things should be used, and bandages should be applied, and she should sit in water that softens and moistens.
But if the fetus is on its side, then if it can be aligned, use what we mentioned for the live fetus. If this is not possible, then cut it into pieces and remove it.
And you should not leave any of the placenta inside at all.
When you have finished your treatment, use the treatment we mentioned for hot swellings that occur in the wombs.
If bleeding occurs, then she should descend into astringent water and use the rest of the treatment.
I witnessed a woman who had conceived, and the fetus died in her womb, then she conceived again, and the other fetus also died. After a long time, a swelling appeared in her abdomen and swelled until it opened and began to suppurate. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close. I applied some strong drawing ointments to it, and a bone came out of the place, then after a few days, another bone came out. I was surprised by this, since the abdomen is a place without bone, so I estimated that it was from the bones of the dead fetus. I searched the wound and extracted many bones from the head of the fetus. I continued to follow this until I extracted many bones, and the woman was in the best of health. She lived like that for a while, suppurating a little from the place. I have brought this rare case here because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
