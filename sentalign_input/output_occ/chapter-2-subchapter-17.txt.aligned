Chapter XVII.	CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.	0.7256993
On the incision of alguazardenic and of what grows from flesh attached in the eye.	On cutting for chemosis and superfluous flesh in the eye.	0.58762205
Sometimes in the eyes of some people, red flesh grows and covers the pupil, or it approaches or presses on the eyelids and firmly closes the eyelids from the outside and resembles a pomegranate flower.	Sometimes in the eye of certain people a red granulation grows up and increases so as to block the pupil or nearly so; or it grows over the eyelids and often turns the lids outward, and it resembles the blossom of the pomegranate.	0.8662138
But the operation is that the patient places their head on your lap; then you open their eyes and gather all that flesh with appropriate hooks, hold it with a forceps or tweezers; then cut the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished with a knife, and be careful not to damage the eye during the operation.	You operate for this by having the patient put his head in your lap; then he opens his eyes and you gather up the granulation whole, with suitable hooks, or hold it with tweezers or forceps. Then you cut away the first bit of flesh and then the next, until you have cut it all away; and beware of damaging the eye in the course of operation.	0.8801067
And let your incision with which you cut be done either with the fine instrument we mentioned in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors which are adapted according to the form of what is described in this chapter.	Your incision should be made with the scalpel which we described for the incision of pterygium; or with small scissors like those with which one gathers up pannus, as shown in the chapter after this.	0.7831836
Then, when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, fill the eye with crushed salt, or drip into it red powder similar to corrosive medicines, and place cotton soaked in egg white over the eye until it is safe from ulceration.	And when you have finished your incision and removed all the chemosis, fill the eye with powdered salt or instil the red powder or similar corrosive; and apply to the outside of the eye cotton wool with white of egg to ward off an abscess.	0.83982253
If there remains any cause of alguazardenic and you fear a serious ulcer, leave the eye and treat the ulcer with what heals that ulcer, then repeat the operation until it is healed, and similarly treat the flesh attached to the eye of this kind.	If there is any chemosis left and blood is getting the better of you and you fear an abscess, then desist and treat the eye with those means for settling a tumour. Thereafter return to your operation till cured. So must you do with superfluous flesh that arises in the eye.	0.72156686
However, you must avoid any treatment of the delicate eye either naturally or accidentally with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the part can endure that operation.	But you must avoid treating surgically any eye that is weak, whether congenitally or by acquired disease. Never set your hand to an operation of this kind till you have seen if the organ can endure such an operation.	0.82446134
