O, son, since I have completed for you this book, which is the last on the science of medicine, by its completion its purpose is achieved, and through its expositions and declarations, it seems to me appropriate that I complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the practice with the hand, that is surgery.
For the practice with the hand [surgery] is neglected in our region and in our time completely abandoned, so that its knowledge will soon be lost, and its vestige removed; and nothing will remain of it but a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which will mislead the hands and lead those [who practice it] into error and hesitation, so that its meanings are obscured and its strength and art diminished.
And it seems to me appropriate that I revive it [surgery] with the organization of this treatise, according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and that it comes with the forms of cautery instruments and other instruments of the work, as well as the addition of the explanation, and its preparation, which is necessary.
But the reason why no good craftsman with his hand [skilled surgeon] is found in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and its practitioner must first be trained in the science of anatomy, which includes knowing the positions of the limbs and their shapes, and their connection and separation from each other; and have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their origin; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the locations of their exits.
And for this reason Hippocrates said that with one name there is much [said], but in practice little, and especially in the art of the hand [surgery].
But we have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy, it is unavoidable that they will fall into error, by which men will die, just as I have seen many of them, because some are instructed in this science and throw themselves into it without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish and ignorant physician incise a scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and cut some arteries of the neck so that much blood flowed until the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who intended to extract a stone from a man which had developed in his age, and the stone was large, and he came to him and pulled out that stone with a piece of the bladder, so that the man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I realized that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and it happened to a black eunuch who had a fracture in his thigh; and the physician, in his ignorance, prepared the fracture, on the wound, with cushions and splints with strong tightening, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he untied it according to his wishes, and then he re-bandaged it, and then he left it for some days and ordered us to untie the bandage; and it remained thus until the thigh and foot were abscessed, and it resulted in ruin/loss (of the limb).
And I was called to him, and I prepared to loosen the bandage, and tranquility was achieved, and thus his pains lessened.
But however, corruption was already established in the limb, so I could not restrain it, and the corruption in the limb did not cease spreading until the patient perished/died.
And I saw another physician who lanced a cancerous abscess, and it ulcerated for some days, until its malignancy was magnified with its host/patient.
The reason for this is that since cancer is caused by pure melancholic humor, it is not appropriate that it be touched with an iron instrument at all, unless it is in a limb that can be entirely removed.
And therefore, my son, it is necessary for you that the operation with my hand be divided into two parts: that is, into an operation with which health is associated, and into a work with which there is danger in the most serious cases.
And I have already explained this in every place in this book where there is an operation in which there is error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to heed this and abandon that, so that fools do not find a way to criticize and dishonor you.
And so take up your work with care and with God's protection, and [treat] your patients with success and with confidence.
And proceed in the best way, by the grace of God leading to health and laudable success, and leave aside the terrible diseases of difficult healing, and withdraw your efforts from that which makes you afraid, so that hesitation in your faith and in your reputation does not escape you: for more will remain to your glory, and later on high in the world and behind, to your holiness.
As Gualia already said in some of his admonitions: Do not treat a bad/severe disease, so that you are not called a bad doctor.
And I have already divided this book according to three chapters.
Here begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter discusses (is arranged/ordered) from the head to the feet, the shapes of the instruments and the cautery irons, and what is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on drying and perforation, cupping, wounds, and extraction of arrows and similar things, all categorized and ordered by the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of sprains and similar things; a chapter arranged from the head to the feet, and on the forms of the instruments.
It is fitting that I describe the qualities of the benefits of this cautery and its harms, and in which complexion cautery is prohibited.
Therefore, I say that the discussion of the quality of the benefit of cautery and its harm is a long and lengthy discussion, and subtle in terms of knowledge, and a hidden secret; and a great multitude of wise men have already spoken about it, and they have disagreed about it, and a little of their discussions is enough for me, fearing lengthiness.
And so I say that you may perform cautery on every complexion universally, whether it has matter or not, except for two complexions, which are hot complexions without matter.
Regarding the hot and dry complexion with matter, they disagreed; for some said that cautery is beneficial to it, and others said the contrary, that cautery is not suitable in an illness which is characterized by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness be healed with something that is hot and dry.
And whoever says the opposite of this claims that cautery is beneficial in every hot and dry illness that occurs in the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of a man and his humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
And I say, regarding his statement, that experience has already revealed this to me several times.
But still, it is not appropriate for someone to attempt this who has not already been tested and practiced in the chapter on cautery by past practice, and who has not learned about the diversity of men's complexions and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and their causes, and their accompanying symptoms, and the duration of their time.
But in other complexions, there is no fear for you, and especially in cold and humid illnesses, for all doctors agree on these, and they are not in disagreement on the benefits of cautery in those cases.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its advantage over cautery with burning medicine, is because fire is simple, the action of which only reaches the part that is cauterized and does not harm the other parts connected to it, except with little harm/side effects.
But the action of burning medicine reaches the other parts distant from it, and very easily brings about an illness in the body that is difficult to heal and occurs very quickly.
But fire, due to its sublime nature and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, but only removes excess.  And it is already known to us through experiment and lengthy service of study in the art concerning the truth of these matters; and therefore I am excused for the length of this discussion. And if it were not forbidden for me to include in this book a secret hidden from you about fire, and the nature of its operation within bodies and its expulsion by which it expels illnesses, with philosophical demonstration, which would be burdensome to your minds...
And know, sons, that they (doctors/people) disagree about the time in which it is appropriate to perform cautery and suggest the best time is spring.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, because the harm caused by the timing of it is outweighed by the benefit that is obtained with the cautery, and especially if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, strong and sudden, which do not allow delay because it is feared that from them will come a worse problem, which is greater than the small harm introduced by the timing.
And do not hold in your minds, oh sons, this thing that only the common people and foolish doctors believe, which is that there is not always a recurrence of the illness that is healed by cautery, and they posit this as a consequence.
And the reason is not at all as they think it is, for cautery is nothing but a medicine which alters the constitution and dries the humors which are the cause from which the pains come.
But nevertheless, cautery surpasses medicine by the speed of its effectiveness and the power of its action and the greatness of its master (God/physician).
And it is possible that their illness will return at some point in time, depending on the patient's constitution and the location of their illness, and their strength, and what is prepared in their body from the aggregation of superfluities within them, and what has happened to them in their acquisition of food and similar such causes; but if the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a part with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth for pain and similar things, it is possible that the pain will not return to them, but this happens in only a few cases.
And it is common talk that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and it is a true statement, but not in the way they understand it, for they believe that there is no cure that benefits with medicine or any other thing after cautery.
And the reason is contrary to this; and the understanding that cauteri is the last remedy of medicine is only when we administer the methods of treatment in some diseases, and those medicines are not effective, and then at the end of the matter one administers cautery, and it benefits the condition. And from this it appears that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding which the common people and many foolish doctors have.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they said this only because of the evenness of gold and the sublimity/purity of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not develop an ulcer/inflammation, which is not entirely true, for I have already tested this and have found that it does not do this except in some bodies but not others, and cautery with it (gold) is good and better than with iron, just as they said; but however when you cauterize with fire with gold, it is not clear to you, for it is born/created according to the amount that you want by the redness of the gold, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you add ignition onto it, the gold melts by the fire, and some flakes fall into the fire, by which the artisan sees through the work/occupation of that.
And therefore cautery is done with iron by us more easily and more appropriately to the correctness of the operation.
And I have already arranged this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have arranged them from the head to the feet, so that the inquirer may find there what he wants.
The first chapter.
This cauterization is applied for coldness and wetness/humidity affecting the brain, from which arise two things:  a runny nose, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and excessive sleep, toothache, and throat pain, and generally every illness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, lethargy and apoplexy, and similar ailments.
The method of this cauterization is as follows: first, order the patient to be purged with a laxative medicine that cleanses the head, for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient and their age and habit.
And then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then have him sit between your hands on a square bench and place his hands on his feet.
And then place the root of your palm near the thumb upon the bridge of his nose, between his eyes. But, however, when your middle finger has reached [a certain spot], mark that place with ink, and then burn it with an olive-shaped cautery, of which this is the form:
And then place it upon the spot marked with ink, in such a way that it descends, with which your hand should be constricted little by little, and you should turn it.
And then lift your hand lightly and examine the place, and if you see that some amount of the skull bone, about the size of a chickpea, has been exposed, then raise your hand; and if not, return your hand with that iron, or with another one if it has cooled, until you see as much bone exposed as I have told you.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the spot and leave it for three days.
And then place upon it cotton soaked in pus/discharge and leave it there until the burn scab is destroyed/falls off. And then treat the area with tetrapharmacon ointment until it is healed.
And they already said that when the wound remains open, the pus/discharge drains better, because it is better and more helpful/beneficial.
And some of them said that the nape of the neck should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the surface of the bone is burned.
And then what is burned of the bone should be scraped, and then it should be treated/dressed.
And others said that with the cautery one should reach the back, until it presses strongly on the bone until the bone decays/breaks down, and this is the form of a small incision/cauterization: And they believe that the vapors of the head escape from that place.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then treated/dressed until it is healed/closed.
But these two types of cautery have not been seen by me at all, except in some men by way of fear/as a frightening method; and leaving that (method), believe me, it is better with health, when it exists; for the head is weakened by the breaking of its continuity in this way as we have testified in other limbs, and even more so when the patient's head is of a cold nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and I use that one and with that one I work with/for health.
Chapter Two.
Of cauterization of the head. /  Concerning cauterization of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs in the whole head and this is protracted in the patient, and (he) uses leeches and cupping glasses and head purges and plasters and poultices and puppies and chickens and similar things, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery which we describe and none of those things benefits him, then consider whether the patient's head is of a strong constitution in its nature; and it is not cold, and finds much great cold, then cauterize that (head) with another cautery a little below the first one. And then cauterize that (area) above the crown of his head with a cautery until the skin is broken/split. Incise the skin and uncover the bone to the extent we have described, and cauterize that with a cautery on the back part of the head in the place which is called the vessel/cavity -- and this is the place where cupping glasses are placed. And ease your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, because the patient by this finds/experiences very great pain, different from the pain of all other cauterizations of the head.
And I will describe this cautery in its place, for the cautery with which the temples and the occiput are cauterized must be a more subtle/fine/thin cautery than the one with which the middle of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Chapter three.
On cauterization for a recent migraine (literally: non-ancient migraine).
When a dull pain occurs in a part of the head, or a widespread pain reaching into the eye, let the head be evacuated with cleansing medicines, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have described in the sections on illnesses; and if all is of no avail, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is this: that you take a clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends on both sides. And then incise the site of the pain on the temple with a broad lancet until a space is made there for the clove of garlic, so that it can be hidden there.
And then press on it firmly with a compress for downward restriction, and leave it for the space of three hours; then untie it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then place over it a pad soaked in butter until the place scars.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron is done in this manner: heat with a cautery, of which this is the shape:
and it is called a nail cautery, because its head is shaped like a nail, which has some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small prominence.
And then place it on the area of pain, and hold your hand there - so the bandaging underneath is not burned - and rotate the iron little by little, with speed.
And if the amount burned reaches the depth of the skin, so that half of it [the skin] is [burned], lift your hand so that the artery underneath is not burned, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area, and leave it there for three days; and then place cotton soaked in pus [likely a typo and should be "butter"], and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of a knife as a cautery, and beware of incising an artery in this migraine, particularly in the ancient way.
Chapter Four.
On cauterization of an ancient migraine.
When you treat a migraine with what we have said about the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the sections on diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and you see by the illness that what we have said about the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire is not sufficient for him, then it is necessary that you heat the knife-cautery until it is white-hot, then you mark on the place of the pain with a line the length of which is half the length of the finger, or about that; and place your hand down once and press it until you incise the artery [possibly scalp/skin is meant, not artery] and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be aware of the continuation of the mandible, which is moved during chewing, and that the muscle is not damaged nor the nerve which moves it, and that spasm does not occur.
And be on guard and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery that is cut, because there is danger in cutting it, and especially for the one who is ignorant of what he is doing and is not studious and experienced; and ceases the operation there at the beginning.
And I will make a reminder about the management of blood flow arising from the artery according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if you see with this disease that this cautery is not enough and you see the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we discussed in the chapter on narrowing of the artery with a cautery having two blades, and this cauterization is better and more appropriate.
Chapter 5.
On cauterization for earaches.  (or,  Of the cauterization of ear pains.)
When pain comes to the ear due to cold and it is treated with laxative remedies and with the other treatment which I mentioned in the section/chapter, and the pain is not removed, then heat the cautery, and this is the one called "puncta," of which this is the form/shape:
And then, near the ignition/heating, apply the "puncta" around the entire ear as a wheel is turned, or around each temple if the pain is in each one. Slowly move the cautery along the root of the ear after you have marked the location with ink/dye. (Or "a probe")
And if you cauterize with the "puncta" ten points on the whole ear and cauterize it, then treat the spots until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
On the cauterization of "turtura" (likely a medical condition, perhaps "torticollis" or "stiff neck," given the context).  It could also refer to a "turtledove," potentially suggesting a specific remedy or anatomical analogy.
Turtura," which is treated with cauterization, is simply one of the conditions that comes from phlegm, as we have said in the sections on diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that kind of "turtura" with irons (surgical instruments) and head purges and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: the first behind the root of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third near the joining of the two lips (of the wound/affected area - context suggests the back of the neck).
And place your cautery opposite the diseased part, because softening (of the tissues/reduction of the condition) will only occur in the part that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is that you cauterize him with the cautery directly at the extremity of the ear then a little higher above the crown of the head, and another on the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the little finger, and leave your hand with the cautery until an amount half the thickness of a string has been burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, the form of which has been described previously. But however, it is more subtle than that one, a little like you see; and it needs to cut away any excess thickness.
And then treat the area with what has been described previously until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
On cauterization for chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment is ineffective and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries: on all the corners of his head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the neck/nape of the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as described above.
And cauterize also above the pit of the stomach; and further back as well; and then let him be treated with the appropriate procedure.
Chapter 8.
On cauterization for forgetfulness/loss of memory caused by phlegm/inflammation.
It is fitting that at the beginning the patient be given large electuaries (thick medicinal pastes/drinks) and brain-cleansing pills.
And then shave the patient's entire head and apply on the nape of their neck the plaster of citrus described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply this several times, for this is a type of cautery. And do this following the same method which I have already described.
And so, if he is healed by these, good; and if not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which should descend from the highest part of the head down to the lowest part of the neck. And leave a space between each cautery the width of a finger, and then treat the cautery with what has been explained previously.
But if you want an addition and the patient can tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle area; and if you want a greater addition, then cauterize on the two temples.
Then treat it until it is healed; and the cautery should be olive-shaped according to the form previously given.
Chapter 9.
On Cauterization for Paralysis and Softening of the Whole Body.
It is fitting that you proceed with cleansing of the head with jars and with what we have said; then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with cauteries on all the temples of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body, when it is excessive and the patients tolerate it and the disease is strong, then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery until it is burned from his tailbone a lot, and lift your hand. And then treat him until he is healed, and this should be an olive-shaped cautery.
Chapter 10.
On Cauterization for Epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
And thus you must cleanse his brain at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatments which we have mentioned in the section when the disease is severe and the patient can tolerate the strong medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate the medicines, then administer gargles and masticatories that cleanse the brain, before this for many days, with beneficial foods.
And then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the preceding method, and with another cautery on the occiput (back of the head), and cauterize on each "horn"/temple of the head. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I have mentioned, for paralysis and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped as was previously mentioned/described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a subtle/fine cautery in this manner.
Chapter 11.
On cauterization for melancholia.  (or "Of the cauterization of melancholy")
When the causes of melancholia are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries that we have described in the section on paralysis.  (Alternatively, "...in the chapter having to do with paralysis.")
And if the cause of melancholia is superfluity declining into melancholia, and the patient's body is humid/moist, then give him to drink that which cleanses his brain, according to what has preceded in the division/chapter. (The word "division" could also refer to a section or part of the treatise.)
And then shave the patient's head, and then make a decent-sized hole (or "fontanel", or possibly a kind of seton) on him over the crown, and then locate/place it in the middle of the head.  ("tortora" is a tricky word here, context suggests a surgical opening.)
And the patient should be sitting upright and be held on all sides / supported all around.
And then apply an ointment; and old sheep dung is most suitable for this.  (The term "pus digne" literally means "more worthy" but effectively translates to "most suitable" in this context). And warm it over the fire with moderate heat, to a temperature which the said (patient) can tolerate when it is placed on him. And then pour it in the middle of his head, within the circular area (previously prepared), and leave it there until it has cooled.
And do this with the patient once a week, along with the other treatments, until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize him by making small points according to his illness, but hold your hand with a cautery arranged thusly: this is the kind of cautery which moistens the brain evenly.
And then apply this dressing soaked in dung or chicken fat.
Chapter .xii. (or Chapter 12)
On cauterization for water descending into the eye. (or ...for watery eyes.)
When the onset of watery eyes has been revealed to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division (section/chapter), then begin and give the patient to drink that which cleanses his head, and keep him from all humidity/moisture.
And have him sweat in a bath properly for some days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize him with two cauteries on both temples if it is the beginning of a flow of water in both eyes, or on one side if it is the beginning of the water in one eye.
Incise with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are below the nape of the neck; and let the cauteries be at that distance across the width of the temples.
And beware of blood flow when cauterizing; and if you see blood flow from him, stop it with any medicine that you can.
And I will come with knowledge which is in the extraction of arteries and with their abscission (removal/cutting) and the precaution against blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck below the two bones with two cauteries produced/placed posteriorly/at the back.
Chapter .xiii. (Thirteen)
On the cauterization of old tears/lachrymal ducts (or possibly old wounds/ulcers).
When tears/discharge from the eyes are chronically present, and it is verified that this is due to cold phlegmatic superfluities through the veins and arteries which are in the obvious/exposed place of the head, then cauterize that with the cautery which we recounted in the chapter on the commencement of water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery on the middle place of the head and with two cauteries on the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries on the neck below the two bones. And if you need addition (further treatment), then cauterize that on all sides of the corner of the eye on the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter .xiv. (Fourteen)
On the cauterization of foul odor of the nose.
When you treat that with what we have said in the division/section and your treatment is not effective, then you prepare and give the patient cochia pills to drink for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize it with a middling cautery with an olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize him with a clove-shaped cautery with two cauterizations above both eyebrows, leaving the hairs a little bit. (i.e., leaving some hair.)
And beware of the artery so that you do not burn it.
And of the clove-shaped cautery, this is the form/shape.
Chapter 15.
On cauterization for softening of the eyelids/eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or by moisture/humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar caustic; and this is its form/shape:
And you, cauterize a little above both eyebrows with two cauteries on each side, and let them be distant from the temples. And let the length of each cauterization be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand too hard with the cautery, but only enough so that a third of the eyelid is burned/cauterized.
Chapter 16.
On cauterization of the eyelid when the eyelashes turn inwards and prick the eye.
When the eyelashes turn inwards so that they prick the eye, cauterization is done in two ways: either with iron or with a burning medicine.
If cauterizing with fire, first instruct the patient to let their eyelashes grow, like those who are cleaning them, until they are long and even; and if it pricks him above their origin, then you bind his eyes with a bandage so that he doesn't move until the lashes have grown.
Then when they are grown and even, place the patient's head on your lap, and then mark on his eyelid with ink, a mark in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and the beginning of the mark should be near the lashes.
And then place cotton soaked in egg white or psyllium mucilage over the eye.
And then ignite the cautery, of which this is the form.
And then cauterize over the figure which you have marked, little by little, in many passes, until the surface of the skin, which is like a myrtle leaf, is completely and visibly burned.
And a sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the lashes raised away from the puncture of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with an ointment on it until the scar is healed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if something returns through the lashes near their roots and the eyelid is softened, then cauterize it again just as you did the first time.
But if the lashes are on the eyelid below, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is levelled and the lashes don't prick the eye.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is this: you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, and then a shape of a myrtle leaf is made from a piece of cloth.
And then take one ounce of known soap and one ounce of quicklime or something similar, and then mix these things well, and do this quickly so that it doesn't cool; and then spread this on the cloth which is shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place it over one or both eyes; and place cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head should be in your lap.
And put the said (cotton/cloth) on the medicine and press it a little and don't remove it until the patient feels the medicine's bite, for its bite is like fire.
And when (the patient) perceives this, that he feels the bite, then remove the medicine and wipe it with your finger; when the burning stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then examine if you see the eyelid is already lifted.  If it is lifted, treat the scar with fire or by incision, for then it is well; and if not, return the medicine to the place where the medicine hasn't yet taken effect and don't hesitate until your work is even and the eye is corrected.
And then place cotton with an ointment on it until the burned area's eschar is removed, and then treat it with eye ointment or another (ointment) until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, after your operation, that you watch with vigilant diligence that none of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid after a few days softens and some part of it falls into the eye, then repeat your treatment on the softened part of the eyelid, just as you did at the beginning, and then surround it (the eye, presumably with cotton/ointment) until it is healed.
And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And know that people's eyes are diverse in size, both large and small, and therefore your surgical repair should be done accordingly.
And the path of correctness will not be hidden from the one who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
On cauterization of a fistula that is in the lacrimal duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the sections on diseases and your treatment is not effective, then you must cauterize it in this manner: order the patient to place their head on your lap, and have an assistant hold their head between your hands in such a way that it is not moved or agitated.
And then place cotton soaked in egg white or psyllium mucilage over their eye.
And then heat the cautery, which has this shape:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's feather, at one end with which the cauterization is done.
And if you wish, it can be penetrating to the other end. And if you want, it can come out like a tent/probe.  (The word "tenta" could mean a tent, or more likely in this surgical context, a probe or director.)
But however, the one that is concave is better for your work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and draw blood from it and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
And then place the cautery, which should be well heated, over it, and hold your hand a little above the cautery from the eye to the area of the nose, so that your hand does not err or the patient be disturbed, and then place the cautery in the fat of the eye socket and cauterize it.
And so, if at the beginning of your cauterization, it reaches the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then place cotton with ointment on it and around it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if eleven days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and scraped as appropriate, as described in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some first described: cut into the location of the fistula and split it open, and then insert into that fissure a thin cannula which is shaped to fit; and pour into it the quantity of one ounce of molten lead; and hold your hand with the cannula firmly, and do not let the patient move so that the molten lead does not reach his eye; and you must place cotton soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye, for lead adheres to the site of the fistula and heals it with wondrous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about cauterization and treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a passage through the nose and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose as will come in its proper place.
Chapter 18.
On cauterization of the fissure of the eyelids. (Or, more literally:  Of the cauterization of the crack/split of the eyelids.)
Many times fissures occur on the lips, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures with what we have said in the sections (or divisions) and your treatment is not effective, then heat the small knife-shaped cautery according to this form which follows:
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then place it carefully and gently within those fissures until the cautery reaches the depth/bottom of the fissures.
And then treat that with ointments/plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
On cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula or in the palate or in the roots of the teeth an abscess develops, and then forms an arm (sinus tract), and then ruptures, and then becomes chronic, and discharges pus and becomes a fistula, and then you treat it and the treatment is ineffective, then you must heat a cautery according to the size that can be received in the fistula, and then place that heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand steady until the heated iron reaches its bottom, and do this once or twice; and then treat it with what we have said about the treatment until it is healed.
And so if the diseased tissue is cut out and it heals, good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone as it will come in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
On cauterization of the teeth and softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and it is ineffective, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat a cautery, the shape of which will come later, so that you place the cannula over the tooth and insert the heated cautery into it quickly, and hold your hand steady a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire reach the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cautery a few times as you wish.
And then the patient rinses their mouth with salt water and holds it for an hour, and then spits it out, because the loose tooth is strengthened and the softened gum is tightened and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Chapter 21.
On cauterization for toothache.
When toothache is due to cold, or there is a cold or worm in it, or you cannot effect a cure with medicine, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterize with cow dung, or cauterize with fire.
Cauterization with dung is done by taking cow dung and boiling it in an iron pot, and then taking cotton and wrapping it around the end of a probe, and then dipping it in the boiled dung, and placing it quickly on the aching tooth before it cools.
And then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cotton in the aforementioned dung, and place it on the aching tooth, and then place a hot iron on it until the iron reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
But cauterization with fire is that you should use a small tube of brass or iron, and let it have some thickness in its center so that the sharpness/intensity of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
And then heat the cautery, the shape of which will come [is appropriate - contextually implied], and place it on the tooth and keep your hand there until the cautery cools; and do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, after the application of the cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good dung and hold it for an hour and then spit it out; and this is the manner of cauterization.
And cauterize with whichever extremity you wish, as best you can.
And this is the form of the cannula/tube:
Chapter 22.
On the cauterization of extrophulos/protrusions (likely referring to hemorrhoids).
When protrusions/extrophulos are caused by phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to digestion by medicines, and you desire their gentle digestion, then you should heat a hollow cautery, the form of which is as follows, having two open ends so that the smoke may escape from the cautery through the other end, and place the heated cautery on the swelling/abscess once, and again if needed, until it reaches the core/depth of the swelling/abscess.
And if the swelling/abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the swelling/abscess, and then leave it for three days and place upon it cotton soaked in butter/ointment until what the fire has burned is removed.
And then treat it with ointment, bandages/compresses, and cloths until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
On cauterization of hoarseness of voice and constriction of breath/windpipe.
When humors come upon the canal of the lung, and especially when this is accompanied by coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and afterwards cauterize him/her behind the root of the throat in the depressed/affected area.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor burn his uvula/throat, but only a little.
And cauterize him/her with another cautery behind the joint of the neck on his/her last vertebra.  (Could also mean lowest vertebra - context unclear) And his/her cautery should be nail-shaped according to the preceding method.
And then treat him/her with what was described previously until he/she is healed.
Chapter 24.
On cauterization for lung disease and cough.
When a cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors, and the patient does not have a fever or phthisis (tuberculosis), and it is a chronic illness, then cauterize him/her with two cauteries above the furcula (collarbone) in the depressed areas along the length and width; and with another cautery in the middle of the feet between the two ankle bones (malleoli); and the cautery should be nail-shaped according to the preceding method.
And if you wish, perform your cauterization by puncturing with the cautery that is called "puncta," the form of which was described previously in the section on cauterization for ear pain.
And the punctures should be between each one (of the cauterizations? Perhaps referring to multiple punctures in the locations already mentioned); and afterwards treat him/her with the same medicine that was previously described until he/she is healed.
And the cautery should have three prongs because the cauterization is done with it: with one application, you can make three cauteries in this manner:
Chapter 25.
On cauterization of the uvula, which is the tip of the little tongue (or soft palate).
When the tip of the uvula is dislocated because of slippery humors and is not stabilized at the time of its return from its dislocation until it is accustomed to returning to its place, and then by a small movement it is dislocated again so that it happens, as we have witnessed, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be turned over on their back or on their left side; and then lift the uvula which is on the inner part of the soft palate to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated to the inner parts.
And then heat the cautery having two points; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the uvula until it penetrates to the other side; and the figure of the cauterization will then have four cauterized points.
And sometimes it is arranged according to this count and for that reason there are eight cauterizations.
And then place cooked leeks with salt on the cauterization, and then have the patient lie still, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is strengthened/healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a nail-shaped cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
On cauterization of the stomach.
When coldness and much moisture comes into the stomach, so that it deviates from its normal complexion and those [cold and moist humors] multiply and remain within it, and if you continue the methods of treatment and it is not strengthened, then it is necessary that the patient lie supine on his back, and extend his arms and his thighs, and then cauterize him with three cauteries: with one cautery under the feet by the length of a finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and with two cauteries on both sides of the cautery, so that a triangular cauterization pattern results; and keep them separated so that they are not touching, which would cause putrefaction/infection.
And the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And the shape of the cautery should be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery in the shape of a circle according to this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized by puncturing in someone who is afraid of this cautery [the large circular one]: that is, you mark points on the stomach as many as you want with a probe, and then cauterize it at those points with a cautery; and then treat it with the aforementioned treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On cauterization of a cold liver.
When pain occurs in the liver due to coldness or humidity or excessive wind, such that its normal complexion is thrown off by superfluous discharge, and the patient is treated with what we have said and does not recover, then the patient should lie on their back, with their neck raised, and you mark with a probe three cauteries in this form and this same size on the liver below the hypochondria, where one can perceive the lying position of the person.
And let the space between each cautery be the width of a finger, and let the cautery [mark/incision] be the length of a straight body [of a date pit, according to other texts].
And do not press your hand heavily with the cautery.
And if the amount [of burnt flesh] that is adhered is half the size/thickness of a hazelnut shell, then add no more; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if not standing, then they should be lying down, with their thighs extended and their arms raised.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these [points] with a bladed cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to go too deep in the cauterization, only burn as much as a hazelnut shell’s thickness,  so that the entire area is cauterized and [the heat] reaches the intestines, because the shell is thin there; and know this.
Chapter 28.
On the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When a growth or abscess occurs in the liver and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will find [it] heavy and the pain will be sharp.
And if it is in the membrane of the liver, the pain will be very sharp and sometimes it even tires the physicians who treat it.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient be turned on his neck/back; then probe the location of the abscess with a probe/instrument; then ignite the cautery which is shaped like a radish, the form of which has been shown in the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the diseased matter is burned, until it reaches the diaphragm, until healthy blood comes out.
And then treat it with the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And this type of cautery should only be used by one whose study in the art of medicine is extensive, and in whose hands many illnesses have been treated;  but even with experience, one should rarely be bold with this operation, but rather leave it to us [experienced physicians], and that is better.
Chapter 29.
On Cauterization of Pleurisy.
The ancients said that cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy should be done in this manner: you take one dried root of long birthwort, as long as can be found, and the thickness of a finger.
Then submerge it in oil and dry it by the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery in the place which is between the joining of the collarbone and the neck; and with two small cauteries placed below [the first cautery], angled slightly towards the area below the chin; and with two cauteries in the area sloping between the fifth and sixth ribs, angled slightly towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the foot; and with another on the stomach; and with three cauteries on the back; and with one cautery in the place between the two shoulders; and with two cauteries on the two sides of the foot, below the cautery which is between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary to squeeze your hand with the cautery, rather let it be held loosely in the hand.
And some of the ancients have said that some men use an iron cautery resembling a ray, and ignite it, and place it in the area between the ribs, until they reach the abscess with it and pus is drawn out, as we have said concerning abscess of the liver.
But this perforation with a cautery is not without danger, for one may die immediately or a fistula may develop in that place which cannot be healed.
Chapter 30.
On cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have said about its treatment in the section [on diseases] and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is done in three ways, all of which are direct, one of which is that you make three or four cauterizations in a line along the length of the spleen, following the pattern of the cauterizations of the liver, the figure of which has preceded [this chapter].
And let the space between each cauterization be the width of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cauterization be the same as we have described for the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and the patient should lie on his back.
And there is another way to cauterize, which is that you ignite the cautery having two openings, as we have described in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and lift the rib cage which is next to the spleen where it may be according to the position of the patient on their left side.
And the lifting motion with which you raise the rib cage should be along the length of the body, so that the cauterizations are made along the width of the body.
And then insert the two openings, very hot, into that space, so that with them you penetrate the rib cage from the other side.
And then remove the cautery; and thus four cauterizations are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three openings.
And then you treat the cauterized area after it has stopped emitting sparks for several days, because this is more important than the other preceding steps in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
On Cauterization for Dropsy (or Edema).
Cauterization is not used in general dropsy/edema, but only in ascites specifically.
When you treat the dropsical/edematous patient with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division/chapter and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize him/her with four cauteries around the navel and with one cautery on the stomach, and with another cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae/spine of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and with another cautery on the stomach. And the amount of depth of the cautery should be proportional to the thickness of the skin.
And then leave the cautery wound open so that it drains fluid for a long time.
And do not stop the patient's treatment soon after the cauterization with the necessary procedures, so that two intentions/purposes can be added to it, and healing will be hastened for him with assistance/help.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped according to the form of that which is described above, and the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped according to its preceding form/description.
Chapter 32.
On cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are abscessed/swollen in dropsy and are filled with serous/citrine fluid, it is necessary that you cauterize the feet on the top of the foot in the space between the little toe and the ring toe. And lift your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then lift your hand and do not remove it entirely, because the serous/citrine fluid will drain out.
The cautery is of this shape [likely refers to an accompanying image]: And then make two cauterizations on both thighs, and on each thigh the cauterization should be made with the tip of a knife-shaped cautery. And the cauterization should be along the length of the thigh: one above the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and two cauterizations on each thigh.  (So a total of four, two on each thigh).
And leave the wound open without dressing it for a long time so that any fluid may drain out of it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
On cauterization of the abdomen/belly. (Literally "body of the belly")
When the abdomen, due to cold and humidity within, weakens the faculties—namely the digestive and retentive faculties, which are in the stomach and intestines—and this is treated with the usual methods of treatment and they do not help, and sometimes the patient, tolerating cautery, shows improvement, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach as described previously in the cauterization of the stomach, with the circular cautery and with four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle nail-shaped cautery; and with a cautery on the hip over the large trochanter, or with two cauteries.
And if you sometimes see excessive humidity and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize him on the pubis and over the intestines, and very lightly apply two cauteries on the stomach and near the groins, for it is a complete curative treatment with which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
On cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When there are, in the posterior, old hemorrhoids of a nature consisting of thick cold humors or corrupted humidities, and they are treated with what we have said in the section [on hemorrhoids] and your treatment is not effective, then cauterize with three cauteries on the bone below the two small vertebrae and the small triangular one, and with a cautery above the navel down two fingers [widths].
And if you suspect that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and his face appears pale/sickly, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery as described previously; and with one cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter 35.
On cauterization for fistulas after their excision.
When you excise a fistula, then you should heat the cautery that is shaped like a spoke/ray. Then insert that heated [cautery] into the excised fistula, and guide it with your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if there are many such [fistulas], then cauterize each of them as we have described, and then treat them with the ointments you deem appropriate until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery over some area, it is slower in healing.
Chapter 36.
On cauterization of fistulas that are located in the posterior of the body in the lower parts.
When the [usual treatment/nature] doesn't respond to the procedure we have described in its place, and the patient is frightened by this, let it be treated with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the posterior, and it is old, with decaying sanies (pus) and corrupted moisture, then what is most necessary is to probe it with a thin probe, and then determine the extent of its depth with the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery that is ray-shaped (or like a spoke). And then insert this heated cautery into the fistula, according to the depth to which you inserted the probe.
And repeat [inserting] the cautery into it until the corrupted flesh is burned, either one or two or three times, according to the extent of your need.
And beware of burning a nerve or a vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine, then beware of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think it is not penetrating [deeply].
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the infected matter is cut away from it, and remains so for a long time, then know that it is already completely healed.
And if the infected matter is not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating either into the depth of the bone where it is corrupted, or that this [condition] is caused by things which will be discussed in their [proper] place.
Chapter 37.
On cauterization of the kidneys/loins. (The word "ronhos" likely refers to the lumbar region, commonly referred to as the kidneys in older medical texts.)
When pain occurs in the loins/kidneys due to cold or excessive flatulence, and because of this the patient's side is numb, then it is necessary that you cauterize him on the loins/kidneys with a cautery on each kidney/loin with a nail-shaped cautery, which was mentioned previously.
And very lightly cauterize with the second one a little below, so that there will be three cauterizations in a line, and thus they will be more helpful in healing.
Chapter 38.
On cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize him in the lowest part above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and cauterize with one cautery on his right side, and with another on his left.
And let the length of each cauterization be according to the size of the patient's finger's width; and cauterize him with a cautery on the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be nail-shaped as described previously.
Chapter 39.
On cauterization of the uterus/womb.
When coldness and humidity occur in the uterus, and therefore pregnancy is prevented, and the menses are corrupted, and their onset is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then the area should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said regarding cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the area lowest on the back, or with two cauteries, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
On cauterization for dislocation of the hip.
When mucous humidities infiltrate the hip area, and cause it to become dislocated, a sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when they are compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it bulges.
Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the area of his hip with a circular cautery, after you have marked with ink the circumference of the area as it is swollen, so that the affected part falls in the middle of the circle.
And use the cautery whose form was previously described for cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And the cauterization should be done according to the thickness of the entire swelling/growth; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On cauterization of the sciatic vein/nerve.
When pain occurs in the hip area, and it is caused by cold and humidity, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it does not help, and this treatment is outdated, then you must purge the patient of gross humors with foul-smelling pills or with artificial or similar pills; and then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization in this case is of two kinds: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
It will be according to two known methods, one of which is that you cauterize him on the area of his hip with three triangular cauteries in this way; and make a good depth with them. And let the space which is between each cautery be the amount of the thickness of a finger, whether the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes the cautery is placed over the middle part, on the head of the hip, for which there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle, the form of which is described in the cauterization for dislocation of the hip, where the circle should be continuous and burn around the thickness of the entire thigh.
And this is the manner of cautery in sciatica when the pain is located in the hip and does not extend down to the thigh.
But if it extends down to the thigh, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh over the place where the patient feels the pain; and with one cautery on the ankle about four fingers below the outside part.
And if you use a knife-shaped cautery, the depth of the cauterization should be according to the thickness of the thigh.
And if the patient feels that the pain extends down to the area near the toes, then cauterize him there where he feels it with a cautery, making three points or four or more if needed.
And if the patient feels pain below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize him there with a knife-shaped cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations not to go so deep with the cautery that you burn a nerve or a large artery, and thereby cause the patient harm or contraction.
And I have seen some of those who cauterized on the ankle and went too deep in the cauterization, and the leg became so swollen that the swelling reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted. And then severe diarrhea occurred, and soon after, death.
And if the pain is in two places together, cauterize each one according to this method.
And some wise men have said regarding cauterization of the hip, a cautery of which this is the manner: make a circle of iron, the circumference of which is half a palm; and let its opening be the size of a date pit or a little less.
And inside that circle let there be another third; and let the space between them be the size of a finger joint; and let these circles be open in two places; and let the length of these cases be a joint or two joints, and make in them an iron mark decently fitted within the circles; and this is its form/shape:
Then it should be heated in the fire until it glows red and emits sparks, and then it should be placed on the part of the hip, with the patient lying on their healthy side. And then cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
And then leave it for three days; then plaster it with a poultice and leave the wound open for many days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Albucasis says: Oh, sons, we have used this type of cautery little because of the fear of its appearance, and because we have found few who look upon it.
But it is among the best cauteries for those who have tolerated it, and it finds its place with them.
But cautery with burning medicines is when you make two circles having a perforated handle in which they hold the bolt of the iron door; let the length of the walls in their height be two nuts or about that.
And let the space between each one be the width of a finger; and let them be open below and above, and let them contain themselves between each other in this manner:
Then place it on the part of the hip [with] the patient lying on his side, and press your hand on the part of the hip; then take hot water and pour it between the two circles, and let its quality be with the fire little by little, and keep it [there] for the amount of one hour, and let the patient endure the biting and the burning of it — for it produces a biting like that of fire — until the biting ceases.
Then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe the hot water from the whole hip with fresh water.
And then leave it for three days and place lint on it until the blackness of the burn is removed, and leave it for some days, and pus will run from it; this is latest in improvement/healing.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends into the thigh or the leg, make him a bath in which he soaks in water just as is done in the hip bath likewise.
And this is the method of the hot water bath, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the correction of medicines. Take one part each of alkali and unslaked lime, crush them and place them in a new pot, the bottom of which should be perforated by a small hole, according to the size of the ray (fish?). / according to the amount that fits within the ray.  (This line is tricky -  "ray" could refer to a fish, a beam of light, a measurement, or something else. Context might help clarify.)
And place another glazed pot beneath the bottom of the first pot, and pour fresh water over the alkali and quicklime, covering them by a finger's breadth. Then compress these with your hand, pressing firmly, and let the pot drip the sharp water into the glazed pot below.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over more fresh quicklime and alkali, for it will then become very strongly acrid, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterizing other limbs, because it acts like fire.
And there are some medicines with which a burn may also be cauterized, such as Armenian wormwood, anacardic honey (or cashew honey), and lime with soap, mixed together.
And Galien recounts the operation and treatment of an ancient man with which pain of the hip and sciatic nerve is cured, and highly praises its effectiveness, saying that no other treatment is needed, and that it is healed by a single application, as he relates, because the man entered a bath very quickly, and thus was already cured of it.
And take fresh spurge, and if fresh is not found, take a fresh fig; and mash it well with a little grease and place it on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and bind it.
And leave it for the duration of three hours or for the amount of time that the patient feels relief from the burning sensation.
And then place him in a bath, and when his body is reddened, place him in the sun, because the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that one should not use a cautery with these medicines except after the bowels have been evacuated.
But, Escorides [Dioscorides] said that when the styptic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it benefits the patient; and the cautery should be with it in this manner: take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it between the arch of the foot and the ankle.
And then take dry goat dung and ignite it with fire until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is extinguished. And then repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of the burning reaches the hip and the pain subsides.
And this type of cautery is called cautery of cows (or cautery of oxen).
Chapter 42.
On cauterization for back pain.
Sometimes pain is in the back from several causes, such as a fall or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and from similar causes, by the influx of cold and moist matter.
And cautery is not appropriate except in this one type, which is caused by an outpouring of cold material (or humor).
Therefore, after purging the patient with fetid pills and the like, it is necessary to make three lines along the width of the back where the pain is located, then mark with ink where to apply five or more cauteries on each line, according to the patient's tolerance and strength.
And the cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries of a medium nail shape, in this way:
Chapter 43.
On cauterization at the beginning of kyphosis/humpback. (Gilbositat likely refers to a hump or curvature of the spine.)
This disease often happens to young children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it occurs with tightness in the spine along with elevation and movement (of the spine/back).
And you will find on the last vertebra of the back and its joints that it already begins to protrude over the other vertebrae.
And so when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this shape: The cautery should cover the entire part of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize two or three lines in the circumference of the vertebra with the pointed cautery. And let the points be close to each other.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But be careful that cautery is not administered on a swelling caused by a nerve spasm.
Chapter 44.
On cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pains are caused by cold humors, which infiltrate every part of the body, then when pain comes to the feet, it is customary for doctors to call this gout specifically/properly.
And so when gout is treated as a cold ailment with the appropriate methods and the pains do not subside, then cautery remains (as a treatment option).
And you should cauterize (the patient) near the evacuation point in the area around the foot joint with many cauterizations.
And it should be an olive-shaped cautery, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary that points be made on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise up to the knees or other joints, and this happens many times, then cauterize the patient on each painful spot with three or four cauterizations on all sides with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if you need many cauterizations, then cauterize the area but don't press your hand too hard with the cautery; rather, [the burn] should only be about the thickness of a string/cord.
And if the pains rise up into one or two knees, then administer the cautery which we have discussed in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called chiragra/gout of the hand, then puncture around the wrists as they turn, puncture in those two lines.
And if pain remains in the said fingers, then puncture around the wrists on each knuckle and on the back of the hand.
And if the pains rise after a few days to the elbows or the muscles, then cauterize each of these with the aid of assistance [i.e., helpers/instruments].
And do not neglect the patient's good regimen and the taking of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and phlegm is evacuated with this cautery, they will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On cauterization of ruptures/hernias. (The word "rompeduras" suggests something broken or ruptured, thus hernias fits the surgical context.)
When a rupture occurs in the groins, with the intestines descending before the bandage to the genitals, and this is a recent onset, then you must order the patient to stop eating on that day and to use softening/laxative things so that the tear/opening in their belly descends.
And then hold the patient between your hands, supporting them on their back, and tell them to hold their breath until it is completely exhaled or the bandage or intestines appear.
And then return/replace it (the hernia/intestines) with your fingers and mark with ink the rupture above the pubic bone with a mark whose extremity should be similar to a half-circle on the upper parts of the body.
And then heat the cautery, of which this is its shape:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. And then return the intestine or the hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the place so that the intestine does not come out.
And you have already opened (the space) between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion there, and another assistant should be on his legs, and another on his chest, who holds his hands. (Or potentially "on his feet," depending on the precise meaning of "pietz," which could mean feet or chest in some medieval contexts).
And then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, with the cautery held straight, and keep it there until you reach the bone of the pubis to the middle of the finger; and repeat this another time if you have not reached the bone on the first try.
And carefully watch the protruding intestine at the time of your cauterization, so that you do not burn that intestine, lest death or other great harm come upon the patient.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation will not be successful / you will not have achieved your goal.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small according to their size and dimensions.
And then treat the cauterized area for three days with ointment until the burn scab is removed/falls off.
And then treat it with the other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the area and the wound are sealed/closed.
And it is necessary that you adjust his nourishment according to the length of his treatment, which cleanses his bowels, and so that the intestine does not protrude due to the strain of healing.
And then when he wants to get up after about forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days.
And he should be spared from work and from excess of food and drink, and from loud speech, for when he follows this regimen, he will be completely healed.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures in the other parts of the belly, and this at the beginning, and if you wish them not to recur, then cauterize that rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let that which is excised from the swelling be about a third of it; and then treat it with what we have said, and it will not return.
And some earlier [physicians] said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this manner, after it is marked with a probe:
and a line is placed across the width on the highest side of the rupture, and another line above; and place your hand with a nail-shaped cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of torsion/testicle pain. (Torcio can refer to twisting, which could relate to a hernia or testicular torsion.)
When pain occurs in any limb due to a fall or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time and you cannot achieve a cure with medicines, then it is necessary that you cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery should be applied to the whole limb according to its size, its smallness, its strength, its weakness, the location of the torsion/pain, and the degree of pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cauterization, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization; for it is customary in these pains that the limb be punctured, from that limb to the one that is near it, so it is necessary that you follow these with the cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes [treated] with cautery with very great benefit, and especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so when you want to cauterize that one, consider if the leprosy is advanced and you have treated it with what we have said in the division and it doesn't diminish, nor stop, and you fear that the corruption will take over the patient's whole body and their entire constitution, then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second a little below it, near the forehead at the hairline; and two on the temples; and one behind, on the nape of the neck.
And finally, press your hand with the cautery a little so that it makes a small impression on the bone, and the scabs are removed from it, so that the expiration of thick vapors is relieved from him; and cauterize over the spleen according to what is needed/prescribed.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears manifestly, then you must cauterize him with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheeks, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with a large one on the vertebrae near the tailbone, and one on the tailbone, and with two on the hips, and with one on each hip, and with two on the knees and one on each knee, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the muscles, and with two on the palms of his feet; and cauterize him on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of his feet, and on the wrists of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are on the heel so that you don't burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pubic bone and with another on the pit of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
And the cauteries must be large or small depending on the limbs and joints according to what was previously described regarding the types of instruments.
And then treat the cauterized area with cooked chickpea flour mixed with honey and the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On Cauterization for Numbness/Stupor.  (Or, Cauterization in the Case of Stupor)
When a limb is numb or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the limb, whether large or small.
And let your cautery penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin. (The word "codena" likely refers to skin or flesh) And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes numbness, which occurs in the hands and feet, and in the vertebrae of the back near the exits of the nerves which move that limb, is cauterized, and the numbness is removed.
But no one should presume to do this except someone who is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the paths of the nerves moving throughout the entire body.
Chapter 49.
On cauterization of morphea, which is albaras (likely a skin condition, possibly vitiligo or another form of discoloration).
When albaras (morphea) is old and you can't treat it with any medicinal ointments, then you cauterize it with a pointed cautery, lightly, according to the size of the affected skin area, until the whiteness and discoloration are removed, and its color is changed.
And then treat it with a mixture of chickpea and lentil flour, rose oil, arnica leaves, and either pigeon blood or swallow blood, one part of each all mixed together.  Then spread this on a cloth and place it on the affected area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
On the cauterization of cancer.
When a cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, just as it is circumscribed.
And the scholars said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle; but I have not seen this, for I fear it may ulcerate, and I have already seen this happen several times.
And it is more correct that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 51. (Roman numerals LI)
On the cauterization of swelling/tumor. (The word "adubilati" likely refers to a swelling, tumor, or possibly an abscess.  The "-ati" ending suggests a plural form, but the context implies a singular concept.)
When a swelling is slow in ripening/maturing, and this is due to the superfluity causing it, or due to the patient's age, because he is old and decrepit, with little blood, or because of the weather/season, and you want to hasten the ripening/maturing of the swelling; then cauterize around its circumference with many small pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten its maturation.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form/shape: and place it in the middle of the swelling until it penetrates the skin/membrane. (The word "codena" likely means skin, membrane, or a layer of tissue.)
And if the cautery [is applied] in the place that is lower/dependent, so that the arm's body may be relieved/drained; then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
On Cauterization with Corrosives/Caustics.
A corrosive/caustic is an ulcer spreading in the limb, which corrodes/eats away at it like fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosive ulcer in a place that tolerates cauterization with fire, then you should ignite small pointed cauteries, as many as is appropriate for the place where the corrosive ulcer is located.
And then cauterize it all around until you eradicate all of the corrosion and no trace of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and place over the cauterized areas a dressing soaked in mixed oil until the scabs are all removed/have fallen off along with all the infection/corrosion.
And then treat it with ointments that promote flesh/tissue growth.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh grows where there is no more infection, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on what remains in the infected places.
And a corrosive agent is sometimes medicated with a sharp/strong medicine, because that is used in place of a cautery. But nevertheless cautery with fire provides the easiest/quickest relief.
And I have already described the treatment with sharp/strong medicine in the section/chapter (on it), so take that when you need it for him/her.
Chapter 53.
On cauterization of nails and other similar (things/ailments).
Many times an ailment called a corn/nail occurs on the parts under the foot, and it is a large, deep-seated cause which hurts the foot; and cautery on these is of two kinds, that is, cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
But cautery with fire is that you heat a concave cautery similar to a vulture's feather, which should be made of iron according to the size which entirely contains the nail/corn, and it should have thin edges/margins.
And then place that heated (cautery) on the nail/corn, and then turn your hand with the cautery around the nail/corn until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail/corn. And leave that for three days until it begins to throw off/expel pus. And then plaster it with wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for it will be eradicated from its roots.
And then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it doesn't heal, and many times this happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you must administer in those (places) cautery with water, and that is that you take a small tube of copper or iron or a vulture's feather, and place it on the nail/corn; and then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube, and keep your hand (there), and you turn it with the pressure of your hand completely, and let the edge of the tube be pressed into the root of the nail/corn, and the hot water will find a way to the depth of the root of the nail/corn; and let the patient wait a bit, for the burning of the hot water for an hour, and then remove it, for the nail/corn with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this with those, and then with the next one until you come to all of them that are in the body.
And then treat them, after the roots of the nails/corns are eradicated, with those ointments which generate flesh.
Chapter 54.
On cauterization of tremor/shivering/shaking.  (Likely referring to a treatment for tremors or shivering)
When someone experiences tremors due to cold in the nerves or from a fever caused by cold, or for other similar reasons, then you must cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra with one cauterie; and with a cauterie on their feet, and on their stomach, with an olive-shaped cauterie.
And their tremor will subside and their recovery from the cold illness will hasten.
Chapter 55.
On cauterization for white spots/patches appearing on the body. ( *Albati* likely refers to some kind of skin discoloration or lesion perceived as white.)
When white spots/patches appear on the body, and there are cracked pustules which are made of gross corrupted matter; then it is necessary at the onset of their appearance, that each head of the fistula be cauterized with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, the tip of which is ignited with fire; or with the roots of long birthwort (*Aristolochia longa*); or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes cautery is also appropriate at the beginning of its expulsion in this manner; and they [the pustules/lesions?] are not believed [understood?], and the superfluity making them is broken up, and heals from them.  (This sentence is a little unclear; the meaning of "cregudas" in this context is uncertain.)
But it is necessary that this be done after evacuation by phlebotomy (blood-letting).
Chapter 56.
On cauterization of blood flow occurring from the incision of an artery.
Too often there occurs a flow from an artery that is incised below the wound which happens deeply, or from the incision of abscesses or cautery of the limb, and other similar things, and it is difficult to remedy this.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you should quickly cover the opening of the artery with your hand, and place your finger on it, pressing it strongly many times until the flow of blood is stopped beneath your finger, and so that it does not come out.
And then put in the fire several small and large olive-shaped cauteries, in great number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
And then take one of them, small or large depending on the location and the wound in which the artery is ruptured, and quickly, after you have removed your finger, apply the cautery on that vein until the blood is burned and stopped.
And if the blood spurts from the opening of the artery when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those that are prepared in the fire, and continue to do this one after the other until the blood is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that another injury comes upon the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to stop the bleeding in those, especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or by extraction when it is not extracted, because when it is extracted its ends are better cauterized and the blood is stopped, or that it be tied with thread or with a ligature by tight constriction, or that medicines whose virtue is to stop blood be placed on it; and they should be pressed with a cushion with decent constriction.
But he who administers proper constriction either with ligature and tight bandages or by applying burning substances and similar things, he won't do anything but cause delay.
But if this happens to someone and the doctor is not present nor medicine, then gently press with the index finger on the opening of that vein as we have said, and apply great pressure until the bleeding stops from the upper part of the wound, and do not remove the finger from over the artery; and sprinkle very cold water on the artery until the blood congeals and thickens; and it is better to sew than needing cautery or medicine.
Of incisions and perforations and cupping glasses and of phlebotomy (blood-letting) and of wounds and similar things.
We have already discussed in the first chapter every disease in which cauterization with fire and with burning medicine is appropriate, and the occasions and causes of it, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the top of the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the one seeking this may be helped, then, concerning that which he has asked.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that what is in this chapter is, by means of terror, that which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because great caution is required, for in the operations which are in this chapter many times there is evacuation which is with blood, with which is life, either through the opening of a vein or incision over an abscess or opening of a fistula or cleaning of a wound or extraction of an arrow or incision for a stone and things similar to them. And all of these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in the hands of many of them [i.e., practitioners], death.
And I warn you that what leads to hesitation does not fall upon you, for sometimes you will encounter people of many temperaments with many kinds of illnesses. And of these there are some who become angry about their illness, and death is insignificant to them; and this is because of the intensity of what they find from their illness, and because of the length of their illness, and with the illness there is fear, which signifies death.
And of these there is the one who gives you his possessions and says, you hoping for his recovery, and his disease is pernicious/fatal.
And therefore it is not fitting that you agree [to treat] the one who comes to you in this manner; and let your caution be greater than greed and your rapacity; and do not presume anything about this except with certain knowledge which verifies it before you, and to which follows praiseworthy success.
And in the treatment of all your patients, make use of prognosis and indications of him whose health is restored, for in that is your aid in acquiring fame and renown, praise and glory.
Oh, sons, may God inspire his understanding in you and not remove from you direction and protection, for this is in his hand.
And I have arranged this chapter, distinguishing it by sections as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the treatment of the head down to the feet, so that what you ask about and what you need may be made easier for you.
Chapter One.
On the treatment of water which is contained in the heads of children. (This likely refers to hydrocephalus.)
Know that this illness often comes to children after childbirth, and when the nurse squeezes the child's head carelessly/without gentleness. (This probably refers to birth trauma).
And sometimes it happens due to a hidden cause which is not known.
But I have not seen this illness except in children; and in all those whom I saw, death followed, and thus it seems to me a wasted effort in those cases. (Meaning the author found the condition untreatable)
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always so enlarged that he could not sit up by himself because of the size of his head, and further, the fluid increased until he died.
And this fluid is either collected between the skin and the bone, or it is collected below the bone, above/on the nape (back of the neck).
For the operation in this case, if the fluid is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you must cut in the middle of the head with an incision latitudinally, and let the length of the incision be almost two fingers so that the fluid may drain, and this is the shape of the spatum (bandage/compress):
And then if the fluid is more abundant and the abscess is larger, then there are two incisions made in this manner:
And if the fluid is below the bone, a sign of it is that you will see the sutures of the head opened on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress it with your hand on the inside parts, and this is not hidden from you. You must cut in the middle of the head with three incisions in this manner:
and after the incision, extract all the fluid; and then bind the incisions with cloths and soft lint; and then soak it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and feed the patient with dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, which considers where the size of the abscess and the collection of fluid appear, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore pay attention with the incision where the abscess and the fullness of the fluid appear, and do this as best you can.
And take care not to cut the artery and consequently cause bleeding and the patient dies from that blood flow with evacuation of fluid.
Second Chapter (This is a repetition of the previous line, likely a stylistic choice).
When someone develops cataracts or rheum (discharge) in the eyes or feet, and it is chronic, and medical treatments are not effective, then the last resort is the incision of those two arteries.
Therefore, when you want to incise them, have the patient shave their head, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and then tighten the patient's neck with a cloth; then consider where the vein pulsates; the locations of each are on the areas near the depressed parts close to the ears, and they are so hidden except in some men.
And then mark the artery with ink, and then incise each one with a scalpel, sharpened on each side, with an incision reaching to the bone, and let this be across the width of the head (or perhaps "along the side of the head," depending on the precise meaning of "latitut").
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery and cut it at the incisions on the upper parts.
And let the length of the incision be about the width of two fingers joined together, because when a vein is incised, the blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which spurts out frequently.
But if the artery doesn't appear to the touch, then you must measure from the ear a space of three fingers, and then mark with ink, and cut to the bone.
And the amount of blood that should be let is six ounces, and very soon you let out more or less, and all that depends on the apparent strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
And then examine the wound, and if any part of the pericranium remains on the bone, then incise it so that a hot abscess doesn't develop afterward.
And then pack the wound with soft feathers and linen bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
On the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from a chronic migraine or acute catarrh, due to harmful moisture and [poor] quality in the tissues of the temples, or ancient vehement dizziness similar to these, and is treated with medical cures and it doesn't help, then we have proven in these illnesses the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or cauterization of them as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hairs which are on the temples; and pay attention to the artery visible in the temple for it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden only in a few men due to the vehemence of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's neck should be constricted with some cloth; and then rub the place with a rough cloth or steam the place with hot water until the artery appears manifestly to you. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you peel the skin with it [the spatula] gently until you reach the artery; and then make an incision there and extract it [the artery] at the upper parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics/membranes which are beneath it, completely.
But if the artery is thin/small, then wrap it with the tip of the hook/lancet, and then cut a part of it according to the amount by which its extremities are elongated and constricted, and no flow of blood will occur, for if they are not incised, the blood will not rise at all.
And then drain from six ounces of blood up to three.
And if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or with long cords, and not fear putrefaction before the healing of the wound and the occurrence of blood flow.
And then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures/ties; and do this at that time or shortly thereafter.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery down to the bone with a knife-like cautery until its extremities are incised, and it will serve in place of that same procedure.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or is of a warm complexion; for cautery is among those things that promote the resolution of humors, and therefore it is better in aiding recovery.
And after the extraction of the arteries, you must fill the place with old cotton, and powders suitably made should be placed over it, and then it should be treated with drying medications that promote flesh growth and with others until it is healed.
And if while you are operating a second time bleeding occurs from the artery, then you should hurry to stop that blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the place with cotton, and press your hand on it until the bleeding is stopped/reduced. And if none of these things are available to you, then place your finger over the area until the blood clots, and wash the area with very cold water until the sharpness/pain subsides, and it is constricted as necessary.
And the easiest thing in extracting an artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and apply each one, heated by fire, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between its ends is lengthened, because they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form/shape of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be similar/equal. But however, if it is less sharp than two knives, it is better, because if it is as sharp as two knives it will stick to any wound, and it will not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, as there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut easily.
And this work/method is better in every operation and easier.
And let the space which is between the two blades be the size/width of a finger's thickness.
Chapter Four.
On the treatment of acute and acidic tears of the eyes. (Alternatively:  Of the body in regards to the treatment of sharp and acidic tears from the eyes).
When there are acidic tears, and the source of these is the veins which are on the front of the head, and you find no other cause in this for the medical treatment, and you see the face of the patient redden and feel on their forehead a crawling sensation as if it were the movement of ants, and their eyes are weakened, moist so that their lashes are stuck together, and the eyelids are irritated by the sharpness of the tears, the ancient doctors have often used this operation for their treatment, and I will describe this treatment briefly.
And you instruct the patient to shave the hairs which are on their forehead, and then make three incisions on the forehead equally spaced along the length of the forehead. And if the length of the incision is two fingers: the first incision should be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the muscles which are in the tear duct, and the third on the other side.
And beware of cutting the arteries which are on both sides, and keep your hand away from the joint of the two jaws (mandibles). And let the length of each incision be the measure of three fingers placed together.
And have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which you dry the blood.
And then insert the spatula with two pointed ends, of which this is the form of the incision: which is from the area of the temples down to the second incision. Scrape with that (instrument) all the tissue which is between the two incisions, down to the pericranium (membrane) which is over the bone, and then do the same from the middle incision down to the second incision. And then remove this spatula and insert another time into the first incision another instrument which is called a knife, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp side of it towards the flesh adjacent to the tissue, and the smooth side of it inwards toward the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure/crack, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But ensure that the incision is continuous with that separation of the tissue, and then do the same in the middle fissure down to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient amount of blood has flowed, press out (clear) the area of the pieces of clotted blood.
And then place in each fissure some old cotton, and place over these compresses soaked in wine and oil and sour wine, and watch that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day, undo the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm water or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
On the treatment of excessive tearing (or rheum) caused by cataracts and to the eyes descending from the inner parts of the head.
When someone experiences acute and persistent cataracts, and you see the patient's eyes thinned and small, and their sight is weakened, and their eyelids are ulcerated and their eyelashes are falling out, and there is a sharp, throbbing pain in the forehead accompanied by emaciation, then know by these symptoms that the matter and cataracts come from many veins originating from the inner parts.
And the best treatment for this is the following: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in it in the middle of the forehead, a little wide (and start with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the temporal muscles which are moved by chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or with a dry cloth and then fill the space between the two edges of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then tighten over it with small cushions soaked in wine and oil so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And when you untie this and see that the swelling has diminished, then you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow in it, and then treat it with a drying treatment which makes the flesh grow, such as if you take two parts wheat flour and four parts rosin and mix them, and make a plaster from them and apply it to these wounds for the generation of flesh.
Chapter 6.
On the treatment of things that fall into the ears.
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four kinds, for it is either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass, or it is from a plant such as grain or a bean, or it is a liquid substance such as water and sour wine and things like them, or some animal.
And so when a stone or another similar thing falls into the ear, of those things that do not swell or grow in the ear, then place the ear in the sun, and if you see the stone, then pour into it some violet oil or sesame oil, and then try to extract it, and make the person sneeze with pepper, and block the nostrils just before the sneeze comes. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear upwards, for many times it is thrown out by these means.
And if it is not thrown out, then extract it with the instrument called a subtle ear probe, of which this is the form:
And if it is removed with the probe, good; and if not, then extract it with a subtle hook of small bend/double curve.
And so if it is not removed by this, then make a tube of brass and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear and seal around the tube with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open but the tube. And then extract it with your breath by strong suction, for many times it comes out with this that we have recounted.
But if it is not removed in this manner, then take a small quantity of burnt alum or prepared glass, with which birds are caught, and place that on the end of a stick/rod, and then wrap cotton decently placed over it. And then insert that into the opening of the ear gently, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And thus if it is not removed with all the things that we have recounted, then you must consider cutting it before a hot abscess or spasm develops.
And the way to cut it is that you at first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to their strength, and then have them sit between your hands and turn their ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear behind their cheek in the most prominent location. And the incision should be moon-shaped until you reach the stone, and, the stone found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then sew the incision at that time quickly, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the thing fallen into the ear is one of the growths that increase and swells, then administer treatment and extract it; but if it doesn't respond to such treatment, then you take thin, dyed linen according to this method: and administer with it the removal of that growth which has fallen into the ear.
And don't do this when you think that it is already moistened by the moisture/vapor of the ear, but put it in many pieces, and then remove them with hooks or with a fine gesture/movement, or with an incision as we have said, for its extraction is facilitated.
But for water that has entered the ear, it is necessary that the patient sneeze with seasoning at the beginning, and fill his ear with some old cotton, and lie on that ear in which the water is, and if by this it is expelled, good; and if not, then take many dyed stones the length of the finger, and heat them in the fire a little, and the patient inserts one of these into the hole of his ear and hops on the one foot of that side and strikes with another stone on the stone which is inside the ear. Then don't stop this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Then don't stop this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And the water will be expelled thus:  take paper or cloth and put one end of it in the ear and light the other end with fire until most of it is burned.
And then put in another piece of cloth and do this as many times as necessary until all the water is expelled, and draw it out with a tube just as was said above about the stone for extraction.
But in the extraction of a creature entering that ear, if it is small-bodied, such as a flea or similar, treat it as we have said in the section; but if it is large-bodied, which is apparent to the sense of sight, then administer its extraction with movements and hooks, and its case is easier than all the other cases that happen in the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the section and in the treatise on distillations and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you examine the ear in the sunlight.
And then if some sort of worm appears there, extract it with movements or with fine hooks, but if nothing appears, then take a tube, narrow below and wide above, of which this is the form: And insert the narrow end into the ear as far as the patient can bear; and then suck strongly with it, and do this many times until all the worms are driven out.
But if it does not obey you thus, then you block and close the circumference of the tube with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already tested in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring, with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear, be with this instrument of which this is the form: And make it of silver or brass, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and with a flat top above.
And thus it will be as a pusher for what is in the cavity of the cannula to constantly [move it to] where it is needed. And if you wish, take the ray (rod/probe) and wrap cotton decently on its end, and then pour oil into the cavity of the ear, or juice of some herb, or whatever you want of these medicines into the tube — and that is in the ear — and then insert the ray with cotton on top and press it with your hand with moderate compression until the oil is expelled into the cavity of the ear and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what is poured into the ear should already be slightly warmed by fire. And be careful that the substance which you instill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
On the treatment of blockage of the ears.
Sometimes some children are born from their mothers' wombs without ear openings, and this also happens in some men, a blockage in the ear canal due to a growth or excess flesh there; and this blockage is sometimes located deep in the ear canal, which impedes hearing, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.
And that which occurs deep within, which affects hearing, is among the most difficult conditions to heal.
And in the case where hearing is affected, you should place the patient's ear in the sunlight and examine it. And then, if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a thin spatula, of which this is the shape:
Its end should have a small width, one side sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be smooth on both sides so that it does not injure the ear.
And so, if the blockage is due to flesh growing in the ear or in its canal, then take it with thin hooks and cut it with great care until all the flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is in the inner part of the ear, then take a thin, smooth root and heat it slightly with fire, and then place it in the ear canal.
And so if you have found a blockage with this that the patient feels as a difficulty in hearing, gently force it out; and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a piece of linen, according to the size of the opening, which you have covered in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are certain of the healing of the wound; or take some alum, dissolve it in rosewater, pulverize it, sprinkle it over ground seeds, and use this; and if you see that the ear has become abscessed, then you must remove the alum and replace it with other alum that you will wrap in a plaster made with rose oil, until the heat of the abscess has subsided; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the other treatment which restricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
On the treatment of a sty which occurs on the eyelids.
Styes which occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore, you must hold them with forceps or a hook, and cut them with a spatula from their roots, and then place ground sedge on the areas.
But if pain with a flow of blood occurs, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and they often return when some part of their roots remains; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that occurs in the eyelids.
Often a condition occurs in the eyelids which resembles a swelling in its firmness and hardness, and therefore it is called swelling.
And it is an accumulation of thick humor in the upper and lower eyelid.
Therefore, the treatment for them is that you consider then if the swelling originates in the eyelid itself and is movable in every direction; and its cause is mild.
Then make a longitudinal incision on it, and then carefully peel it off in every direction with ease until it is detached, and then lift it with a hook and cut it off.
And if the wound is large, then you close it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it because the ointment will restore and heal it.
And if the growth is leaning towards the inner parts of the eyelid below the inner surface, then lift the eyelid and raise the growth with a hook, so that you don’t need an incision, and press it on all sides, and if the eyelid is stretched by the incision, that doesn't matter at all.
And after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with a healing substance until it is healthy.
Chapter 10.
About the treatment of fleshy growths (axcirnah - likely a type of growth or cyst) on the eyelid above the eye.
Axcirnath is a growth which develops in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and occurs mostly in children, affecting their eyes and often causing cataracts in them; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because of this, for tears flow from their eyes.
And so you see them lying on their faces all the time, and they sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below their eyebrows are moist, covered with swelling, and a noticeable prominence of the axcirnath is apparent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the axcirnath within.
And the method of operation is this: the patient rests their head on your lap, then place a cloth on them and create a frame/border, make a circle according to the size which contains the axcirnath completely, then place this upon it and press with your fingers all around so that the axcirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle, and then make an incision in the middle of that moist area with a lancet, making a cut along its width, and the cut should not be larger than the incision made in phlebotomy (blood-letting).
But in the beginning, you must split the skin until you reach the axcirnath, because in later stages the axcirnath develops through the incision like a white fatty substance.
Then extract it with cloths that you have wrapped around your fingers externally and roll it between your right and left hand until it is removed.
And be careful not to go too deep in the incision so that with the instrument you do not reach the eye and damage it.
But if you don't see the axcirnath at the beginning of the incision, then you should carefully go a little deeper in the incision until the axcirnath appears; then extract it as we have said; then submerge cloths in water and wine vinegar and place them on the area and bind them with bandages.
And there are some who grind salt and place it in the cavity of the incision so that it absorbs what remains of the moisture/humidity.
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess develops in the area, then treat it with sedative plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
On the methods of examining/palpating the eye.
When hairs grow on the eyelids, close under the natural hairs, and become hardened, they irritate the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tearing, softening of the eyelids, and inflammation, which can lead to the destruction of the eye, which is called a sty (tactinir) of the eye.  It is treated in four ways: either by cauterization with fire; or with a sharp medicine as described previously in the chapter on cautery; or the sty (atactini) is removed by incision and suture; or with tubes, as I will explain.
And therefore, you must place the patient's head on your lap.  Then turn the eyelid with your left hand, and if it is turned, good; and if not, insert a needle into it, which has thread attached to the lower part of the eyelid, and push the needle with the thread upwards, and this should be near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow — close to the hairs — and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it back with the thread.
Then make an incision on the inner part of the eyelid, below the ingrown hairs, with a lancet, from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller lacrimal duct. Then remove the thread and place small pieces of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and then bandage over the eyelid with a dressing, and it should be shaped like a myrtle leaf.
But the shape should be according to the size of the swelling of the eyelid, for this varies in people; for in some, a large amount of the eyelid needs to be incised according to how much the eyelid is swollen.
Then make incisions with the lancet along the two lines that you have marked, and start from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller lacrimal duct. And make your incision near the natural eyelashes about the thickness of a hair.
Then place the hook in one of the two corners of the swelling/growth (codena), and then excise it completely, and then stitch the two edges of the incision with silk thread or fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and cause what is superfluous from the threads to stick to the eyebrow with some sticky substance if you want to do this, and if not, don't bother.
Then leave the stitching of the threads for three or four days, and then take care of it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitching, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, for the eyelid is lifted/raised by the sealing of the wound and its joining/healing; but stitching is better. And thus said the ancients regarding styes/hordeolum (taxanir).
But however, take care with the patient, as it is a delicate operation, and there is risk involved.
And there is another method for styes (taxmir), which is to make a mark on the eyelid shaped like a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid with three hooks separated and arranged in this form:
But if it's not possible to hold the hooks, and this is not leveled, then take a needle threaded with a suture and place it in the middle of the figure, then place another suture near the larger lacrimal duct, and the second suture near the smaller lacrimal duct, and adjust the sutures between your fingers evenly, and then with these lift your hand evenly, lifting the entire fold which is marked as we have described.
And then join the two lips of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess develops near your incision or laceration, soothe that abscess with a plaster and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are inverted, then you should use on it what we have said about incisions; but stitching in each case is more skillful/refined.
Splinting with reeds is done in the following manner: You should turn the eyelid and cut the figure that is inside as I have described; and then skillfully make two reeds or two thin splints whose length corresponds to the length of the eyelid and whose width is less than the width of the probe/spatula. And you have already made incisions at the edges of each part, where you are holding the threads.
Then carefully add each [splint] subtly over the excess of the eyelid's skin, and bind the reeds on each side with firm pressure, and leave it like that for a few days, because the flesh constricted by the pressure will die and be denied [nourishment] and will rot until it falls off by itself.
But if it is delayed, then break it with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Then, when it has solidified/healed, the eyelid is lifted and the eyelashes do not prick/irritate (the eye).
And this is the form of two reeds which you will make according to this shape: and it should have this quantity of length and width, neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
On the lifting/removal of irritating eyelashes in the eye with a needle when the eyelash is hard/ingrown.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough and irritating eyelashes in the eyes, then the procedure is that you take a fine needle and place in it a fine thread of silk and linen, and then you adjust its ends and tie each in a very subtle way/with a very small knot. And let the length of the threads be the quantity of one palm (handspan).
And then you arrange another fine thread beneath it, short, and knot the ends of that if you wish.
And then have the patient place their head on your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is well-lit, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the offending eyelash which needs removal, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull it out above the natural eyelash.
And then pull the hair out and insert it into a depilatory (or plaster/salve), and let the hairs be one or two or three and no more.
And then pull your hand with it [the hair and depilatory/plaster] until the hair is ejected with the depilatory from the eyelid along with the natural eyelash.
But if the depilatory is pulled and the hair is not ejected, you will pull the depilatory downwards with the bile which you have mixed with it, until the depilatory is ejected from the upper hole.
And watch it [the process] with the sight of the eye, for then you will remove the depilatory and the bile, and close each eye and cover it up, and leave it covered for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is too short, then you should attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and it [the new hair] is lifted with it [the attached natural hair], or you can leave it until it grows somewhat longer, and then you lift it.
Chapter 13
On the treatment of ectropion, which occurs in the upper eyelid.
When ectropion occurs in the eye, and there is a contraction of the eyelid when it is pulled upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor healing of a plague sore, a cut or cauterization, and it is called "hare eye," and this ectropion is either natural or accidental, and is caused by the healing of plague sores or cuts or cauterizations, or similar poorly treated conditions.
But the way to operate on it is that you cut that hardened tissue and separate its edges/lips, and place between them a linen cloth wick, and bind them until they are healed.
And you should not use drying, constricting treatments on it; because if you do this, the ectropion will return worse than it ever was.
Use on it things that soften, such as fenugreek, and foment with water in which marshmallow and linseed have been cooked, or diachylon ointment, which should be liquefied with some oils, and soak the wick in this, and treat with that.
And the key to your treatment is that you completely prevent it from hardening/scarring again in the way it did at the beginning.
And this operation that we have described is only a partial correction of ectropion which doesn't restore the area to the shape it had before.
Chapter 14.
On the treatment of ectropion which occurs in the lower eyelid.
This ectropion, which occurs in the lower eyelid, is what is truly called ectropion; and there is one type that is natural, another that is accidental.
But accidental ectropion is caused by a wound or a tear or by cauterization or other similar things.
And the way to operate is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pass from the left lacrimal point to the right lacrimal point, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
And then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and sew it with the needle, and make an incision with a wide spatula/instrument. And then if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good; and if not, take the thread and place it in the split area, and with it turn the eyelid, and make two incisions on the side of the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two incisions be at the two angles of the larger incision which you have made, so that they meet, and form an angle between them, so that when they come together, their shape is made.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda (Λ).
And then remove/cut away that flesh for the width of the side of it sticking out below, that is, the eyelid.
And then join the separated parts and sew them with woolen thread; and then treat them with what we have said about softening medicines and ointments until it is healed.
And if an ulcer develops because of an incision or suture or cauterization, then you need to make a clean incision on the skin of the eyelid as described previously. And then separate [the two edges of the wound] with the ointment between the two lips [of the wound] as we have said.
In summary of the discussion on the treatment of ulcers, whether above or below, the operation should proceed according to the preparation for the type of ulcer, which occurs in the form of diverse swellings/lumps.
And the skilled practitioner always diligently prepares in every way possible to restore the [affected area] to its natural form, or close to it, and [treats] that patient as is appropriate with the operation and instruments in the best arrangements.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many men, such that the upper eyelid is adhered to the white of the eye, and is hindered from easy movement and its natural functions, then you should insert the end of the probe under the eyelid, and lift it upwards, or extend it with a hook.
And then you incise the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not have sharp incisions, having a slightly blunt [edge] so that the patient is not distressed during the operation, and position the spatula so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And make your incision in such a way that it excises that adhesion easily until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and all the adhesion is healed.
And then you put salt water in the eye, with which you wash it; or instill in it egg yolk dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid and the eye with some lint, and place wool infused with egg white over the eye, and then on the third day use consolidative agents (medications that promote healing) until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
On incision of the nail and of fleshy excrescence of the tear ducts (lacrimal caruncle).
Know that a nail is of two kinds, for either it is sinewy/fibrous, and is similar to a hard, thin film/membrane; or it is non-sinewy/non-fibrous, resembling a frozen white humidity, which when an iron touches it, or it is forced to be grasped with a hook, is cut off and the hook is not stuck in it.
And both types begin only at the larger lacrimal duct/caruncle from where it goes little by little until it covers the sight and obstructs the light and the movement of the eye.
But the way of operating in its incision is that the patient places their head on your knee, and then opens their eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with a hook with a shallow bend/curve and extend it upwards. And then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair or ox hair or cow hair, or similar, or strong thread, or bend the end of the needle little by little and insert it into the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it upwards, and scrape with the hair the sides of the nail which follows the pupil. And thus you follow it with the thread/hair to its back/rear.
And then you incise the remainder at the root of the lacrimal caruncle with a fine spatula or with small scissors, and leave the flesh of the natural lacrimal caruncle so that a continuous flow of tears does not occur due to its incision.
And sometimes the nail, extended with the hook alone or with thread, as we have said, and then be scraped with a lion's spatula of which this is its form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and cause a rupture in it, and that the pupil be perforated.
Then, into the incision/wound put a little ground salt or wound-powder made from pig fat, and leave that in until the next day; and then treat it with what is needed until it is healed.
And if the nail bed is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, nor is the hook inserted in it, then often this type of nail ailment is treated with medicines, and is healed just as I have recounted in the chapter/section.
And if you want to incise it, then you open the patient's wound and take a thin, sharp steel lion's spatula of this form: with thinness/finely. And if you see that it (presumably the wound/affected area) is thinned and damaged and eaten away, then instill into that place oil of your choice made from pig fat, or with red oil or with ground salt, and cover the wound until the next day.
And then repeat the procedure on it until everything that is there is removed, unless a hot, opposing abscess is in the wound, for then you leave it, and treat the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your procedure on it reasonably/methodically until it is healed.
If the protruding lacrimal caruncle causes great harm in the wound, it should be lifted with a hook; and incise a part of it, but do not complete the incision so that you do not cut into the flow of tears.
And then instill red oil made of pig fat into the tear duct until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
On the incision of an abscess and of that which is born of flesh attached/formed in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some people a red flesh grows, and it spreads until it covers the pupil, or approaches or presses on the eyelids and very quickly compresses the eyelids on the outer parts and is similar to a pomegranate flower.
But the operation for it is that the patient places his head in your lap; and then open his eyes and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it with forceps or with these; and then cut the flesh at the beginning until it is all finished with the scalpel, and beware of the eye that you do not injure it during your operation.
And your incision, with which you cut those, may be with a spatula which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which a sliver is removed, according to the form of it near this chapter.
Then when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with powdered salt, or sprinkle on it red powder and similar corrosive medicines, and place on the eye externally cotton with egg white until it is safe from hot swelling/inflammation.
And if some cause of swelling remains and hot blood dominates, and you fear a hot swelling/inflammation, then leave the eye and treat that swelling with what reduces that swelling, and then repeat the operation on it until it is healed, and similarly do with the excess flesh which you find in the eye of this kind.
But however you must avoid all treatment of a cold eye by natural means or by accidental means, working with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that that member is able to tolerate that operation.
Chapter 18.
About/Concerning the collection of sand in the eye.
Sand (or Gravel) means red veins that are stretched/spread over the eye and obstruct its vision/function, and weaken the eye over a long period of time.
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which the sand is, is strong and there is no other disease in it other than the sand, then you may remove that sand.
And you should instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, and then lift/raise those veins with a hook or with two according to your judgment; and let that hook be of fine/thin double-pronged form/make according to this shape:
or it is two hooks/prongs gradually merging into one body in this manner/shape:
And then those veins should be grasped with fine forceps, gently, and wipe/clean the blood from time to time, until you see those veins be removed from the eye and turned/folded back.
And take care that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the spatula/instrument; and do your operation at midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation that you incise/cut only those veins.
And when you have finished, then you instill in the eye green or red onion juice so that with its sharpness it corrodes what is remaining of the sand/grit/foreign body.
But if this is not possible for you to remove it all at that time, then you apply a plaster with something that soothes his pain, and leave it for some days until his pain subsides and he is safe from a hot abscess/inflammation.
And then repeat on him according to the same method until he is healed.
And this is the form/shape of the scissors/forceps:
Chapter 19.
On the reduction of nasal polyps/swellings.  (Arizati likely refers to some kind of nasal growth or inflammation.)
When you treat nasal swellings with a cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine as previously described and it is not healed, then there is no other option but to cut open the abscess upon its maturation, and to extract all the moisture which is in it and the pus until the bone is exposed/uncovered.
And then when the bone is uncovered/exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form/shape:
And it is called a rasp, and it should be made of Indian steel, and its head should be round like a hazelnut, which should be made pointed/rough by filing or scraping with fine points (as shown in the following image/diagram).
And place it on the corrupted area of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away/removed.
And this should be done several times, and then treat/dress the area with drying and astringent substances/remedies.
Then if the area is consolidated/healed and good flesh has grown there, and the flow of pus has stopped and remains so for forty days, and it is not renewed and does not become abscessed and no complications/accidents occur in it, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is no other solution but to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and in this manner: you must expose the bone underneath with an iron instrument or with a sharp medicine, and when the bone is exposed, then you take a drill/trephine in this way/shape:
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and its shaft be thinly drawn out to the tip as you see here. (likely accompanied by a diagram)
And then place it on the bone, and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand slightly away from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the drill/trephine until it penetrates all the way through the bone, and the patient will feel it because he finds wind coming out from under his hand.
Then afterwards treat the area with styptic and drying medicines as I have taught you.
Then when the flesh grows and the area is hardened, the matter which flowed to the outer parts returns to the nose, and this is less burdensome for the patient.
Chapter 20.
On reducing the swelling of the eye.
When the entire eye swells and there is no damage or diminishment of vision, then you should bleed the patient, and then purge him, and then apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification and suck with good suction; and then apply a liniment made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla to the eye, and then tighten a plaster over the eye with a soft cloth.
And the way to make the cloths is to take soft linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded in four layers; and make compresses from these.
And then place them one on top of the other according to the amount that the eye needs. And then tighten over them with a hard cloth, binding it firmly; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
But if in the meantime the swelling has softened, then it should be bound less tightly.  (Implying a looser bandage).
And then remove the bandage during the day and night, as we have said.
And if you see that the eye is already reduced (back to normal), good; and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders and the binding and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On the incision of the prominence of the uveal tunic (of the eye).
When a rupture occurs in the uveal tunic (of the eye), and it protrudes and projects beyond the eyelids like a grape, and a person's appearance is marred by this, and you want to incise it, then the operation on it is as we have recounted: that you insert the needle into the roots of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, and then put in another needle which has a double thread on the side of the tear duct, and make that one penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; and then incise the location of the double thread and lift with it the part of the uvea around the needle, and tighten it a lot.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white and leave it until the thread falls off with the (protruding part of the) uvea.
And then treat the eye with something that strengthens it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes it gathers from all sides with a circle of cloth inside the eye near the large protrusion, and then it is pierced with a fine spatula that reaches the front of the eye, and the albuminous fluid runs, and the eye shrinks and goes in immediately.
And then tighten (it/bandage it) until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of elbows (or possibly *alconati*, a specific elbow condition).  It could also mean "of those with elbow problems.
This disease, which is called alconati, is nothing but blood which has collected in the eye, resembling dripping water, but is not (water).
But the way to operate on it is as follows: have the patient sit on a prepared and upright saddle, then take their head in your two hands, on both sides, and move it until you see the blood reach the lower parts, then it should be dried and not descend.  And the light should be blocked, and the patient will see things as they saw before.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water (and not blood).
But if the descent of the blood is not prepared by what we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands and take a thin spatula, and with this work on the thin membrane [panniculus, perhaps a membrane of the eye], pushing it a little bit down where the conjunctiva meets the cornea (in the corona), into the empty space, until the blood is expelled.
Then, when it is expelled, you should instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then it should be treated with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of watery discharge from the eye. /  About the treatment of tearing/watery eyes.
We have already discussed the types of watery discharge in the classification and which one requires perforation, explaining it clearly; therefore, [treat] that one according to the remedy. / We have already described the types of watery discharges in the classification and which one needs surgical opening, explaining it in detail. Now, regarding the healing/treatment [of that].
Then you should have the patient sit between your legs on a square and tie his healthy eye very tightly.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of his healthy eye, if the eye that has the discharge is the left eye; or with your right hand if the eye [with the discharge] is the right.
And then with your right hand take a probe, if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
And then place the tip of the probe near the edge of the iris, about the thickness of a hair away, in the white of the eye towards the smaller tear duct, and then push the probe in firmly and rotate your hand with it.
And then penetrate the white of the eye until you feel that the probe has reached an empty space.
And the length of the probe's path should be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the edge of the colored part of the eye, which is the iris; for you will see through it the pupil and the vision of the eye because of the clarity of the cornea.
And then place the probe into the area where the fluid is, and then you draw it downwards repeatedly, and if the fluid descends immediately, then at once the patient will regain their sight and [will see] the probe in their eye.
And then rest a little; if the fluid has descended, then you repeat the procedure before removing the probe.
And when it is dry and does not descend, then you carefully remove the probe, turning your hand little by little, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in water and wash the inside of the eye with it; and then cover the outside of the eye with cotton or tow or wool infused in rose oil and egg white, and bandage the eye well with this.
But we and those of our time place on it cumin crushed with egg white.
And if the probe does not yield to you upon entering the eye due to its hardness—for there are some men whose eyes are very hard—then you must take the instrument which is called alberid, of which this is the form:
And then pierce that conjunctiva with it, and do not remove your hand from the instrument, and do nothing but make a subtle path for the probe.
And then insert the probe as we have said.
And after completing your work, a suitably prepared sleeping area should be ready for the patient, in which they sleep on their back in a darkened room, and are forbidden from all movement.
And place things in their natural position so that their nature is soothed, and they don't move their head to the right or left at all.
And the bandaging should be according to his condition until the third day.
And then untie it in that same dark room and prohibit cold sights, and make them see some pleasant things, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And you should not do this during the time of treatments or immediately after the infusion/application (of medicine). It is fitting that you remove this because the water can easily increase due to forceful and excessive urination/defecation (This translation is uncertain, the meaning of "reguardament" is unclear.  It could relate to something being looked at, urination, or a bowel movement. Given the context, a bodily function seems likely).
But if a hot abscess/swelling occurs, then you should untie the bandage before the seventh day, and treat it with something that reduces the abscess/swelling.
Then you should cover his sight and place a cloth over his face through which his breathing can be directed, leaving it there for a few days, while he remains in the dark room.
And afterwards, he should be gradually taken out of that room and spoken to about his affairs/condition.
And know that in surgery the student is not excused from sometimes watching, and so you should be bold in the operation.
And it has come to our knowledge from some of those who are in Artach, and some say that fire is made in a perforated clay vessel (earthenware pot?) in Ayrac with which the water is sucked out.  (This likely refers to some sort of suction device or possibly a primitive still.)
But however, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is a new thing.
And these are the forms of the types of earthenware so that those who don't know them may see them: (This likely refers to illustrations of the pottery.)
And they should be made of bronze or iron specifically, and their ends should be subtly triangular, the tip sharp, just as this is the shape. (Likely referring to surgical instruments.)
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of nasal polyps (literally, "born flesh in the nose").
When various fleshy growths develop in the nose, some of which resemble the many-footed scorpion or the many-footed polyp (octopus); and this malady is called polypus because it resembles that creature. And some of it (the growth) is cancerous flesh, flabby, of a dark color; and some of it is lion-like flesh, not of a dark color.  (Note: "lion-like" likely refers to a specific appearance or texture.)
Therefore, for the kind that is of this lion-like flesh, not fraudulent nor cancerous, you must have the patient sit between your hands and place him in the sun, and open his nostrils, and pick at those fleshy growths with your fingernail. And then pull it outwards, and then cut what you have grasped of it with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; if any of it remains from which excision is possible, then you scrape it with one of the subtle instruments with ease until none of it remains. But if it bleeds profusely or a hot abscess occurs, then you apply what is necessary to it; or if it is of the malignant abscesses, then you burn and cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped and all the cavities are removed.
And after the incision, sour wine and water or just wine should be put into the nose. But if the nose is open and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that inside there is proud flesh growing on the bones above the nostrils, to which the excision has not reached.
Therefore, then it is necessary that you insert ox gall, to which some thickness is added, and mix into it many ground nuts, and place between each application the said amount or less, and lay the patient down and insert one end of the ox gall into the nostrils with a ray or other means possible.
And after this has been done, let him inhale its scent until it reaches the nasal passages, and let it come out onto his throat, for children at school often do similar things, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to do it.
And then place the two ends of the ox gall [bladder], one end coming out over the nose and the other remaining in the nose, and then apply ground meat with the nuts that are in the ox gall, and do this until you know that the flesh is [mixed] with the nuts of the ox gall.
And then remove the ox gall, and immediately after the bloodletting place a plug in the nose, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
And then at the end of the treatment, place a lead tube in the nose for some days until it is healed.
But if you need a drying treatment, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument for cleansing the head with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make it of silver or brass, which should resemble a small open lamp, like a small shell, and the spout similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed tube like a reed, and the tube of the head-cleansing instrument should be flat and uncovered; to which there should be a handle at its back, with which you hold it when you heat oil or water in it, or whatever you want of juices and absorbable substances.
Chapter 25.
Of boils born at the extremities of the nose.
Many times a boil arises on the tip of the nose, and it grows and swells over several days until it is very ugly to look at.
And therefore you must incise it at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it. And then apply to the area either a cautery or a burning medicine that will stay in its place.
But if its incision is delayed until it has grown large, then consider if it is hardened, firm, dark-colored and with little feeling. Then do not touch it with an iron instrument, for it is a cancerous sore; for many times, great harm comes upon the one who incises this sore, just like what happened to the one who had it.
And if the sore is somewhat soft to the touch and not of a dark color, and you see that incision is possible throughout, then have the patient vomit (or purge) and incise it without fear, and treat the area with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
On suturing the nose and lips and the ear when the continuity is broken by a wound or similar things.
Know that when you encounter a break in continuity in one of these cartilages, you will rarely achieve success in that operation except in some men.
Therefore, when such a case happens to someone, you must consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then you bring the two edges of the wound together with sutures, and treat it accordingly until it is healed.
And if the edges of the broken continuity are already separated, and each is healed, then you must excoriate each part of its apparent skin until blood comes out. And then bring the two edges together with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle on them dragon's blood and ground incense, and place over the powder a piece of diachylon plaster, or some other consolidative plaster, and leave it bandaged for two or three days, and then untie it and change that plaster and leave it until the threads [sutures] are cut by themselves, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
But the method of suturing is that you either join the broken continuity with needles as we have recounted in the suturing of the abdomen, or join the broken continuity with thread as has been made known to you.
Chapter 27.
On the extraction of those things that come into the two lips [edges of a wound] in the inner parts.
Many times it happens to many men in the inner parts of their labia [lips, edges of a wound] some hard abscesses resembling pig fat, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you turn out the lips [edges of the wound] and cut each one of those hardnesses completely, and after the excision you fill the area with crushed sage until the blood is stanched, and afterwards it should be washed with sour wine and the place treated with something that is styptic, until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
On the incision of the flesh attached to the gums.
Many times there grows on the gums attached flesh which the ancients called albulus, therefore it is necessary that you lift it with a hook or that you hold it with forceps and cut it down to its root, and let the pus or the blood run.
And afterwards place on the area crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it, for after the cautery it will not return.
Chapter 29.
About extracting teeth with iron (instruments).
When on the surface of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums, rough, thin scabs accumulate, and sometimes they become blackened and turn yellowish or green until the gum is affected by this corruption, and the teeth become loose.
And then you must have the patient sit between your knees and rest their head on your chest, and scrape the teeth on which these scabs and sand-like things appear until nothing of them remains, and do this with the blackness and the yellowness and the others until they are cleaned.
Then if what was there at the beginning of the procedure has been removed, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the procedure on them the next day and the second and the third until you reach the final stage of what you want.
And know that teeth require many scrapers of different shapes and many figures according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped on the inside is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth according to other shapes, and these shapes of scrapers you should have prepared, which you will see immediately:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
It is appropriate that you treat the tooth for its pain with all care and be slow in all its extraction, because there is nothing that replaces it once it is extracted, for it is a noble substance so that it is excusable in its extraction.
But it is fitting, when the patient is forced to extract that tooth, that you be firmly certain which is the aching tooth, because many times the pain deceives the patient and he thinks that it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the work of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which is the aching tooth, and you know it well, then it is fitting that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is loosened from the tooth and the gum on all sides, and then pull it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at the beginning little by little until you extract it.
And then apply strong large tongs with good leverage or a strong grip, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold it well so that it doesn't move, and then pull the tooth straight out in such a way that you don't break it, nor cause the patient more pain.
And if it is not thrown out, then take one of those instruments, and put it under it on all sides with ease and force its removal in the same way as it is done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is broken or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth and tighten it with the end of a thin root so that it is not broken at the time of your squeezing it with tongs.
And it is necessary that you work carefully with scarification around the entire gum and watch your strength so that you do not break it and a piece of it remains, and returns upon the patient with a worse affliction than his first pain.
And beware of doing what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity concerning their eradication, without administering what we have recounted; for many times they cause great illnesses to come upon men which are more difficult to cure, and the roots of them remain entirely, or some of them, or that you extract it with some bones of the jaw as we have witnessed many times.
And after its eradication, the mouth should be washed with warm wine or sour wine with salt.
And if blood flow occurs because of this, as often happens, then grind some amount of vitriol and sprinkle it on the wound, and if the vitriol is not effective, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps with which the tooth is moved at the beginning should be of long extremity, with a short and thick handle, so that they are not bent when you must work with them.
And they should be like you see with a thick handle so that when you squeeze with them they are not bent, and have short extremities.
And they should be made of Indian steel, suitably made with straight extremities, and at the ends of these should be teeth, some of which fit into the others and tighten by strong constriction, and sometimes the extremities of these are in the shape of the beak of a bird which is named stork, that is crane, and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
On the extraction of teeth and the removal of broken jaw bones.
When you must extract a tooth which is broken and some part remains, then you need to place cotton with butter on the area for a day or two until the place is softened; and then insert forceps or tongs whose extremities are similar to the beak of a bird called stork or crane, the shape of the forceps:
Their extremities should be made with teeth like a file or saw.
And if it doesn't yield to you in this manner with these forceps or tongs, then you need to dig at the root and remove all the flesh and insert the instrument which is called atali, that is, a small lever whose form is this:
And let it have a short end, a little thick, and not tapered so that it is not broken.
Then if by this the root is expelled, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is of a triangular extremity in which there is some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it be triangular and with a more subtle/finer extremity/point/tip.
And now help yourself with this instrument having two hooks, of which this is the form near the following: (This suggests an image will follow.) and with other instruments which I will describe previously in scraping/filing of teeth; for help is given with this instrument which is similar to a large hook/claw, and this is its form/shape: (Again implying a following image).
of the triangular extremity, twisted or short, which has some thickness, and is not filed down/sharpened so that it is not broken/brittle.
And also know that the instruments for the teeth are many and similarly the other instruments.
But wise and skilled artisans in the art will find for themselves, according to what the operation and the various diseases indicate to them; for there are diseases which the ancients did not describe nor establish specific instruments for, due to the forms of diverse species/kinds.
But if the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are broken, or if they fester, then let it be carefully treated in its place with that which is suitable from among the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of tooth roots, and help yourself with a lever/elevator, of which this is the form/shape:
And let there be some thickness to it, little by little, and let it be tightened or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or move until the bone is completely expelled/removed; and then restore the area with medicines suitable for this.
But if there is a small amount of decay in the bone, then scrape that decay and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of teeth that stand out above the others.
When the teeth are prominent, not according to their natural position, their shape is therefore ugly, and especially when it happens to women, and especially to venerable young ladies; therefore you must consider: if a tooth has grown next to another tooth, and closing or filing it is not possible, then extract it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you incise it with this instrument, of which this is the shape; and it is similar to a pig's snout, and let it be made of Indian steel with a very sharp point.
And make your incision with which you incise it over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not harm the other teeth.
And if it is a prominent tooth suitable for filing, then file it with a file of Indian steel of which this is the shape:
And let it be entirely of Indian steel and the handle as well; and let it have very fine points like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth may be filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. And then polish it at the end, and scrape it with sharp razors.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and injures the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of that break is removed and smoothed, and it is made even so that it does not injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver foil.
When front teeth are struck and loosened by a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot clench them to chew what they eat, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not been effective, then so that they do not fall out, it is wise that they be tightened with gold foil and not silver, because silver turns green and then rots after a few days, but gold is never altered.
And let the foil be of such thinness and thickness according to the amount that can enter between the teeth; and the method of application is that you take the foil and take twice as much of it between two healthy teeth, and then you press with two twists of the foil between the two damaged ones, or if it's one or many, until the sheet reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving back to the side from which you began, and tighten it with your hand gently and skillfully so that it is not damaged.
And let your tightening with which you tighten the foil be towards the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose.
And then cut off the superfluous ends of the foil with forceps or scissors, and tuck these in each place with a tool, and turn them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue. And then leave it as tight as it is.
But if it is loosened or broken, tighten it or them with another foil in the same manner at any time.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of two healthy teeth and two damaged ones, as you see them bound:
And when one or two teeth are returned near their setting in their places, and they have regrown as we have recounted, and they become damaged again.
And only a good and wise artisan can do this.
And sometimes some sort of device is prepared from cow bones, and made from them in the shape of a tooth, and it is placed in the location where the tooth is missing, and is tightened as we have said, and it remains and serves in that place for a long time.
Chapter 34.
On the incision of the ligament which comes in the tongue and hinders speech.
This ligament, which is found under the tongue, is sometimes natural, with which one is born, or accidental, and occurs due to a plague/wound/sore which has already been consolidated/healed.
And the operation for it is that you open the patient's mouth, their head being placed in your lap; and lift their tongue, and then incise that sinewy ligament along its width until the tongue is released from its restriction.
But if there is any hardness or knotting in it, and this has occurred due to the healing of a plague/wound/sore, then you cast hooks/grasping tools and cut that across its width until you have incised the ligament and the knot is dissolved/untied/released.
And take care that no fissure is made in the underlying flesh and that you cut an artery here and bleeding occurs.
And then the site of the incision should be washed with rosewater or with sour wine or with cold water; and then place lozenges/medicated tablets under the tongue; that is, a wick/plug which the patient holds under the tongue every night so that it is not consolidated/healed closed again.
But if bleeding occurs, place crushed/powdered vitriol on the area; but if the blood continues to flow, then cauterize the area with a lenticular/lens-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula [cyst] from under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess resembling a small lump occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and it quickly grows until it fills the mouth.
And the procedure for it is that you open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is a dark or black color, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, then do not touch it for it is cancerous.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then put your hook into it, and incise it with a subtle spatula, and cut it on all sides; and if blood comes to you at the time of your operation, then you place crushed vitriol (copper sulfate) on it, until the blood is stopped.
And then return to your work until you have completely removed it; then wash it with sour wine and salt; and treat it with the other treatment appropriate to this until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
On the extraction of an abscess from both ears and of that which grows in the throat and of other abscesses.
When swelling occurs in the throat, that is, glands that are clustered together, which protrude outwards and are called tonsils, which when you treat them as we have said in the (previous) section and it is not healed, then you consider if the abscess is hard, of a dark color, with little feeling, then do not touch it with an instrument (iron/knife).
And if it is of a red color and the root is large, then do not touch it with an instrument because of the blood flow; rather leave it until it is matured (ripened), and then either you will lance it, or it will rupture by itself.
And if it is of white color, round, and its root is thin, then that is the one that should be incised.
And the procedure for it is that you consider, before your operation, whether the swelling has subsided from its heat with complete rest or if it has diminished with some decrease; and then have the patient sit before the sun, and their head be in your lap, and open their mouth, and the assistant taking an appropriate instrument between their hands presses down the patient's tongue with it, of which this is the form:
And it should be made of silver or brass, and be thin like a knife.
Then when you press the tongue with it and the swelling is shown to you, and you direct your gaze upon it, then take a hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can. Besides this, pull some of the membrane [or: one of the layers/coatings] and then incise it with an instrument of which this is the form:
Besides this, pull some of the membrane [or: one of the layers/coatings] and then incise it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to forceps, however its extremities are curved, so that the opening of each one is towards the other, very sharp, and which should be made of Indian steel, tempered.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then incise it with a spatula of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one slit, incise the other in this same manner of incision, and after the incision the patient should gargle with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, gargle with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and things similar to those with styptic properties until the flow of blood is restricted, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides those behind the two ears, and incise these as I have said in the incision of two slits, similarly.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess which had arisen in her throat, which abscess tended towards a dark color, with little feeling, which had already closed her throat, and the woman was breathing with a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating and drinking water, and she would have died if it had continued for a day or two more.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had pierced two branches until it came out through two holes/openings.
Then I took care of it as if it were a fistula and inserted a hook into one of them [the holes], and pulled it [the hook], and a large portion was drawn out, and then I incised it where I understood it connected to the other hole, and then I opened her mouth, and held down her tongue, and then I inserted the hook into that abscess.
And then I cut away a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Then the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took food, then I did not cease to incise that abscess many times for a long time, and an abscess formed in its place, which I incised until it was gone.
Then I used a cautery and cauterized his throat, then there was scarring; and then I left and didn't know what God did with them/him after that.
Chapter 37.
On the incision of the uvula when it is abscessed.
When a catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is abscessed and long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called buba/buboe.
But when it is treated with what we have said in the section/chapter, and your treatment is not effective, and you similarly see that pus is indeed gathering there and it is subtle, then you must incise the one that is aggregated and round; and if it has that length, and is sanguine, of a dark or black color, and there is no feeling in it, then you must consider/be careful with its incision, because in that there is danger to the patient.
And when you see it in the manner that I have described, regarding its whiteness and length, you should have the patient sit and depress their tongue with an instrument, of which I will describe the form, and then place the hook in the uvula, and pull it down and incise it with one of the two instruments which are mentioned in the incision of the tonsils.
And you must not incise it beyond what is added above the natural boundary, because if you incise more of it, you will injure their speech.
And after the incision, use what we have recommended in the incision of the tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by its incision, you should use ingenuity in its cauterization without fear, and the method of cautery in this case is only with sharp/corrosive water, which is to say that you place the patient's head in your lap, and then depress their tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned, and then take some of the water which we have described in the chapter on cauterization, make a burning coal with it, and apply it neither thickly nor thinly, and with it fill the cavity of the instrument of which this is the form:
Let its tip be concave, in which the medicine is placed, like the concavity of a radish spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and have the patient lie on their side so that saliva or mucus runs from their mouth because of the internal medicine, so that none of it descends onto their throat and harms it.
And then hold your hand with the medicine, and press it onto the uvula for the space of half an hour until you see it blackened and dried by the biting action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a radish, and submerge the cotton in the medicine, and insert the radish with the cotton into a cannula until the cotton adheres to that cannula, and do this as many times as necessary until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it, for it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
And if you deem it necessary to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and then wipe around the cauterized uvula with cotton soaked in egg white, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine, and let it be washed with cold water, and be treated externally with an embrocation, and internally with gargles until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and less fearsome.
Sometimes the uvula is treated with something more subtle than cautery and incision, for it is treated with fumigation in this manner: take calamine, hyssop, origan, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile, borage and similar herbs, and combine all these things, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them in strong wine, and boil; and let the pot be well sealed with lute, and let there be in the middle of the pot a hole, over which is placed a concave instrument of brass in this manner; let it be made of silver or brass.
And let the tip be inserted into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the cannula, until the uvula is very much obscured/darkened (likely meaning: until the swelling reduces).
And then repeat this many times until it is dry, and beware not to do this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of abscesses, for it would aggravate the abscess too much, and you should not do this, but you should wait for the clear manifestation/development of the abscess before cauterizing.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and place an eggshell at the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is protected from burns, for the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good and healthy/safe.
Chapter 38.
On the extraction of thorns and of that which adheres to the throat/esophagus and of other things.
Many times a fish bone or some other thing gets stuck in the throat/esophagus.
Then you must extract what is apparent from these, on which your sight falls, after you depress the tongue with an instrument in front of the sun, so that what is in the throat can be revealed to you.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat/esophagus, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, because very easily the thing attached to the throat/esophagus will be expelled by vomit; or have the patient swallow a piece of turnip or a lettuce stem or a mouthful of dry bread; or take a piece of dry sea sponge, and tie it tightly with thread, and then have the patient swallow it, because when it comes to the place in which the thorns are, and it is pulled out, then they are expelled. And further, take an eel, tie it with thread, and insert it inside and suddenly pull it out; or take a leek, insert it suddenly, and suddenly withdraw it.
But if they are not expelled by these things which we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument according to this form/shape:
And let it be a little thicker than a ray (fish), and at its end let there be a concavity which you insert into their throat with ease.
And let him/her hold his/her head elevated upwards, and be careful that you touch his/her throat bone, lest he/she be harmed, and with that you push the bone or the thorn, or the physician places it with his hand.
But it is better that the patient insert it themselves, because of their knowledge of the location of the attached object, and push it down, and pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the prepared quantity until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of a leech attached to the throat/gullet.
When a leech is medicated with what we have said in the section on healing with medicines and it does not come off, then observe the patient's throat/gullet in the sunlight, after you have compressed their tongue with the instrument that we have recommended to you.
Then, if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with gentle, appropriate movements/gestures.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat/gullet, and then place a heated iron in the cavity of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and detaches from the throat/gullet) and the patient should abstain from water all day.
And then take a glass full of cold water, and have him open his mouth over it, and wash his mouth with it; and do not swallow any of it, and pour the water with your hand, hour after hour, because the leech falls off as soon as it senses the water.
But if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with zedoary or with asafoetida using the instrument that we have recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, and it will fall out.
And there is another method of operating with fumigation for this: you take a pot in which there are burning coals and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which there is a hole, and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then the fumigation should be added on top; and have the patient put his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will immediately fall out.
And if it does not fall out, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and have the patient abstain from drinking, and have him eat salty things and garlic, and not drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen it will be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is extracted from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps as you see, except that there is some curvature in it: which is placed in the throat, and the end of it is similar to a stork's beak, which is toothed, and roughened with a file, so that, when it grasps something, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discussion on opening abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are of many types, in many ways, as mentioned for each of them in this book.
And they are diverse in their perforation and incision in two ways, one of which is by the type of abscess itself; and by the humors it contains.
And the second way is due to the locations in the body in which they occur, for an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the buttock; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy area is different from an abscess occurring in a joint; and each of them has its own treatment by surgery.
And further, there are some abscesses which should not be perforated except near the maturation of the pus within them or their completion.
There are other abscesses which should be lanced when they are raw, and not matured to their completion, such as abscesses that are near the joints, because when an abscess occurs near a joint, its being is prolonged until it can putrefy what is around it, and very quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, which causes contraction of that limb; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay lancing it until it is matured it will harm the principal member; or it is near the anus, then lance it immature; and you should not lance it raw, of incomplete digestion, except the one that is near the anus, so that its core does not putrefy and be elongated to the parts inside the anus, and become a fistula, or that it result in a condition that is not healed. But you should know the time to lance the abscess, and that is when it is matured.
And know that it is matured when the pain and fever cease, and near the decrease of redness and throbbing, and the sharpness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know the perforation should fall in the lowest place of the abscess and where it is most conducive to healing from the swelling.
And the lancing should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the area of the muscles, tendons, or arteries; and, lastly, in all similar places where there is no bending; because in those that are bent, use lancing appropriate to that limb.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to leave it unlanced until its digestion is fully confirmed, as we have said; for if you lance it before that, the course of its pus and much filth is prolonged, and its edges harden very easily, as does its depth.
But some abscesses are lanced across the width of the flesh or body out of necessity, or according to the needs of the limb.
And you should make a small incision for small abscesses, and a large and wide incision or multiple incisions for large abscesses according to the variation in the size of the abscesses.
And there are other abscesses in which the skin must be held concave and incised, when it is made like bread and made at the point that it already protrudes, as happens with many furuncles and buboes.
And some of these are incised with a three-angled incision; and of these there are some which are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, such as abscesses in the corners (of the eye/mouth?).
And of them there are some in which a round or crescent-shaped incision, and similar ones, is used.
But one which is not like these superficial erysipelas abscesses, you should incise with only a superficial, or flat, incision.
And it is necessary when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, that you lance it and do not worry about extracting all the pus at that time; having extracted some of it, then cover the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger amount, and then do this many times gradually until it is all drained.
And especially if the patient is of a cold nature, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit person, because the vital spirit is often dissolved with the outflow of the pus, and the patient dies very easily, and you are to blame.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great care, and then the incision in which you lance these abscesses, you must clean the wounds and then consider if the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then you apply lint or old cotton; and if the abscess is large, and the openings of the incision are many, then you must place a wick in each hole until they join together.
And if in the abscess a part of the skin is cut off or you have hollowed it out in the surrounding area, then you must fill it with old cotton or thread made from linen cloth, as when you have extracted bits of cloth or roots, without moisture; and bind it until the third day; and then proceed and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then you apply cold water and sour wine in which you soak a linen cloth, and place it over the site of the bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must administer the regimen and treatment and powders which I have described in many places of this our book and section.
But if it is in winter, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you should soak powders in warm wine and oil, and place them over the areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you must place powders soaked with water and oil or with wine and oil, and all of this should be cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should loosen the abscess and cleanse it and apply in its treatment what is suitable for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses generally, but following the method of distinction I have already spoken about each abscess in what manner is the way of its treatment by individual chapters.
Chapter 41.
On the incision of abscesses which occur in the back of the head.
On the back of the head, small abscesses, specifically nodes, which contain tunics that are made for them; and their types are many.
And among them are pimples, and of those there are some that contain a moisture resembling file dust.  (This likely refers to a gritty or viscous pus). And among them are some which contain a moisture resembling dust, and similar to them; and among them are some that are stone-like, hard.
And in the incision of all, and in the extraction of these there is no danger, as long as the removal of these does not go against an artery.  (i.e., as long as you don't cut an artery).
And the operation in incising these is that you probe them with an instrument, the shape of which is seen here, which is called a probe/lancet, until you know what it contains.
For if what it contains is moisture, then you cut it with an incision along its length by a superficial cut according to this shape/manner:
And begin the incision from the line B to the line G. Then when the moisture is evacuated, you excoriate/scrape that skin which contained the moisture, and leave nothing of it at all, for it returns too often, if anything of it remains.
And then submerge/soak cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with this and leave it until the next day, for with this you will corrode all that remains of that pellicle/membrane/thin skin.
And then repeat with the cotton and Egyptian ointment a second and third time if you need to, until you are confident that nothing of that pellicle/membrane remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess/boil contains fatty lumps/nodes, then you incise/cut it in this manner/shape: with an incision having the shape of a cross, and place hooks between the two lips/edges of the incision and peel/strip it from all sides, and exert your strength in extracting the tunic/membrane which contains it.
But if it offers resistance to you, then do what I told you first/initially.
And similarly, do the same for the hardened/calcified abscess regarding incision and treatment as we have told you; and incision on a hardened/calcified abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little moisture/fluid.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in some men, in which there is no moisture at all; which is why I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a dull, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if someone were to be struck with it, it would cause injury.
But in other abscesses occurring in the head, other than this one, this chapter does not apply, such as the abscesses that come on the heads of children behind the roots of the ears, but the incision of all of these should be a superficial incision.
And place the perforation of these on their lowest part so that the body may be relieved of the corrupted blood/pus at the lowest points.
And then treat them with that which is appropriate for their healing/treatment.
Chapter 42.
On the incision of scrofula which occurs in the neck.
Many times these abscesses occur in the neck and in the armpits and in the groin/elbows; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, there are many that are generated among them, and every scrofulous tumor of these is within its own tunic/membrane, just like in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for some of them are stone-like, and some of them contain humors/fluids, and some of them are malignant which do not respond to treatment/cure.
Therefore, in the one that you find of good disposition by touch, whose apparent color is close to the color of skin, and is movable in every part, and is not attached to the nerve of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the trachea/windpipe, and is not deep, it is necessary that you incise it with a superficial cut from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line G between the line B, and flay/peel it on all sides, and extend the lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks if you need them, just as we have said about the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is more prudent that the vein or nerve not be incised/cut.
And let the scalpel/blade not be too sharp, lest you injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the patient, and cut what is not necessary to cut; for if you incise a vein or artery and are hindered from your work, then place on the wound ground vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and constrict the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides and the wound is softened and begins to suppurate/drain pus. When the blood is cut off/stopped.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire with your finger/probe whether there remains any matter from the other small scrofula/swollen glands, then incise them and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, it is necessary then that you do not incise that scrofula at its root. First, it is necessary that you tie it with doubled thread tightly and that you leave it until it falls off by itself without harm/injury.
And then fill the wound with old cotton which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it/dress it.
And if you incise the entire scrofula, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound and sew them immediately as long as there is no superfluity/excess remaining.
But if you see that some superfluity/excess remains due to the size of the scrofula, it is necessary that you try to incise the root of it, and extract it and administer sutures as has been said/described.
And those scrofulas that contain humors, perforate them with a superficial perforation where it appears to you to be the place of its maturation, and place the perforation in the lowest part of the body, as we have said.
And then administer perforation, cauterize with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption/infection. And then when you see the wound is already cleansed, then you treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
On the incision of the hair of the abscess occurring/incident within the throat/gullet.  (The "hair" likely refers to a thin surgical instrument or a type of thread/suture.)
The ancients discussed this incision in the epiglottis/uvula, but no one in our land has seen it done.
And this is the writing/transcription of their discourse/words.
But in men having quinsy/tonsillitis, the removal/extraction of the epiglottis/uvula must be avoided, as no benefit is derived from it because all the veins, including the major ones of the patient, are located there.
But in those who have hot abscesses in the mouth or throat or both ears, when the illness is not in the trachea/windpipe, the incision of the epiglottis/uvula should be used to avoid death, which would be caused by suffocation.
Therefore, when we wish to do this, we should incise the epiglottis/uvula below three or four of its rings/circular ridges, with a small incision, widthwise, between two rings, so that the incision is superficial, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for incision, because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it.
And if the physician is timid/fearful, then he should stretch the neck/throat skin with a hook, and then cut the skin until he reaches the canal/trachea, but avoid the blood vessels if he sees any sign of them.
And then incise superficially as we have described; and the incision of the trachea/windpipe is indicated by the breath which comes out of it along with what is broken off from it, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Then when the swelling/crisis has subsided, at which time perforation is feared, rejoin the two edges of the skin of the wound, and sew only that without the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote flesh growth until it is healed.
And Albucasis said that the summary of the discussion we have recounted is simply that you should see that some of these abscesses/swellings have already obstructed the patient's throat, and the patient is near death, and their breathing is cut off, and some go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe through the site of the wound, somewhat, and be saved from death.
And for this reason they recommend leaving the wound open until the harmful matter of the disease has been consumed/expelled; and its harmfulness lasts for three days; and then they recommend sewing up the wound and treating it until it is healed.
And what I myself have seen is that a maidservant took a knife and put it to her throat and cut with it a part of the trachea/windpipe, and I was called to treat her, and I found her as silent as the dead, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood that had come out of the wound was minimal/slow.
Then I was assured that she had not cut a vein or artery, and the air was coming out of the wound, and I treated her until she was healed.
And nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice, and after a few days she returned to a better state / recovered.
And now I say that in the cutting/incision of the epiglottis there is no danger/fear.
Chapter 44.
On incision/cutting upon a swelling/abscess which occurs on the throat externally, and is called a hernia of the throat/goiter.
This swelling/abscess called a hernia of the throat/goiter is a large swelling similar to the color of the body, and is common in women.
And it is of two kinds, for it is either natural or accidental.
And the natural kind is not appropriate/necessary to treat/cure.
And the accidental kind is of two types, of which one is similar to fatty lumps/nodes, and the other type is similar to a swelling which is caused by a knotting/dilation of an artery, and in that one there is danger/cause for concern. And it is not appropriate to treat/operate on it with iron/a knife except in the one that is small. And you probe it and examine it with your finger, and if you find it similar to fatty nodes, and it is not attached to any of the veins, then you incise it just like the nodes, and remove it with what it contains from the skin and sac/cyst; and if not, then its entire nature is examined, and then treat the area with the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
On the incision/cutting of the types of lumps/nodes.
There are many types of nodes, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division/classification.
And it is necessary that I recount the difference between a node and a growth/protuberance, as it may cause doubt/confusion.
Therefore, I say that with a growth/protuberance there is heat and fever and vehement pains until the boiling/inflammation of the superfluity/excess is calmed; and when putrefaction is complete, then the fever, the pain, and the heat cease.
But with a node there is no heat nor fever nor pain, and take as an example the lipoma/fatty cyst which is in its own sac/cyst.
And it is the same color as the body, and its beginning is like a pea and it forms like a blister, be it larger or smaller, and they [nodes] are of two types, for either they are fatty and contain moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I said in the classification.
Therefore, it is necessary, when you come to the treatment of a node, that you examine/explore it and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument which is called a probe/sound, according as its form will appear in the chapter which is next/follows this one.
And the manner of examining abscesses and all nodes is this: that you take this instrument and insert it in the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you will turn your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin/membrane.
And then spread out your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the probe and consider what has come out in its track/groove.
And if the moisture is ejected in a stream/flowing, whatever color it may be, then you incise it with a superficial incision as I have said about other abscesses.
And if no moisture comes from the track of the probe, then know that it is fat/a fatty tumor.
And cut on it with an incision in the shape of a cross like this: as I have taught you, and lift it with hooks, and peel the skin on all sides with ease, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it and draw out that infected blood with the knot.
But if it is ruptured during the operation, it is not possible to extract that infected blood, and this happens many times, and then you remove it in pieces until nothing of it remains.
Because if any of it remains, little or much, the node will return according to the most/the larger part (that remains).
And if you see that some small part of it remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and bind the wound, and place over it something to absorb the discharge/pus, and treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And if it is a large node/growth, then you sew its two edges/lips and treat it with something that promotes flesh growth.
But if there is a pulsating vein in the opposite direction, or a non-pulsating one, then you must burn and fill the place with ground vitriol and bind it tightly for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood subsides; and then return to incise what remains of the node.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary for incision and perforation.
Of these are the forms of the scalpels, and they are of three kinds: some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of a large scalpel is this:
The shape of a small scalpel is this:
They are made of iron or steel, with suitably squared ends, so that they facilitate entry into abscesses.
And these are the shapes of the probes/lancets, and they are called albereds [possibly a type of surgical instrument], and one of them is called a berid [likely another surgical instrument].
And they are of three types, because of their size: large, medium and small.
The shape of a large probe/lancet, its form:
The shape of a medium probe/lancet, its form:
The shape of a small probe/lancet, its form:
It is fitting that they be used for these abscesses and ulcers and fistulas and buboes, especially those that are among the bones and from other causes.
And they are made round, thick, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of yellow brass, or of brass or of iron, or of silver. And the best are when they are made of yellow brass.
And probes are made of black lead, which are suitable for opening fistulas in the cavities of which there are twists/turns, so that they can be reflected with their flexibility within those twists/turns.
And they are of three kinds, for some of them are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
The form of the large lead probe:
The form of the medium lead probe:
The form of the small lead probe:
The shapes of the hooks are of many kinds, for some of them are simple, having only one curve, and they are of three kinds: large, small and medium.
And of these are sharp hooks, and they are of three kinds.
And of these are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds.
And of these are some having three curves, and they are of three kinds.
And all of these are necessary in their place.
The form of a simple small hook, its shape:
The form of a large hook having two curvatures: The form of a medium hook having two curvatures: The form of a small hook having two curvatures:
The form of a large hook having three curvatures:
The form of a medium hook having three curvatures:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are dried and scraped, and they are of three types, because of them there is large, medium, and small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The ends of these with which the incision is made are sharp and the other ends are blunt, and they are not positioned in such a way, but so that the fear of incising a vein or nerve may be easily avoided in the scraping of the nodes, and by these the patient may be healed and find a little tranquility through the burning which comes after the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the shapes of lancets, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of brass and are similar to a ray with which alcofol is made.  (Note: "alcofol" likely refers to a distilled liquid, possibly alcohol used for medicinal purposes.)
And it has at its pointed end a hidden blade, and in that it runs to the parts inside and outside, when you want, as you see. (This likely describes the retractable blade of the lancet.)
The shapes of blades, which are hidden among the aforementioned, divide [or are used for] the perforation of abscesses, and the patients do not perceive them, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are their shapes:
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes:
Let them be made of yellow copper, round with some length, and let them be thin/fine.
And it is necessary that you have these types of cupping glasses: large, medium, and small, so that with them you may quickly cut off the flow of blood in times of need, even when at first you have no medicine/remedy.
However, do not use them to cut off blood in every part of the body, and use them only in fleshy places, such as in the calves of the legs and thighs, and in the muscles of the arms, and of the breasts and of the belly and of the buttocks, and similar fleshy and moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments are made from these, resembling the peels of figs, according to this form/manner; by which the blood is cut off when it is done by phlebotomy, either by incision of a vein or of an artery.
And sometimes they are made round according to this form/manner:
Chapter 47.
Of the treatment of men's breasts which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the nipples of some men are swollen by the fulfillment of sleep when they begin to be hairy, and then their nipples are swollen, and become similar to the breasts of women, and remain apostematous (infected with pus), ugly.
And to him who has this, it is necessary to incise them with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner, from the line B to the line G, and then excise all the thickness/growth, and then fill the wound with incarnative (flesh-forming) medicine, and then join the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the nipple hangs down and is softened by its size as happens in women, then it should be split on both sides above, with two incisions similar to a crescent moon shape, each of which is contained within the other after the end of each one, so that the larger line contains the smaller one in this way, from line B and line G.  And then excise the flesh which is between the two edges of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about the suture and the powders that are necessary in the treatment until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what should be incised because of the restlessness of the patient, and because of blood flow, then it is necessary that you fill the wound with cotton submerged in corrosive ointment and leave it there until it corrodes what remains of the fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the perforation/lancing of abscesses that come under the armpit/in the axilla.
These abscesses that occur under the armpit are of the type of scrofula, hard, which contain a skin/membrane that is like a sac.
And of these there are some that contain fluids/humidity; and those that contain fluids must be incised with a crescent-shaped incision according to this figure: from the line G to the line B. And when all that is in the abscess of pus/infected matter is evacuated, then you fill it with old cotton/lint and leave it until the next day.
And then the cotton/lint should be removed and it should be treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes/lumps, and of scrofula, then you cut/lance it as we have said in the section on scrofula, in the same way.
But if the plague/infection is spread out so that putrefaction emerges/occurs, then administer cautery to it as we have said previously about this.
Chapter 49.
On the cutting/lancing of abscesses that occur because of an artery or vein.
When an artery is ruptured, and the skin/tissue over it has healed/closed, then many times an abscess occurs. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are due to the artery or vein are these: for when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated in the depth of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a sort of whistling/creaking/crackling sound in it.
And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And cutting/lancing this abscess is a mistake, especially in those that are under the armpits, and in the elbows, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large, therefore its treatment with iron (surgical instruments) must be avoided, and that which is in the extremities, or on the head, should be avoided.
But on that which is there because of swelling of the opening of the artery, you will make a long incision in the skin/tissue; and then open the incision with hooks and [find] the artery, and free it from the membranes/tunics until it is exposed/uncovered.
And then put a needle on it and make it penetrate through to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places,—which procedure I have shown you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
And then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula/blade until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the abscess is dissolved/drained.
And then administer a treatment in which pepper is generated/used until the ligatures fall off; and then treat it with ointments suitable for this until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess due to a cut vein, then you must hold with your hand as much as possible of the abscess along with the skin, and then insert the needle under the area which you have held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it until you pull it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a good ligature as I have told you in the tying of a grape in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you are afraid that the thread will come out, then insert the thread with the needle under the whole abscess near the incision of the first needle, and tie your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in its middle area so that when what is in it has come out, you then cut the excess skin, and leave that which is tied.
And then put on it a powder which you have soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is made with socks/bandages and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter L (50) of the abscess which occurs because of a twisted/sprained nerve.
Just as an abscess occurs in an artery and in a vein, similarly an abscess occurs in the nerves when there is an impact on them or occurs through excessive work, and similar things.
And it is done most often in the areas of the joints or the heel, or in any place in which the joints are strained/moved.
And it is a serious abscess, and it is similar to the color of the other flesh, and it is without notable features/manifestations most of the time, and when it is pressed forcefully, the patient feels a sort of numbness in it.
And the abscess is not joined/fixed to the surrounding flesh, and because of this it is beneath the skin, and it can be moved in every direction and it does not go to the areas in front or behind.
Therefore, those [abscesses] that are in the joints should not be invaded with iron (i.e., surgically treated), for contraction would very easily follow.
But [for] that which is on the head or on the forehead, split the skin with a spatula/spatula-shaped knife. But if it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps and cut it out by the roots.
And if it is large, then you lift it with a hook, and peel/excise it, and then stop/stanch [the bleeding]; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51 (or 50 if using a zero-based numbering system).
On the incision of an abscess which occurs from a hernia that occurs in the belly/abdomen.
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies that growths appear which are called fungals due to their similarity to fungi/mushrooms, whose roots are thin and the head/top of which is large; and sometimes their edges are inverted/turned inward, and there are those that are small, and there are those that are very large/magnified.
And I have seen one, and in his belly there were two growths which were more similar to fungi/mushrooms, and there was no difference between those white ones, of slender roots.
And their edges were inverted/rolled inward and split/cracked, and moisture flowed from it constantly.
Then I incised them and found in one approximately eighteen ounces in weight and the other approximately six ounces.
And the procedure for their incision is that you consider then if the patient is humid/has excess moisture, and the color of the growth is white, moist, of thin roots; then you incise it with a broad spatula/knife, and have cauteries in the fire in your presence, because many times much blood is expelled from its cut; and if blood comes to you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient weak and fearful, refrain from incising with iron/a knife; but then take recently made white lead (lead carbonate), and constrict/bind the growth with it, in the manner which we have described; and leave it for two days.
And next tighten the stricture of the lead wire/thread; then, do not cease tightening the lead a great deal against the growth, until it is severed and falls off by itself without effort/intervention.
But if the growth has thick roots, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and anxiety, and especially in the one that is in the abdomen/belly.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to presume to incise a growth which is dark colored, with little feeling, and of hard consistency/texture, for that one is truly cancerous.
And I will return with a discussion of cancer after this.
Chapter 52.
On the treatment of umbilical hernia/protrusion. (Literally: Of the treatment of eminence of the navel)
An umbilical hernia is caused by many reasons; either by fissures of the peritoneum (ciphhac) which is over the abdomen, and from there the tissues or intestines emerge as occurs in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery as previously stated, or by trapped wind/gas.
But if it is due to a fissure of the peritoneum and protrusion of the tissue, then the color of the swelling is similar to the body's color; and it is smooth without pain, and appears in different locations. And if it is due to a protrusion of the intestine, then the appearance of that is, compared to what we have described, more vehemently different, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and then returns; and it is very sensitive to the touch, and it becomes much larger after bathing and strenuous activity/work.
But if it is caused by fluid/humidity, then it is smooth and is not hidden when pressed with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it make a gurgling sound (crepitus).
And if it is caused by blood, then with these signs the swelling appears, tending toward black.
But if it is caused by dead flesh, then the swelling is heavy, large and hard, and is fixed in one spot/position/size.
But if it is caused by flatulence, then its touch is smooth.
And the procedure for it is that you consider then if the protrusion of the navel is due to blood from an artery, or from a vein, or from flatulence; then you must refrain from treating it, because in that case there is danger and fear, just as I taught you in the chapter in which I discussed swellings/abscesses of arteries and veins.
And if the protrusion of the navel is due to the intestine or the membrane/tissue, then you must order the patient to hold his breath, and stand upright/extended; then probe with a  probe around the entire navel, and then order him to stand facing you between your hands upon his feet, and then wrap broad bandages around the navel over the place you probed; and then extend/pull out half of the swelling upwards with a large hook; and then tie/bind it around with strong thread or silk, and tie it up properly.
And then open the middle of the extended swelling above the binding and insert your finger into that opening and search for the intestine; and if you have found it or secured it with the binding, then you must pull softly/carefully and push the intestine back into the abdomen.
And if you have found the membrane/tissue, then take it with a hook; and cut away its excess/superfluous parts.
But if you encounter an artery or vein, then avoid/go around that area, and then return to your procedure; and take two needles and thread them with strong thread and insert the two needles around the area that you have made around the swelling in the form of a cross, making them penetrate; and then constrict the swelling in four places over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the stretched flesh rots and falls off by itself; or cut it when it has thinned and rotted, and then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the swelling of the navel is from flesh growing there or from moisture/fluid, then you must drain the swelling as we have said and remove the blood or fluid, which you find there, and then treat it with what is necessary and what will strengthen/heal the area.
Chapter 53.
On the treatment of cancer/gangrene. (The word "cranc" could refer to either depending on the context.)
We have already discussed, in the section on types of cancer/gangrene, how it can be treated with medicines, and that treatment with iron (surgical instruments) should be avoided so that it does not ulcerate; and we have discussed cancer/gangrene generated in the breast and precautions for its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer/gangrene is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as cancer/gangrene which is in the breasts or in the thigh and in similar members, [and they recommended] to remove it all, especially when it is small and just beginning.
But when it is old and large, you should not attempt it, for I could not heal any such case, nor have I seen another who has, nor [anyone who] has achieved this.
And the operation, when it is indicated as we have said, is that you should first prepare and bleed the patient and purge him of black bile sometimes, and then bleed him, if a manifest plethora is found.
And then prepare the patient with the appropriate preparation in which surgery is involved, and then insert into the hole hooks which are suitable for it; and then excavate on all sides with the scalpel, carefully searching until no trace of its roots remains. And let the blood flow, and do not stop it lightly, and press the areas, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or with a suitable instrument.
But if you encounter troublesome bleeding from a vein or artery incision, then cauterize it until the flow of blood has ceased, and then treat it with other appropriate treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 54.
On the treatment of dropsy (edema/swelling).
We have already recounted, in the division (of the subject), the types of dropsy/edema caused by water, and the signs of each type, (and) its treatment with medicines.
And the one that is treated with iron (surgical instruments) is only the type called ascites, and  treatment with iron instruments is not applied to tympanites nor to anasarca, because that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines and your treatment is not effective, then consider, for if the patient is already weakened, or has another disease in addition to dropsy, such as a cough or stomach ailment and similar things, then refrain from treating with iron (surgical instruments), because it is dangerous.
But if you see the patient is of robust constitution, and has no other disease but dropsy alone, and is neither a child nor old, then the manner of the operation is that you lift the patient between your hands, and an assistant should press his belly with his hand, pushing the water to the area below the navel, and then take a pointed spatula shaped like this:
It should be long, sharpened on both sides, with a pointed tip like a spatula; but however, let there be a slight, gradual shortness in it, so that during the operation you do not penetrate the intestine with it and injure it.
And then consider if the accumulation of dropsy is on the side of the intestines, for then it is necessary that you distance yourself with the incision from the navel by the amount of three fingers in the area below, to his right, above the groin.
But if the accumulation of dropsy is due to a disease of the liver, then your incision should be three fingers to the left of the navel.
And if the accumulation is caused by the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.
And your incision must not be on the side on which the patient intends to lie, so that the excess fluids do not flow to that cold place.
And then pierce the entire skin with the instrument, and then insert it into that incision, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the peritoneum (abdominal membrane), and you will scrape it; about the size of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then pierce the peritoneum until the spatula reaches the empty space, where the water is. And then remove it and insert an instrument of this shape: and it is similar to a thin silver cannula; it is made of silver or brass or latten, which has a small hole in its lower part, and three holes on its sides: two on one side and one on the other; and its end is sharpened like a pen, as you see:
And at its top end is a small ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, you immediately pull on the instrument via the ring, thus evacuating a moderate amount of the water at a time, for if you evacuate more than necessary at once, the patient may quickly die from the depletion of their animal spirit, or they may suffer syncope, which is near death.
But evacuate it according to the patient's strength and as indicated by the patient's condition, the strength of their pulse, and their general well-being.
And then remove the instrument, and stop the flow of water, which is immediately stopped by the string which blocks the hole above the nape of the neck, which I told you to pierce in that manner.
And then repeat the procedure the next day if you see the patient tolerating it, and remove a small amount of the water, and do this carefully for several days, and beware of making a mistake until only a little of the water remains.
But if you fear for the patient, and leave a large amount of water, then treat them by burying them in hot sand, and frequent sweating in a bath, and waiting in the sun for a long time; and treat them with desiccative medicines until they are healed.
And cauterize over the stomach, spleen, and liver after the extraction of the water, as I have described previously.
Chapter 55.
On the treatment of children born without openings for urine.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb without the opening of its urethra being perforated (or the hole is narrow, or not in its proper place).
Therefore, one must seek to perforate it as soon as it is born with a very subtle probe, in the following manner:
And then place in the hole a thin lead nail and tie it, and keep it for three or four days.
And when it wants to urinate, it should be removed so it can urinate; and then put it back.
And if you don't put the lead in, it is possible that the urine, which goes over the area, will not allow it to close. (Implying: ...will not allow the perforation to remain open/heal properly.)
But one whose opening is narrow should be treated with a lead nail, as we have said, for several days until it is widened/enlarged.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are called hypospadias, which occurs when the opening is located beneath the tip of the penis, so that he cannot urinate downwards, until he lifts the penis with his hand upwards; and he is not able to procreate, because the semen cannot reach the womb directly, and it is a very serious condition.
And the manner of the operation on him is that the patient should be laid on his back, and then stretch the tip of his penis with your left hand using strong traction, and incise the very tip of the penis at the location of the prepuce with a sharp knife, like the cut of a pen, or as if you were shaving away a portion, so that the middle of it becomes similar to the tip of the penis and so that the opening falls in the middle where it should be.
And beware of blood flow during your operation, because this happens often; and stop it by whatever means stops the bleeding, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
About phimosis, which occurs in the prepuce at the tip of the penis and involves corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the prepuce to the glans penis.
This phimosis often occurs in the penis and is a growth of loose flesh.
And of this, one kind is malignant and the other is non-malignant (benign).
For the benign kind, you should lift it with a thin hook and cut it off until it is completely removed; then apply tow soaked in Egyptian ointment; and then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the phimosis is malignant, of a dark/livid color, then you must apply cautery near the incision and its base/root.
But if the phimosis is in the foreskin of the head of an uncircumcised penis, and one part of the phimosis is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you must remove the phimosis that is inside first, until it is healed/firm; and then you treat the outside part, because when you treat it at the same time as the foreskin, there's a risk that it might tear.
And if blackness and decay also occur in the genitals and foreskin, then you must scrape all that has blackened and is decaying or already corrupted; and then spread over it a mixture of honey, ground pomegranate peel, and crushed and sifted orris root (iris).
And then treat it with the other medication until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply lunar caustic (silver nitrate) as follows:
Because beneficial cautery has two uses together, that is for the flow of blood and for the wound when it is infected/decaying.
And if the tip of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you must insert a lead cannula into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans penis (and this adhesion does not happen except in one whose foreskin is intact, and upon whom circumcision is not required; and when adhesion happens from a wound or from an abscess), it is necessary that you scrape with a blunt instrument until the ligament is dissolved and the glans penis is released from every part.
And if it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then you must scrape some part of the glans penis and the foreskin with a blunt instrument, and this is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is very easily perforated due to its thinness.
And then separate between the foreskin and the glans penis with a thin cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then let it be treated with a styptic solution until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
On the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to them from circumcision.
Circumcision is not a break in continuity like other wounds: but rather, since it is of our doing and of our will, and it is performed specifically on children, it is necessary that we assign to it a better and gentler procedure leading to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not discuss circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience, which is why I have found the majority of surgeons and barbers using circumcision and cleansing with a razor and with forceps; and they use binding with bile and incision with the fingernail.
And I have tried all these methods and I did not find better cleansing with forceps, with binding with bile than cleansing with the fingernail, because many times it avoids the skin underneath, since the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is very easily forced to another incision and certain pain. And with the cleansing which is done by a cautery, and is finger-shaped, which cobblers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not safe, because it easily enters its opening.
But in the procedure with the fingernail, you very easily encounter resistance and ruin your work/procedure. And the foreskin of the child is short by nature, and many times it is born in such a way that it does not need cleansing, and I have seen this.
But regarding the cleansing that is done with forceps and binding with bile, experience has revealed its goodness to me, because the forceps are of proportional incision, because the sharpness that is on top is like the sharpness that is underneath; and thus when you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to a comparison at one time; and compression is made by the bile with a figure containing the foreskin of the penis on all sides, with which you completely avoid error.
And the manner of the first procedure is that you have the child—especially if he is one of those who understands a little—held still, so that you do nothing but tie the bile to his penis only, and leave it until the next day.
And then make him happy in every way that you can, in a manner he understands. And then have him held firmly between your hands, and don't hesitate; and hide the forceps in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them, nor any of the other instruments.
And then put your hand to his penis and blow into the foreskin, and pull it back until the head of the penis has emerged, and then cleanse it of any dirt that has accumulated there.
The form of the forceps for cleansing, this is the form:
Let one end be blunt and the other sharp, so that the nail's root is not extracted, and let the length of the two sharp points be equal to the length of the two handles.
But the error in cleansing is that you might too easily remove the inner foreskin, completely, or part of it near the incision.
Therefore it is necessary that you stretch it with your fingernail, away from the swelling of the area, and then incise it evenly.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then draw it out with a hook and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and the swelling remains under the penis after it has become infected, then you leave it until the inflammation subsides, and the skin peels easily, and then incise it as you have been instructed.
And beware of the head of the penis, because that would not be good for it/him. (The pronoun "lu" can refer to both the penis and the patient.)
And then treat it with the consolidating wound powder which we have described in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised from the buttock excessively, and you follow the aforementioned steps, this will not harm it/him. (Again, "lu" likely refers to either the buttock area or the patient.)
And then continue to treat it as we have described until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction due to stone or by clotted blood, or by pus or by flesh, and similar to those [cases] of which we have spoken about the methods of treatment in the [previous] section.
And if [the blockage] is not dissolved with what we have said and the cause is severe for the patient, then you must administer extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form:  Let it be of silver and let it be a thin, hollow tube, like the quill of a bird's feather, with the thinness of a long ray [i.e. thin and long] similar to a palm and a half [in length], to which there is a thin cane at its tip.
And the way to extract the urine with it is that you take a doubled pig's bladder and tie wool or cotton to its end with a good knot; and insert the ends of the bladder into the lower part of the syringe, and cut with scissors if any of the wool is superfluous, but insert it into the tube forcefully.  Then anoint the syringe with butter and egg white.
And have the patient sit on a chair, and rub his bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and rose water.
And then insert the syringe gently until it reaches the root of the penis; then bend the penis up towards the navel; and then push the syringe inside it; and then push it in until it reaches the bladder, and the patient will feel it has reached the empty space, and this isn't done according to this method if the passage has a crookedness/bend.
And then slowly expand the bladder with the wool, because the urine will follow the wool.
Then remove it and apply a dressing to the urinary opening and use the syringe.  Don't stop doing this and use the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
On the method of irrigation/washing of the bladder with forceps and similar instruments that are suitable for this.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or clotted blood, or constricted putrefaction, and you want to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument which is called forceps/clamp, and this is its form:
except that at its tip it is blunt, that is closed. And in it there are three holes: two on one side, as you see.
At the beginning is a concave/hollow place, into which is put that which is injected, and let it be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, until, when something is drawn out with it from the fluids, let it be drawn in, and when it is expelled, with it let it be drawn in, and when it is expelled forcefully, as does forceps with which naphtha/Greek fire is thrown in sea battles.
Therefore when you want to inject fluids into the bladder, insert the tip of the forceps into the liquid, and pull with it that which is pushed to the upper parts, because the liquid is drawn into the concavity of the forceps.
And then insert the tip of the forceps into the penis as we have described for the syringe; and then inject the liquid with that which you inject, because that liquid reaches the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
Form of the thin clyster/enema with which the bladder is clysterized, and this is the form:
And let it be made of silver or tin, of which the highest part/head should be similar to a small feather/quill, and under it a tube/cannula inside with a tie/binding.
And then take a sheep's bladder, and put in it the liquid that you want to administer as a clyster/enema into the bladder, and then tie it between the two with a strong ligature with double thread, and warm that liquid over the fire.
And then insert the tip of the clyster/enema into the penis.
And then squeeze your hand over the bladder with the liquid with downward pressure until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder available, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle of it; and perforate it all around its edge; and then thread a strong string through these holes, so that it is gathered/wrapped; and then tie the circle as one ties a sulphur bag, after you have placed in it what you want of the liquids, and oils, and waters.
And then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, and squeeze it with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of a stone (likely a bladder stone/kidney stone).
We have already discussed in the division the types of stone and its treatment with medicines, and the difference between stone generated in the kidneys and stone generated in the bladder, and the signs of it.
And we have spoken of the stone in which [case] one operates by hand, and incision/cutting.
And the stone generated in the bladder proper is that which is fixed in the bladder.
And I am narrating that with clear explanation and brevity.
Thus I say that stone generated in the bladder occurs mostly in children; and among its signs is that the urine which comes from the bladder is like water in its thinness/clarity, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs their penis, and often it hangs down, and then is erect; and with this, the anus protrudes in many of them/these cases.
And the healing of children from this is easy until they have reached fourteen years; and it is a difficult cure in the old. But in young people it is easier because of that/for this reason, since it is between/among those (ages). / But in young people it's moderately easy because they are between those two ages.
And for the one in whom the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite of that.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment of this, it is necessary at the beginning of it that we cleanse the patient with a clyster which extracts all the filth which is in their bowels/intestines; because that filth sometimes prevents the descent of the stone from being discovered.
And then the patient should be taken by his feet and shaken and moved vigorously so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or that it sometimes jumps from place to another.
And then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the entire bladder is made to incline to the lower parts.
And then search for it and all of that outside/externally.
Then if you feel the stone in the space/area, then immediately prepare yourself with an incision on him/it.
And if you do not completely locate it by your touch, then you must anoint your index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is a fully grown young man, and insert it into his anus/rectum. And search for the stone until it is under your finger. And turn it little by little into the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards towards the place where you made the incision.
And order the assistant to press the bladder with his hand; and order another assistant with his right hand to extend the genitals upwards, and with his other hand to hold back the scrotum which is below the genitals, towards the area where the incision is made.
And then insert a well-sharpened scalpel, of which this is the shape: and cut what is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the side of the left thigh; and the incision should be over that stone and your finger should be in the anus, and make a transverse incision, so that the outer incision is wide and the inner narrow, according to how much protrusion of the stone is possible, and no larger, because your finger, which is in the anus, easily compresses the stone towards the incision, and it is expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones have angles and edges, which makes their extraction difficult.
And of that kind which is like an acorn, and is round, it is easily extracted.
Therefore, if it is one that has angles and edges, insert it into the fissure.
And if it is not thus expelled, then you must be ingenious about it, or you must tighten upon it with a tool, decently, the end of which is like a file with which you tighten upon the stone, and do not let it escape; or insert beneath it a subtle instrument with a curved extremity.
But if you cannot (remove it) thus, then enlarge the hole a little, and if you see a flow of blood, staunch it by applying crushed vitriol.
But if there is more than one stone, then at the beginning you push your hand to the opening of the bladder and then incise upon it; then push it a little toward this (opening); and similarly do if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is ignorance to incise it with a large incision, for one of two things will happen to the patient: either he will die or he will suffer a continuous dripping of urine, because the area is not completely healed.
But continue to push it out until it is expelled, or work at breaking it up with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Then when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with powder of aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that hot swelling may be reduced.
Then lay the patient on their back, and do not undo the bandage until the third day.
And when you have untied it, wash the area with water and a little oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazlicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs a hot, burning, and corrosive swelling, and it appears as if the blood were congealed in the bladder, and because of this urination is impeded (and this is known by the discharge of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it provokes corruption and putrefaction of the bladder.
And then wash the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and with an appropriate remedy for every type, with that which suits it for healing until it is healthy.
And it is necessary during the whole treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medicines that are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the meatus of the penis, and is stuck there, and thus urination is blocked, then treat it with what I recommended before you resort to incision, for too many times incision has been blamed for this condition; and I have already tested this, and that is that you take a perforator of polished iron, of which this is its form:
with a triangular tip, sharp, fixed in wood.
And then take bile, and with that tie the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, perforating easily until the perforator reaches that stone. And turn the perforator with your hand in that stone little by little, and you enlarge its perforation until you make it penetrate to the other side; for the urine is immediately released.
And then press your hand over what remains of the stone on the outside of the penis, for it is broken up, and is cast out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not suitable for you for any reason that prevents it, then tie one thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone. And then cut down on the stone in the penis between the two ligatures. And then remove it. And then untie the ligature and cleanse the congealed blood which is found in the wound.
And the thread ligature below the stone is not necessary, except so that it doesn't return to the bladder, and the other ligature above [is necessary so that] when the thread is untied [after] the removal of the stone, the penis returns to its place and the wound closes.
And for this reason, it is necessary for you, when you tie the thread above, to lift the penis to the upper parts, or that it returns towards your abdomen, and the wound closes as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of stone from women.
Stone is rarely generated in women.
But if a stone appears in any of them, then its treatment is difficult, and prohibited in many ways.
One of them is that the woman is easily ashamed/modest.  (Or possibly "easily embarrassed")
And the second is that you don't find a well-bred woman who will reveal herself to the physician when she is chaste, or is one of the women having husbands.
The third is that you will not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the operation by hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision for a stone in women is far from the location of the stone, therefore you need a deep incision, and in that there is danger/risk.
But if necessity compels you to it, then you must take a well-learned female physician, and she is rarely found.
But if you are deprived of her, then seek a chaste and subtle physician, or employ a well-trained matron skilled in women's matters, or a woman who has learned part of this art through training.
Then have her present, and command her to do everything that you tell her, from the examination for the stone at the beginning; which is that if the woman is a virgin, then she should put her finger in her rectum and search for the stone.
Then if she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and then you order her to incise over it.
But if she is not a virgin, then instruct the matron to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, after she has placed her left hand over the bladder, and compresses it well.
Then if she finds it, she should gradually move it away from the opening of the bladder downwards with the tip of her finger using her utmost skill until it reaches the root of the thigh.
And then incise over that location halfway between the vagina and the root of the thigh on whichever side it is stopped, and feel for the stone in that area, and her finger must not be moved from the stone, holding it underneath.
And the incision should be small at the beginning; and then insert the probe into that incision, and if she feels the stone, then enlarge the incision according to the size that she knows the stone will be extracted from.
And know that there are many kinds of stones: for some of them are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and having branches.
Therefore, you should know how many kinds there are so that you can indicate what you want.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the area and keep it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone is extracted.
And make sure you prepare the instruments that are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you may be helped by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that is incised, then you apply powder to the area and compress it with bandages and a tight dressing, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will very quickly die. And then treat the wound.
Then, when the acuteness of the bleeding has subsided after a few days, and the area can bear it, then you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62. (Capitol is likely a variant spelling of "Capítol," meaning "Chapter")
On the incision/cutting over an inguinal hernia.  (Hernia "acoza" likely refers to a specific type, possibly inguinal given its location near the "coyssas" (thighs) in the previous section.)
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of fluid in the white tunic, which is under the chain/cord of the genitals containing the testicle, and is called a tunic (or membrane).
And sometimes it is in the very membrane which nature has prepared for it in the area of the testicle, so that it looks like there is another testicle; and the spermatic cord is between the white tunic, which we have mentioned, and it is nothing but a swelling.
And the generation of this hernia is by a weakness which occurs in the genitals, because of which this matter is poured into them, and sometimes occurs from a blow made on the genitals.
And this fluid has many colors, for its color either tends towards yellow/citrine, or bloody/sanguine, or red, or is black and fecal-like, or is watery white, and this is what is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white tunic, which we have mentioned, then the abscess/swelling is round, inclining a little to length like the shape of an egg, and surrounds the testicle, for the fluid contains it on all sides.
And if the fluid is in its own membrane, then the swelling is round with part of the testicle and therefore one thinks that it is another testicle.
And if the fluid is between the testicle's cord and the white tunic, then one feels a lump/mass underneath.  (Literally: "then you feel underneath the feeling/lump")
And when you want to know the color of the fluid, then you test the color of the fluid in the swelling with a square instrument, the form of which has been described before; and according to what comes out on the mark of the instrument, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we come to its treatment with iron (a surgical instrument), then it is necessary that we order the patient to be phlebotomized (bled) if this is possible for you, and see that his body is full (of blood - i.e., not anemic).
And then he should be laid on his back on something a little high/raised, and place many cloths under him.
And then sit on his left side, and order the assistant to be on his right, who should extend his staff (rod/instrument) on either side at the testicle's cord and at the area of the abdomen's navel.
And then take a broad spatula and cut the spermatic cord in the middle lengthwise nearly to the pubic bone.
And the incision should be made straight and equally distant from the line that divides the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the surrounding white tunic (membrane).
And peel/scrape it, and observe, and be careful that you do not incise it; and let your scraping, with which you scrape it partially, be suspended from the egg more and subtly rubbed with the scraper according to the amount possible for you.
And then pierce the tunic full of water with a wide perforation/opening, and extract all the water.
And then separate the two lips/edges of the incision with hooks, and extend the membrane/tunic upwards; and do not touch the spermatic cord contained within, and incise/cut the membrane/tunic in the manner that is possible for you. And incise/cut it completely or in pieces, and especially its thin side, because if you do not investigate its incision thoroughly, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the testicle proceeds from that outside of its cord at the time of your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the membrane, return it inside, and then join the two edges of the spermatic cord with a suture, and then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another disease, then you must tie the vessels which are above the suspensory muscle/ligament, and extract the testicle, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the water is collected in two separate places, then know that there are two hernias; therefore incise that part as you have done in the other likewise; and if it seems to you to be one operation, then you do it (as one).
And then you wipe away the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles and the area of the abdomen; and place on top folded cloths and cushions, and bind these over with a bandage which is of this form:
and then two cloths should be taken and filled with carded wool in this manner; and the ends should be made with which it is pressed, of cotton or dampened wool, and they should be fastened tightly in the waistband of the trousers/pants, and one of the ends should take from the buttock to the back, and the second should take to the part of the calf, and two ends under both thighs and two other ends over both groins, and all the fastening should be joined in the waistband of the trousers.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with a cautery instead of incision with iron; and you should take a thin, knife-like cautery and incise with it the scrotum of the testicles, and it is heated as we have described until the white membrane containing the fluid is exposed, and then you take a cautery of this form: and it is similar to a Greek letter.
And then pierce with it the membrane, and it is heated until all the moisture is expelled.
And then stretch the membrane with hooks, and excoriate it with hooks, and excoriate it with a thin, heated cautery; and incise it as much as you can until you eradicate all of it; and be careful of the testicle that the fire does not touch it.
And know that this operation is safer and further from blood flow, and better than operating with an incision.
But if you encounter a problem like a burn during the incision or cauterization, or bleeding, then you must treat whichever problem arises appropriately, with the treatment that suits it as described.
But if the patient is afraid and does not tolerate the second operation because of its dreadfulness, then administer perforation as I have described; and it is when you are certain, by what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is watery/serous.
Then you must have the patient sit on a raised seat/chair, then pierce the abscess at its lowest point with a broad spatula/instrument, and make the perforation along the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough so that all the fluid/water flows out.
Then place cotton over the area and bandage it and leave it, so that the remaining fluid drains. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the drainage of the fluid when you pierce it: and this only happens because the white membrane in the opening of the wound creates resistance and prevents the flow of fluid, then you must insert into the wound a feather or instrument with which fluid is extracted from dropsies, the form of which has been described previously; or insert a small tube into the opening of the wound.
And know that the fluid will return, and will collect again in about six months or thereabouts; and when it has collected, then it should be pierced in the same manner, for thus the patient will spend his days.
Chapter 63.
On the incision of a fleshy hernia and its treatment/cure.
Know that incising this hernia is dangerously risky in most cases; therefore, it seems best to me to leave it alone and for the patient to be saved by this (method).
And I am recalling the operation on it and the types of abscesses/swellings.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the bodies from which the genitals are composed, and this happens for many reasons: either from an acute, severe excess (of humor), which spreads to the genitals, or from an injury/impact.
And the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and there is no pain found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And it easily becomes a hardened/stone-like abscess, the color of which is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by knotting/obstruction of the arteries, and by their swelling, as has already been mentioned, or by swelling of the veins.
But that which is caused by swelling of the arteries is recognized by the dispersal of the abscess when you compress it with your fingers; and it must not be touched (further/otherwise).
But that which is caused by the swelling of a vein is not dispersed at all by compression with the fingers.
And it is indeed possible that an incision can be made upon this type as upon other flesh; which is that you incise the spermatic cord, and then extend the testicle to the upper parts, and extract it from the white membrane (tunica albuginea?), and free the suspensory ligament of the vessels, and tie them off, and then incise the suspensory ligament after you have freed it completely from all parts of the testicle.
Then, if the testicle is consolidated with this fleshy growth, it is necessary that you extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between any part of the membrane, or between that which is among the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all of that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a fleshy growth in the place of the adhesion, which is behind it, then it is necessary that you incise all of that which is there, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Then, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia. (Literally: Of the treatment of hernia that is of the intestines.)
A hernia is a swelling surrounded by a kind of wrapping similar to new growth with softening of the testicles, and it makes exercise and walking difficult for the patient.
And the treatment of this disease is dangerous for the reason previously mentioned.  (Implying it refers to a previously mentioned danger/difficulty).
However, I must describe the procedure as performed by earlier practitioners. (Or "the ancients/predecessors").
And I say that you must have the patient sit on a raised chair/seat; and then you push the suspensory [muscles/ligaments] of the testicles downwards; and then you hold the penis with your fingers at the base, which is next to the groin; and let another assistant, besides yourself, hold it and extend it forcefully.
And then you incise with a sharp, broad scalpel/knife via a transverse incision to the right of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then peel/remove the skin from all sides as we have described in the removal of arteries, which are in the temples.
And then insert into them a needle with a double thread, and tie it [the thread] at the front of the location where you made the incision, and tie it again at the back of them [the vessels]. And then incise them [the vessels] in the middle with a straight incision along the length of the body, and remove what is collected of the putrid and corrupt humors/fluids.
And then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which you want healthy flesh to be generated so that the vessels that nourish one of the two genitals fall away, for there is no harm in this.
But if you happen to cut all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed, or that the testicles consequently dry up/wither along with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels and are shriveled up, or that they dry up so that there is no function/use with them.
Chapter 65.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a tear that happens in the peritoneum stretched over the abdomen on the side near the groin/angles of the abdominal wall,  through which the intestines descend from that rupture towards the scrotum.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or from its distension, and these two types occur for many reasons: either from a blow/impact, or from jumps/leaps, or from shouting, or from lifting something heavy, or similar things.
And the sign of this, when it is from distension of the peritoneum, is that it happens little by little over a long time, and doesn't happen suddenly, and there is swelling around the groin because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is from a tear of the peritoneum, is that at the beginning it causes sudden, intense pain; and there is a distinct swelling apparent below the groin/ligament appearing suddenly, and this is due to the exit of the intestine, and its mass appearing outside of the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum is expelled along with the intestine, and this hernia is called intestinal zirbal (likely referring to a specific type of hernia involving both the intestine and omentum).
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes a tear/fissure occurs in the intestine, and here it is retained, and with this there is great danger/peril for the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of the types of this disease with iron there is danger/risk, therefore the use of it in that (treatment) should be avoided.
And the method of operating on it is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand to the area within its cavity if it obeys his manipulation, and then it should be rolled/massaged on its neck between your hands, and elevate his legs.
And then tighten the cord, which follows the spermatic cord to the upper parts, and incise the spermatic cord completely lengthwise; and then insert hooks into the two lips of the incision as needed to open the incision with them.
And make the incision as large as possible so that the testicle can be expelled/removed from it.
And then peel/remove the membranes which are under the spermatic cord, until the hard white membrane is exposed on each side.
Then insert your finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white membrane, which is under the spermatic cord, and between the second membrane, and release with it the adhesion that is at the back part of the testicle.
And then pull the spermatic cord outward with your hand, and with this extend the white membrane upward with your left hand, and lift the testicle with the membrane toward the incision; and order the assistant to extend the testicle upwards and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind with complete loosening/separation.
And search with your fingers that there is no part of the intestine wrapped/caught in the hard white membrane (tunica albuginea). But if you find any part of it there, then you push it back into the abdomen below.
And then make an incision in the part below the spermatic cord through which blood will flow and will thus be purged, as we have related in what we have said.
And then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and apply the bandage that we have described (and sometimes the white membrane, which we mentioned, is cauterized near the incision for fear of blood flow, because it often happens) and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then it should be fomented with warm water, and [the water] placed on it until it falls off as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other treatment for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of wind hernia / Of pneumatocele /  Of gas hernia (A pneumatocele is a hernia filled with air or gas).
In this hernia, I have not seen anyone be bold with its treatment using iron (instruments/surgery).
And the first ones (physicians/authors) said that it is done as we have recounted in the hernia that is with veins/vessels; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision upon it with ease; and then dry the middle area around the abscess with that which opens it, until the vessels fall off.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture/hernia that occurs in the groins.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groins as we have said, and elevate the area.
And do not allow any part of the intestines to descend to the genitals; and if they do, it is a small amount; and it returns in all hours/frequently.
But if the time is prolonged with this, a fissure is added in the scrotum until the intestine descends into the scrotum; and this happens because of the extension of the scrotum which is in the groins as we have said, the reason being that the scrotum is extended, and then softened and the area becomes abscessed and swells.
And its treatment is with a cautery as was described in the preceding narrative.
And sometimes it is treated with iron in this manner: the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then dry the location of the rupture of the swollen abscesses with a cut along its width to the size of three fingers.
And then tighten the white tunic (membrane) that is under the skin until it is exposed/uncovered.
And then take the root (or possibly a ray/beam - context needed) and place it on the protruding part of the scrotum and press it against the front of the abdomen/belly.
And then sew the two protruding parts on the edge of the root/ray of the tunic/membrane, joining one to the other with the suture.
And then remove the end of the root/ray, and do not cut the tunic/membrane completely, nor extend the testicle, or anything else as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment of wounds, and as you would incise hemorrhoids, clean it and restore the wound until it is healed; because the tunic/membrane is contracted and the protrusion of the rupture is not adjusted/reduced.
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to a cure/healing.
Chapter 68.
On softening the hardness/swelling of the testicles.
Many times the hardness/swelling of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh between them is softened, and his appearance is made ugly/unsightly.
Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat him to have the patient lie on his back, and then cut out all the hardened/swollen part which is softened above the natural testicle; and then join the two edges/lips with sutures.
And if you wish, sew in the beginning the excess of the softened hardened/swollen part with three or four stitches and with a firm suture.
And then cut between the sutures; and then treat it by the method of treating other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69.
On castration.
Know that castration is excommunicated in our law, but for a reason it is permitted to me that I mention it in this book; and the mention of it is necessary only in two ways, one of which is so that this may be in the knowledge of the physician when he is asked about it, that he may know the treatment of the one to whom it happens; and the other way is that we often have need of castration of other beasts for our benefit from them, such as monkeys, goats, pigs, and similar animals.
And so I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by cutting with an incision.
But in that which is done by crushing, the way of the operation is that we make the beast sit in hot water until its genitals are softened and loose and hanging down. And then take them with your hand until they are dissolved and no longer apparent to the touch.
But in castration done by incision and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the beast and squeeze the cord of its testicles with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory muscle, and make an incision over each testicle with a single cut until both testicles come out.
And then cut them after you have skinned each one. And don't leave anything on the surface of the wound, except the thin membrane which is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than the one done by crushing, because crushing very easily leaves some testicular tissue, which causes the beast to still desire mating.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
About the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when there appears in what would be the space in the scrotum, in the area between the two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva, in which there is hair.
And sometimes urine flows from this [opening] which is in the scrotum.
But in women, there is one type: the woman's vulva, above the pubic bone, is like two testicles of a man, somewhat diminished all around the outside, resembling the foreskin of a man and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three kinds: two for men and one kind for women. And it is necessary that you excise those excess/joined  fleshes, so that the swelling of the area disappears, and then treat them with the treatment for other wounds/sores.
And in the second type in men, from which urine flows, which is in the scrotum, there is no treatment or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
About swelling and protruding flesh caused by women.
Swelling occurs easily due to natural causes until it is stretched and becomes light in appearance; and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much so that it spreads just as it does in men and prevents intercourse.
Therefore, you must hold the excess swelling with your hand or with a hook and incise it.
And do not go deep in the incision, especially near the root, so that it does not cause a flow of blood.
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds until it is healed.
Excess flesh is flesh that grows in the mother's womb, filling it up, and easily protrudes outwards in the shape of a tail (and because of this some early writers called this "tailed disease"); therefore, we must incise it just as we incise swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of arthritis/gout (alratica seems to be a variant spelling referring to a condition related to joint pain).
Arthritis/gout (alratica) occurs when the woman's vagina is not perforated, or the opening is too small. And it is either natural or accidental/acquired.
Accidental/acquired is due to a preceding illness, and this is caused either by excess flesh growth or by a thin or thick membrane/film.
And it is located either in the mother's vulva, or on its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part, and it prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and very easily obstructs menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by examination by a midwife, if the blockage is visible, it's near the entrance; but if it is not visible, then you search for it with your fingers or with a probe/instrument.
But if the blockage is caused by a thin membrane/film and is close to the labia, then you cut and rupture it.
And you should apply powders to both labia, and then place your index fingers from both hands together/inside.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and then spread the labia forcefully until that thin membrane/film is ruptured and the blockage is opened.
And then take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the area, and lie with a man daily so that the incised area does not close/heal over.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you need to incise it with a broad-bladed instrument or with a myrtle leaf.  (Note: "spatum lat" likely refers to some kind of surgical instrument, perhaps a spatula-like knife.)
But if the blockage is due to flesh/excess tissue, then lift it with a hook, and incise/cut it.
And you should have medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting/cauterizing, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and incense, mixed with egg white.
And then insert a wide lead cannula so that the wound isn't closed prematurely/easily.
And keep it (the cannula) in for a few days and administer some drying medications.
And then it should be treated with another healing treatment until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the afterbirth of other flesh (tissues), and then it is necessary to cut in this manner. But if this is due to cancerous abscess, the cancerous abscess which is in the afterbirth should not be opposed with iron (surgical instruments) in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids, and of fissures, and of red swelling that occurs in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are swellings of the orifices of many veins from which much blood flows continuously; and when they are old hemorrhoids, they become hard. (lit: "they are made/become hard.")
And I have already described in the division [earlier section] the types of these and their signs, and I will [now] say here which ones receive treatment and which ones do not receive treatment.
Therefore, I say that when hemorrhoids and hard lumps are in the anus and are not noticeable (lit: "do not appear to the feeling/sense"), then these should not be treated with iron (surgery).
But those which are at the opening of the anus, which are felt/palpable, are those that are treated.
And you need to put the woman in a cold place and then stretch out the pile with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them out at the roots.
And then sprinkle on them some blood-stopping powder, one of the non-corrosive/biting powders, such as acacia and similar ones.
And then wrap her feet for an hour, and then place her in cold water.
And if the bleeding continues, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate rinds and gallnuts and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with this on his/her back.
And if the bleeding is stopped, good; and if not, apply two suction cups, and to the breasts without scarification/incision.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or in plantain juice or in clary juice with spoiled wine and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
On perforation/fistula of an abscess/ulcer occurring in the breast.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the breast, such as cancer and hardened abscess and ulcerations and painful swellings and herpes and fistulas, hemorrhoids and fissures and styes and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these diseases and their types and their signs, and their treatments in the (relevant) section/chapter.
And it is fitting that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the breast when it is one of those abscesses that collect pus, and if you want to know how its operation is performed with an instrument.
Therefore, you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is acute with throbbing and phlegm and fever, and you see it redden, and if you feel a sensation of heat on it, then do not attempt its perforation, and treat it with that which helps its maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
And then you must have the woman sit on a chair that has two cushions; and she should recline on her back and bring her feet closer to the lower part of her abdomen, and her thighs should be spread, and place her arms below her buttocks, and tie each one with a suitable bandage for this purpose.
And then the midwife should sit on the right side and administer the instrument with which the opening of the breast is opened, the form of which will be described in those things that will be done later/next.
And it is necessary when you want to use this instrument that you insert the nipple of the woman's breast with the tip, and that which of the instrument has entered the breast should not be more than the nipple of the breast and [should not] hurt the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the nipple of the breast, then you must place cushions/pads on the surface of the nipple of the breast so that the entry of the whole instrument into the nipple of the breast is prevented.
And you must place the screw that runs in the instrument on the upper side and the [one who] administers it should hold the instrument and turn the screw until the opening of the breast/nipple is opened/dilated.
And when the discharge appears, and is touched with the hand and is watery and soft, then you must wipe it from around the patient's head with a soft cloth/sponge.
And when the blood is evacuated, then you must place in the wound a wick soaked in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the compress/bandage on the incision in the nipple of the breast.
And place outside the breast and over the dressing clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then it should be treated for about two days with an ointment that is suitable for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the breast and the wound are washed, as if baptized, with water and honey, and then with water in which the root of lily or long birthwort has been boiled, and then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep inside the breast itself, then you must refrain from treating it with iron (surgical instruments), treating it instead with what we have said in the section/chapter.
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives how to treat living embryos when they are in an unnatural position/presentation.
It is necessary for the midwife to recognize at the outset the natural presentation of the birth by its signs.  And that is when you see the woman pushing downwards, and desiring to breathe fresh air, and moreover is relieved by what is on top of her (presumably pressure from the fetus), and hastens the exit of the embryo, then you should know that this birth is in the natural position. This is when the exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it, either attached or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Therefore, when you see these signs, then the belly should be compressed so that the embryo descends easily, for when it descends head first, the afterbirth comes with it, and she (the mother) is cleansed of those superfluities with good purification/cleansing.
But any other presentation than this is unnatural and undesirable. For when the embryo comes out feet first, and its body has come out before its head and its feet, or one of its hands is by its foot, or its head has come out and its hand, or its belly, and it is quickly turned onto its neck, such and similar presentations are undesirable.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and skilled in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing every presentation of these, and what the trick is in these, so that it may be understood by this and be acted upon accordingly.
When the fetus comes out head first by a natural birth, and it is difficult for the woman and the birth is hard for her, and you see her strength weakened, then have her sit, or have the women hold her, and bathe her vulva with cooked fenugreek and with moistening oils.
And then the midwife should insert a small spatula between her fingers and cut the afterbirth with it, or tear it with her fingernail until the fluid that is in it flows out. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it doesn't descend, then the woman needs to be given an enema of psyllium mucilage and fenugreek mucilage with sesame.
And after the enema, tell her to strain and make her sneeze with condiments (or spices); and cover her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
And if both hands of the fetus are presented first, then you should gently push them back little by little. But if they do not go back in, then place the woman on a chair and raise her feet, and then shake the chair on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she doesn't fall during the shaking.
And if the hands are not returned inside and the fetus dies, then cut them off and extract the rest of the fetus or tie the body to his hand with cloth and extract it evenly, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus comes feet first, then you must push them upward, and then turn the fetus slightly, and then straighten it, and then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
But when it has come out up to the thighs, then you order her to push, and make her sneeze with a sternutatory, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have described, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it in the normal position, for it will then be expelled with an easy delivery.
And if it is still obstructed after all that we have described, then take mucilage of marshmallow and dissolved gum, and pound them together in the mortar with good pounding, and then anoint the vulva of the woman and the lower part of her abdomen with it. And then make her sit in warm water, up to her hypochondria (ribs/upper abdomen).
And when you see that her lower parts are softened, then make a fumigation of myrtle and apply it to her. And when you have applied the fumigation for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and then make her sneeze and close her mouth, and lift her up, and press the lower part of her abdomen with light compression, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
Likewise for a fetus lying sideways, hanging by one of its hands. Be ingenious in reducing its hand, but if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then have her lie on the bed, and shake her thighs with a vehement shaking, and then administer the remedies which I have recounted, made of mucilages.
And if the birth has started, then make her sit on a birthing stool, and then focus on the reduction of the hand, and rock the fetus according to the natural position, and make the woman sneeze and tell her to push until it is delivered.
Likewise for the fetus lying on its neck with its hands spread out, and its face is towards its mother's back. It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and then turn it little by little, and deliver it with ease.
And when it is rocking/in motion, then apply to its vulva what we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then tell her to push little by little, and when you have done this, then have her sit on a birthing stool and tell her to lean on her right side, and then tell her to bear down/push; and make her sneeze with spices/a sneezing agent. Delivery of the prepared fetus onto its side.
When they come out horrifically from the mother in this way, examine (it), and then you incise the afterbirth with your fingernail until the fluid is evacuated.
And if the fetus is wrapped around its face and neck, then you cut it from the navel so that it is not constricted and dies.
And then push the fetus to the inside parts until you position it as it should be, and tell the woman to push/bear down several times, and it will be expelled with such ease, God willing.
Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born, but this is strange and rarely happens; but they are usually stillborn, not alive.
And within these, be it twins or more, is a single afterbirth (placenta), and they are separated by a membrane, which separates the ligaments in the navel of each of them.  And sometimes they are delivered just as easily as a single fetus, by such a natural ease, and they are sometimes born in a more problematic way, as we have described.
And if any of them are difficult to deliver and come in what we have called unnatural presentations, then you treat them as we have described.
And let the midwife be subtle and do this with ease and subtly, and with patience, and be ingenious according to each presentation, according to what is prepared for her by her wit, leading to a successful outcome.
Remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is miscarried.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even more than ten are formed in the mother, and it has been verified by me that one woman miscarried and delivered six, and another ten, all formed, which fact was established by the measurement of the glorious learned men.
And all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife, for very easily such a thing might appear to her, and then she should address it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have said in the section on medical treatment and it has not come out, and you are forced to use a manual operation, then you must consider whether the woman is of sound constitution and not suffering from any of the conditions for which loss is feared.
Then the woman should be turned over on the bed onto her back, and her head should be inclined downwards and her thighs raised.
And the assistant should hold her on both sides or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not extend itself during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you moisten the mother's vulva with humid oils and mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the womb, and then search with her hand for a place in which to fix the hooks into the fetus.
And finding a suitable place for this: then you consider if the fetus is positioned head-down, and then you fix the hooks in its eyes, or in the neck, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or under the chin, or in its collarbone, or in the places near the ribs, or under the hypochondria (area below the ribs).
But if the descent is feet-first, then in the groin, or in the middle of the ribs.
And it is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand, and place its curve in the place which is between the fingers of the left hand, and insert the hand gently and fix the hook in any of those places which we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space (presumably the uterus).
And then place and fix in opposition to it another hook, or a third if necessary, so that the pull is equal, and there is no extension along its straight line only.
But rather it should be moved in every direction, so that its extraction is eased just as is done with a tooth during its removal/extraction.
And it is necessary in this that the tension between them be softened/reduced; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some of her fingers with oil and insert them cautiously and rotate/turn with them that which is retained.
Then if part of the fetus is expelled, then the hooks should be moved to a place that is higher up; and do this until all of the fetus is expelled.
But if one hand has come out before the other, and it is not possible to return it due to its constriction/contraction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then extract it until it is completely expelled, and cut it either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.
And thus you should do with the other hand and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or it suffers constriction in the birth canal, or there is fluid accumulated in its head, then it is necessary to insert a sharp spatula between the said bones and split the head and extract the fluid, or to crush it with an instrument which is called "alundat", the form of which will come with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is next to this one.
And similarly do so if the fetus is naturally large-headed: and then it is necessary to incise it with a pointed instrument, or take it with a hook as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head has come out and is constricted below the wishbone/clavicle, then let it be cut so that the fluid which is in the feet is drained.
But if it is not complicated, nor does it obey extraction, then you shall immediately incise the head as best you can.
And if the lower part of the belly is infected with an abscess or has dropsy, then it is necessary that you pierce it so that the fluid within it drains.
But if the fetus is positioned feet first, then its extraction is easy and its direction to the mouth of the womb is easy/straightforward.
But if it is constricted below the belly and the foot, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you will have wrapped around your hand, and that you cut the belly and the foot so that what is in them drains out.
But if the other limbs are removed and the head remains, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mouth of the womb is open, then she inserts her hand into the birth canal, and searches with it for the head, and draws it with the fingers to the mouth of the womb, and then inserts into it one hook, or two hooks, and pulls it with these.
And if the mouth of the womb is narrowed by a hot swelling which occurs in it, then it is necessary that it not be worked upon; rather, it is necessary then to administer an infusion of moist, fatty substances. And administer poultices/plasters; and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible, it should be turned: and what we have said about the live fetus should be administered.
And if this is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you not leave anything inside of the afterbirth (or placenta).
And when you have completed all of your work, then administer what we have said about the treatment of hot abscesses which occur in the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then you should use styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose womb a dead fetus was, and then on top of that fetus she became pregnant again, and then the other fetus also died. It happened to someone that after a long time an abscess formed in their navel; and it swelled until it opened, and it began to discharge pus (or matter from the arm - less likely given the context).
And I was called to treat him, and medicated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied on him some strongly drawing plasters, and a bone came out of him, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was very surprised, as there are no bones in the belly (in that area).
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead fetus.
So I investigated the wound, and extracted many bones from it, the woman being in thousands of difficult situations [positions/childbirth pains?], and yet lived in such a manner for a long time, a little pus still running from it.
And I do not affirm this to be strange, but rather that in this there is science and help in what the skillful physician administers with his hand for healing.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of hook with which the mother [womb/uterus] is opened:
This is the form of a clamp in which the labia are held, to which holding are two hooks at two ends of two shafts. But this hook must be more subtle than a constrictor, and be made of ivory or boxwood.
And let the width of each shaft be two fingers and the edge of each one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two shafts are two fittings of the same wood that are already fixed, the length of which is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb so that it may be opened with them when you turn the two prescribed hooks.
Another similar form, more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of ivory or boxwood shafts in the likeness of forceps. But however, at its extremity there are two additions as you see, and the length of these additions is about a palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the womb with these, then have the woman lie on the bed with her feet hanging, [with] the space between her thighs open. And then open your hand with the instrument just as you do evenly with forceps, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the womb until the midwife does what you want.
The form of vertigo, which the ancients described:
A method of impulsion with which the fetus is pushed:
A method of reduction with which a large head is constrained/reduced.
And it is similar to forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you see, and sometimes it is made long like forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like a saw's teeth, with which it is incised and constrained/held. A method of slight/small reduction:
Form of a hook having a spine/point:
Form of a hook having two spines/points:
Form of a spatula having two extremities with which the head is cut off.
Form of two broad spatulas.
All these instruments are practiced/used, and the more the types of these are multiplied and prepared by the artificers/craftsmen, the easier it is for their operation and the more highly they are regarded by men due to their quantity/availability.
And do not neglect to prepare any of these instruments, for the need for them is unavoidable/inexcusable (i.e., you must have them).
On the extraction of the afterbirth (or placenta).
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you must order the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with pepper, and tightly close your hand over her mouth and over her nostrils, and if by this means it is expelled, it is good.
And if not, then you take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid and place in it herbs that open the mother's womb, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, gum arabic, cassia bark, and centaury. All these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water in the pot, and place it on the fire.
And then place a reed pipe in the patient's womb, and hold it there until the steam comes to the womb's cavity.  (Note: "mother" here likely means womb, as in referring to the source of the issue)
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains and it (the afterbirth) hasn't come out, then you instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage, and then insert it into the vulva and search with it for the afterbirth, and when she has found it, then take it and draw it out little by little.  But if it is attached to the lining of the womb, then insert her hand as we have described, and when she has found the afterbirth, extract it bit by bit as instructed so that the womb doesn't tear due to forceful pulling. Before, it is necessary that it be moved to the right and left sides with ease.
And if the opening of the womb is constricted, we have already described the treatment with sneezing and the medicinal application of herbal oil.
But if it is not expelled with all the methods that we have described, then take care not to exert yourself with repeated attempts at extraction, but rather it is necessary that what has come out of it to the opening of the womb be tied to the woman's thigh, and then anoint it with ointment and tetrapharmacum; for this will cause it to rot within a few days and it will be dissolved and expelled.
But when it rots, a bad odor rises from it to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and therefore suitable fumigations should be administered for this.
But some of the Ancients have also tried fumigation with dead nettle and dried figs.
Form of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and the afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or bronze.
And the narrow end should be placed in the vulva and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation material placed on the embers of the fire.
And keep it there until the fumigation material is consumed, and then repeat with another.
Treatment of an imperforate anus in an infant.
Many children are born without an anal opening, and their anus is thin and closed/sealed. Then the midwife must perforate that membrane with her finger; or else, perforate it with a sharp instrument, taking care not to touch the surrounding tissue/muscle.  (The word "lacert" likely refers to muscle or flesh near the anus that should be avoided).
Then place on it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will close up again, then place a cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child needs to defecate.
And sometimes blockage of the anus occurs due to the hardening/scarring of a plague sore or abscess; then it is necessary that this hardened tissue be incised, and then be treated as we have said regarding the treatment and lead (treatment).  (The "lead" here might refer to a lead instrument or a lead-based ointment, details are unclear from this sentence alone.)
On the treatment of fistulas that occur near the anus. (Or perhaps more broadly, "below/in the lower body")
Fistulas that occur in the lowermost parts are swellings and lumps which occur near the anus externally or in the perineal space.
And it is one fistula or many.
And when this swelling is old, and a watery white fluid or thin pus flows from it, some of these fistulas sometimes penetrate (deeper tissues).
And these penetrating ones are recognized because there is discharge and flatulence from them; and sometimes the patient suffers from the discharge, and worms often emerge from them.
And some of these fistulas sometimes penetrate into the bladder in the perineum, and into the urethra; and some of them penetrate into the hip joint and into the hollow of the buttock.
And how a fistula penetrating into the anus is distinguished from a non-penetrating one is that you put your index finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity (or winding path).
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger (in the rectum).
And if you do not feel it at all and no discharge, worms, or flatulence comes out of the opening, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then proceed with the treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the urethra, the sign of it is a discharge of urine from it and the prevention of this so that the area may be healed with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the hip joint or into the bone and causes pain in the surrounding area, then the sign of it is that the probe goes in there if there is no tortuosity to the bone, and (there is) increased pain in the area surrounding the part; and that pus constantly comes out of it; and that medication is of no use in it, nor is it healed with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure, and the treatment of these is work and vanity for the foolish physicians who are fixated on it/them.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for according to what I will explain to you, and what I have already tried.
And the patient lies between your hands on their back and raises their legs up, their thighs bent towards their stomach, and then insert a lead probe, or of bronze if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe reaches.
And if the patient feels it around the anus/rectum, then you must insert your index finger into the anus/rectum.
And if you feel in your finger the now uncovered probe penetrating by itself, other than what you feel between your finger and that siphac (membrane/tissue) or flesh, then know for certain that it is penetrating; and then do not work on it, for there is no healing in that, as we have said.
But however, some say that it is healed in some men late/slowly.
And the medication by which healing is hoped for in him is that you ignite a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been described before, and insert this ignited cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus/rectum; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those fistulous attached tissues, which resemble the shaft of a bird's feather, have been cauterized.
And then treat it with compresses soaked in butter until all those cauterized tissues come out, and then treat it with medicines that generate and consolidate flesh, and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it is not healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate all the way to your finger which is in the anus/rectum, and between your finger and the probe there is a thick veil of flesh or membrane, and you see the fistula in such a way that the surface of the intestine is dry, then dry the intestine from the beginning of the fistula, and dry it with the probe, letting it be in the fistula until the dried area reaches the place where the end of the probe reaches, and through the probe, it (the fistula) is freed and evacuated/drained.
And then clean those fistulous tissues, which are similar to the shaft of a bird's feather, and let nothing of them remain.
But if you see a flow of blood that comes between you and your work when you cauterize those tissues, then the best and easiest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterizing with fire combines two good properties: that is, cauterization of those attached tissues, and stopping of the blood [and] drying of the humors.
And then treat it with compresses soaked in butter or crushed cabbage until the area produces pus, and then at that time treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate hard flesh.
And these are medicines in which there are astringent and drying properties; when it is thus restored, it is healed and you do not fear recurrence/relapse.
But if the fistula already reaches into the depth/rectum of the anus and is elongated from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with that.
And then if you feel the probe and between you and it there is a thin membrane or flesh, and it is close to penetration, at that time there is no treatment for him except by way of faith and hope.
This can be administered in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or dry it until you reach its cavity so that it is possible for you to insert the necessary medicines and the appropriate treatment; and do not proceed much with cutting so that you do not incise the muscle containing the anus/rectum, and thus involuntary defecation happens to the patient; and then treat it with what we have said for it will be healed very quickly; or stretch that membrane and clean it after you dry it near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or another sharp-ended instrument, and then clean those fistulous tissues that are in the incision as far as you can by scraping; and then endeavor to make the restoration of the whole wound by cutting, and if the upper orifice is not consolidated/closed, and the fistula remains open in the area of the anus, it will be easier afterwards for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is treated in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is at the side of the anus, around the surface of the body with the buttock [or perhaps *along* the surface of the body towards the buttock] and at the margin of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle for preparing leather/hides [cuirs/skins] in this manner:
and insert into it thread wrapped in five threads or around them; and then insert a probe with thread into the fistula until it reaches its cavity/depth.
But if it penetrates the margin of the anus from the inside, then you pull the thread out of that hole so that you insert your finger into the anus; and pull out the end of the thread and tie the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it for a day or two, and then repeatedly cut the thread into the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues that are between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall off.
And then treat the wound until it is closed and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it be deep in the perineum, because it is not up to you to do this so that you do not cut the muscle; and then continue with that until it is healed.
The form of a thorn-shaped spatula with which the fistula is opened: the curvature of which is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as you sometimes do.
On suturing hemorrhoids from which blood flows in their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, for either they are located between the buttocks resembling embers/coals, or they are like grape seeds. And of these, some are small and large, and blood flows from them constantly, and there is one, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its edges.
But however those that are outside the anus are according to the limbs of little humidity, from which flows a light yellow water or a little blood with a continuous scab/crust, and are according to the color of the body/skin.
And the treatment for the one that is inside the anus is that you order the patient to sit down and strain until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then cover yourself and lift them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, and then cut them down to their roots.
But if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture and softness, then grasp them with a rough cloth or with cotton or with a woolen bandage, and extract them with your fingers, and then cut them and sprinkle on them some hot powders near the incision, so that they act on them in place of a cautery; or cauterize them as described previously in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey and protrude, then give the patient an enema with a small bite (irritant), and let it be washed with that water which is in the anus so that it obeys and protrudes easily when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is minor, and you should take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And the one that you have incised, you must administer sutures to them in this manner: take wrapped thread and insert it into a needle and then draw the hemorrhoids to the upper parts, and make it penetrate with the needle into the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lowest part of the needle, and laterally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong tightening, and then knot the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all of them, and leave one of them and do not sew it, so that the excess blood flows from it.
And then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or ointment on the anus; and place it on the backside and tell the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat them with ointments or other treatment until it is healed.
And when they are old and medicine is not effective, then you must scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are made moist and the pus crust on top is removed, which prevents them from healing; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then you scrape them more vehemently than the first time until they bleed a lot and are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that a whitlow, that is a nail abscess, is nothing but a round lump, the color of flesh, resembling the head of a small nail, and it occurs throughout the body, and mostly on the parts under the feet and on the fingers, and therefore causes excruciating pain.
And then it must be incised around the nail, and held with forceps or a hook, and eradicated from its root; and then treat it.
And if you wish, cauterize it as described in its chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, round, and callous eminence on the surface of the body, and many times it comes on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to stretch and incise it, or to constrict it with a thread or skin until it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or a sharp medicine.
But a "formica" (ant bite/boil) is a small, felted or callous, large eminence on the surface of the body, occurring frequently on the penis, and when the cold encounters it, it is felt there like the bite of an ant, and is found around the body.
And its treatment is that you take a tube of a goose feather or a vulture feather, and let it be strong, and place it on the formica so that the circle of the tube contains its edges; and then turn your hand with the tube until you incise what is within the circumference of the formica, and place it within the substance of the flesh, and eradicate the formica from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of copper or iron according to this method:
Let the upper part of the tube be drawn to a point, blunt (that is, not perforated), enveloped so that the apprentice's grip on it is facilitated, as is its rotation.
And if you wish, cauterize the formica as was previously described in the cauterization of a "atheil" in the chapter on cautery.
On the form of the instruments that are used to give an enema. (Cristeri likely refers to an enema or clyster)
Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or brass, or cast or hammered copper; and sometimes it is made from these instruments small and large according to those to whom they are administered, for the one that is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose rectums are fragile or painful, their enemas should be small.
The form of a large and small enema:
The head of the cannula above, on which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and it should have a distinction where the bag is tied, as you see.
And its lower extremity, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt (that is, not open) but smooth, tapering to a point; and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the liquid, and a little larger.
And the bag in which the medicines are placed should be made of animal bladder or sheepskin, and its root (or neck) should be one palm (long).
And it should be perforated with many holes as shown; and let the space between the holes be the width of a finger.
And then insert into those holes strong raw gall from about ten gallbladders, or thereabouts; and attach the bag with it; and when the bag is placed in position, let it be tightened at the top of the syringe between two distinctive marks with strong constriction, and then cauterize each hole: But the way to cauterize with it is that you fill the bag with the medicine, which should be warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is not too hot nor too cold.
And then the patient should lie supine on their back, and raise their legs up and place under them a leather or linen sheet; and then anoint the end of the cautery with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or similar; and then insert it into the anus gently, and then the assistant should take the bag and squeeze it strongly with both hands at the same time until everything in the syringe is evacuated into the intestine; and then remove the syringe and the patient should raise their legs against the wall.
And if the medicine forces him to defecate, let him hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps with it for a whole night, it is better for his recovery.
But if you cauterize him for diarrhea and his defecation pains him, then you repeat the cautery until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or harmful abscesses in the anus, then the syringe should be very subtle and smooth, like the syringes with which children are treated.
On the treatment of wounds/sores/plagues. (The word "plagues" here is likely referring to a wider range of skin afflictions than the modern meaning.)
I have already said in the section on the treatment of wounds what was pertinent to the book, and thus I describe the treatment of these with my hand and with medicines according to their complexity/completion/perfection (depending on the exact nuance intended by "conpliment").
Therefore, I say that wounds are categorized according to how the wounds are made and according to the location where the wounds occur.
And the causes by which wounds are often made are like the throwing of a stone, or incision by sword or knife, or striking with a lance, or with wood, or with an arrow, or similar things from many causes.
But the wounds that are in the locations of the body are like a wound which falls upon the head, or the neck, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar ones on the limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some wounds so that you apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the discussion of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from the throwing of a stone or something similar, and it has only broken the skin and it is a large wound, and you fear the development of a hot abscess on that patient, then you should immediately phlebotomize the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and draw blood from it according to the strength of the patient if there is no cause preventing phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has come out of the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded area; and the patient should beware of repletion and wine and coarse foods.
But if some reason prevents bloodletting, then his food should be reduced and he should not go near meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess develops on it, cotton infused in rose oil alone or in wine in which a styptic has been steeped.
But if you are sure of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent, his own blood and, provided the air has not changed it, the powder which I will describe shortly.
And if the air has already changed it (the blood/wound), then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or made by incision with a sword or something similar, and its edges are not joined by stitching, then join them with sutures, as I will explain regarding their suturing.
But if the wound is already exposed to the bone and hangs, and there is little holding it except for a small tendon, then incise it and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh back in place like a chain, and order the patient to avoid foods that are thick: head cheese and soft cheese and things like them, until he is recovered.
And if you find putrefaction in the sinew/tendon and it is not adhering to the bone, then you incise all that is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood might occur, and it is not stopped by medicines, then you examine the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you incise it with a spatula, or tie it off; and if necessity compels you and you cannot do what we have said, then cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is insignificant; so you sprinkle this powder on them, for it strengthens them before the air changes them/infects them.
And the method for the powder is this: take one part incense oil, two parts dragon's blood, three parts unslaked lime; let it all be very finely ground and sifted, and fill the wound with it, and let it be bound with a good bandage until it adheres well to it, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it on top with pillows/cushions/compresses and leave it, and do not untie it while it is like this, that is not abscessed/inflamed, for the medicine must not be removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes use only lime, when incense and dragon's blood are not available to you.
And also perform this same procedure on large wounds when it is appropriate that they be covered and bandaged, and these are fresh wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered/infected.
And if the air has altered/infected them, and especially when it is in the summertime, then the application of this powder is not intended, but then treat them with what we have said, so that you place some digestive ointments on them, or that you put barley flour powder with water and honey on them until they expel pus; and then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, then you treat it with plaster.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of neck wounds/injuries. (Literally: "Of the wounds/plagues of the neck.")
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in medication between it and a simple head wound.
But if the nerve or artery of the neck is incised, then, if it is a nerve, there is no treatment for it except to avoid treating it with something that causes strong constriction, such as cinnabar and vitriol (which is like copper sulfate) and similar things, because they harm the nerves and constrict them. And do not put anything cold on the wound at all, because the substance of the nerves is cold and it is continuous with the brain, which is the highest of all the members/organs.
And if this [the wound] is treated with mild medications, such as washing it with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or plain oil, and red ochre when washed with fresh water, and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or bring the edges of it together, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or you find putrefaction in the lowest part of it, then pierce it in the most depressed place.
But if an artery has been incised in the wound and there is a flow of blood, then separate or dry it, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity compels you to do so.
But if you have incised the vertebrae of the neck, or all of it, and the veins of the neck are saved, then you should join the edges of the skin with a suture over the neck bone and do not touch it; rather, smooth it and return it to its natural shape, and then tighten it with a proper bandage, and leave it for some days; and then treat it with ointments that have styptic and stimulating properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has already caused damage to the bone, then you should clean it, and if there are bone fragments in it, remove all those that you can; and what you are not prepared to remove, leave it until the wound putrefies, and it becomes separated and its discharge is eased.
And if the wound is recent then sprinkle on it the powder which has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with that which will be mentioned later in its own chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then further consider if air comes out of the wound when the patient breathes; then you should know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is fresh with its blood, then in the first hour you apply powder, and do not bind it tightly so that the blood is not retained in its depths and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but apply a drawing ointment, and loosen it twice a day.
And if you do not have the ointment at hand, then place old cotton in the opening of the wound so that it absorbs the fluids that come out; and have the patient sleep on the wound so that what is collected in it will drain.
But if three or more days have already passed since the injury and the patient does not experience spasms, nor heart tremors, nor difficulty breathing, and you see that his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is not life-threatening; and then treat it with baths and other treatments until it is healed.
But if its healing is hindered, and it remains open, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is by incision of sword or knife, and it is simple on the surface of the foot or the back, then treat it with what has been described previously regarding sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has already damaged the bone, and pieces of it have been cut out, then you should enlarge the wound and try to extract those pieces, if they are detached. But if they are not detached, then leave them until the wound becomes putrid, as their extraction will be easier.
And for other accidental wounds in the other limbs, the treatment and cure is the same as what we have said.
Of wounds of the abdomen/belly.
The disorder/illness which occurs in the abdomen is either great, or small, or middling.
And a small rupture is made difficult in another way, and so it is that their reduction is more difficult if you do not take care to insert them into their place immediately, for it opens and swells making their entry difficult.
And therefore the best rupture is the middling one, because the reduction of the intestine is not difficult in that [one], as it is difficult in the two aforementioned types.
And know that suturing of the abdomen is done according to four methods, but two sutures are common, which are suitable for sutures of other wounds of the body.
And two other unique sutures are common to the other wounds, however they are more specific to the suturing of the abdomen.
And I will explain each one to you with exposition and clarification.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has exited through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is due to one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And so, when this is the case, you must warm it by submerging a sponge or wet cloth in plain warm water, or boil it in water with squinanth, cyperus, and spikenard, and foment the intestine with it until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes do this with wine, which has astringency, and is better than plain water in resolving inflammation.
And so, when you see the inflammation is resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallows have been boiled, for by this its entry is eased with little effort.
But if its entry is hindered despite this treatment, then enlarge the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is suitable and there is no incision, and there is no need to resort to drying due to necessity and failure.
Of the instrument, this is its form:
One part of it curved and sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the tip slender, but not with the slenderness of a spatula, rather let it be slightly blunt.
And then when the wound is enlarged and the intestine comes out, then its reduction must be according to its natural form, into its proper place, if it is possible to do so, for it is better.
But when the rupture is large, and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you must make the patient lie on their back, and place their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you place their head and feet higher than the parts below.
And similarly if the rupture is on one of the two sides of the abdomen, then always direct your attention and consideration to this, so that the part where the wound is located is higher than the other.
And thus you must manage this in large wounds and in medium wounds.
And in small wounds, place that which is prepared by you, and then have the assistant, who is positioned between your compassionate hands, hold the entire rupture with his hand and bring the edges together, and then uncover from that area, next to the one who is sewing the suture, any nearby foreign matter.
And this is the common method of suturing: take the needle, or count the needle's length according to the size of the wound; and then leave [a space] from the edge of the rupture the width of a ring finger, and push the needle through, but do not include flesh at the two ends of the stitch, with the two ends of the thread which is below the stitch on the inside parts, until you make it penetrate that part; and you have already joined two ends of the stitch and two ends of the thread, making four strands.
And then tightly grasp [the flesh] with a double thickness around the circumference of the needle, and sometimes on both sides together, and then join the two edges and the wound by appropriate approximation; and then leave the width of a finger and insert another needle there, and then tie it with thread just as you did with the first needle; and do not cease doing this if necessary with the needles until you have completely closed the wound.
And the needles should be medium between thick and thin, for thin needles cut the flesh too easily; and thick ones are difficult to insert into the stitch, and therefore they must be medium in thickness and thinness.
And the needle must not be inserted too close to the two edges of the wound, so that the flesh is not easily cut and the wound reopens before it heals.
And the stitches should not be too long so that they do not hinder the healing of the wound.
And then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient while they sleep; and you will place spread-out cushions all around the suture, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them there until you know that the wound is healed.
And this type of stitching with needles is in every way more suitable for small wounds, because one needle or two, or thereabouts, is sufficient for closing them.
But the second suture is common: and that is that you close with stitches the four edges of the wound and the two edges of the tear, all at once, with a needle on which is wrapped thread of equal thinness and thickness.
And then when you have penetrated these four edges with the needle, bring the needle back out on the same side where you began, so that the drawn thread closes from the most superficial part of the wound downwards, so that the stitching is like the stitching of cloth with which clothes are tightened/sewn.
And leave between each stitch the width of the little finger.
And this stitching men know.
And with such stitching I sewed up the wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was greater than a palm, and about two palms of intestine from the middle part had come out and the rupture was in the middle of the limb; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been out of the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was healed in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I treated him and he is healthy; and after this he lived for many years, and is restored to his normal activities/health.
And the other doctors had judged that he would not be healed; and by a miracle it was, for I did not treat him with ointment, for it was in a place where ointment was not found nor any medicine, but I placed old cotton on the wound twice a day and washed it frequently with honey water until it was healed.
But I will describe two specific kinds of stitching according to Paul(us)'s account/narration.
And you should begin with a chain stitch, and insert the needle from the outside part to the inside part.
And then when the needle penetrates the flesh and into the same laceration lengthwise and along the length of the whole body, leave the end of the thread where you have inserted the needle; and push the needle through the other end from the inside part to the outside part in the other extremity of the wound.
And then when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate again in the same extremity of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other extremity from the inside to the outside.
And make it penetrate with that penetration with which you make it penetrate the thread in the extremity of the wound which is on its side until it penetrates completely.
And then begin on this same side and sew it with the end of the thread that is on the other side, and pull the needle from the flesh which it penetrates, and then put it back into that flesh and sew the end of the thread which is on the other side with this extremity of the wound; and pull it from the flesh which is on its side.
And do this once and again, and do this one time then another time until you sew all that is outside according to this example.
And the summary of this manner of suture is that you sew with a furrier's stitch with which one sews furs, so that you sew the thread once from the side of the extremity of the flesh, and that you leave it the other time until you have completed it.
But the second type of proper suture, which is likewise called "Gauls" - this is from his speech and recounted by him - is that you sew it according to the likeness with which some doctors sew it, so that they join each part to its corresponding part fitting to it by nature; and they apply the extremity of the other part of it and the extremity of the wound to the other extremity of it, and this is done according to what I have told you.
It is necessary that you stick the needle into the edge of the wound nearest to you on the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside part in that place, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside through the two ends of the thread.
And then turn them each, and make each one penetrate from the inside part to the outside part in the two edges of the other wound that are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common simple suture, and it is the suture of which there was previous mention.
This is the speech of Gaul. (Or, this is what Gaul said.)
And moreover some say, suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, that is, you insert a thread into each of them, and begin by inserting the needle on your side, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew hides/leather in the same way.
And know that when a rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than [those of] other places of the belly.
But the treatment of plague is [like/the same as] the treatment of other plagues/infectious diseases.
This is because when you treat the fresh plague/wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the swelling and sew it and dress it properly, then you apply incarnative (flesh-generating) powder over it.
And if the air has already altered the plague/wound, then apply some ointments, which are available to you, until they form a hard scab and the threads fall out, and [the edges] are consolidated/joined together; and then treat it as you would treat other wounds/sores until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines at hand, then apply old cotton over it as soon as it begins to produce pus/discharge, and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you will not need any other medication in many cases when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the plague/infection will spread and harm the principal members/organs, then you should soak wool fleece in oil of moderate quality, or in rose oil, and place it around the areas between the elbows and under the armpits.
And if he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines, for this often happens, then administer an enema with astringent black hellebore wine, especially if the decay has reached the intestine and a passage has formed penetrating into its cavity.
And know that an issue with the large intestine is easier to heal than one in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not fully recover from a wound that occurs in it; and this is because of the large number of veins that are in it and because of the size of the vessels within them, and because of the thinness of its wall, and because of its proximity to the nerves.
But if it is the omentum that protrudes from the wound, and you find it fresh/newly protruded, reduce/replace it according to your method with which you similarly replace the intestines.
But if some time has passed and it has already turned green or black, then you must constrict it with bile on the area that is blackened, so that a flow of blood comes, because there are veins and arteries in the omentum.
And then incise what is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the bile hanging from the part below the wound outside it, so that the pulling of it towards the decay of the omentum and discharge from the opening of the wound will be eased for you.
Remembrance/Reminder of the wounds when they happen in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it be restored in some men, because of this I saw one who had been wounded in his belly with the thrust of a lance and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and had become a fistula, and from it issued excrement and flatulence/gas.
Therefore I continued the treatment of him even though I wasn't confident in his healing, but I persisted diligently in treating it until he was healed and the place was consolidated/closed.
And after I saw the place already healed, I feared that some bad accident might befall the patient in his belly; but no bad accident happened to him for that, and he remained in his best condition eating and drinking, and then he entered the bath and exercised his usual/said routines.
And some experienced [physicians] have said that when a wound happens in the intestine and it is small, then it must be bound in this way: you take ants with large heads; and then bring together the two lips of the wound and place one of these ants, having its mouth open, over the two lips of the wound; then when it bites down on them and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere and will not be dislodged.
And then place another ant near the first, and don't stop doing this with ants one next to the other along the length of the entire wound.
And then return/reduce it and sew the wound; and those heads will remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm will come to the patient.
And it is also possible that the intestine be sewn with fine thread which is made from animal intestine attached to it, after it has been threaded onto a needle; and you take the end of this intestinal thread, and it should be very clean/thinned, and then tie the end of it with thread from it, wrapped around, and then thread this thread onto needles and sew the intestine with it, and replace it in the rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants is only by way of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, for then there is no remedy but alleviation, and it cannot be completely healed.
On the treatment of scrofula and fistula.
Know that every wound and abscess, when it becomes chronic and old, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated and constantly emits pus and is not cut out, then, in whatever limb it may be, is universally called a fistula and we call that scrofula.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, felted lump, which is not painful and which has a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather; and for this reason it is called a feathery ulcer, that is, a quill.
And in some men it is moist, which emits pus; and the moisture is very easily cut away in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and it is scant, and it is coarse, and it is thin.
I have already shown all these causes, and their signs, and their treatment with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that I make you know the treatment of a fistula which is done by means of an operation with the hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all the limbs of the body; for there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the skull, or the intestine, or the bladder, or to any of the ribs, or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints composed by composition such as those of the hand and foot; and there are those that cause damage to the nearby principal limb and similar ones.
And so those of these fistulas that are in this manner are among the illnesses difficult to heal, and do not receive treatment, and occupying oneself with them is labor and ignorance.
And if there are any fistulas whose depth does not reach these places that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its treatment, and you want to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of brass or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, you will explore it with it.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a thin lead probe, because lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily bent and curved along the tortuosity.
And if the fistula has many horrific movements/openings, it is not possible for you to explore it with a probe.
Then inject the opening through its orifices, for the liquid with which you inject it will go towards the other orifices and run out of them.
And then inquire carefully, according to whatever way it is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves there, and if the cavity of the fistula is deep or shallow, or if it is a fistula that has many orifices. And be about all this with the sum of your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the discovery of pain through your compression with your hand on the place, and indications of the symptoms and of the causes incidental to the abscess/fistula.
And when you have considered all these matters with true attention, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and you should consider then if the fistula is clearly superficial or in a safe place, far from a joint, or from a nerve, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from one of the places which I have told you.
Then you dry the fistula according to what was said before in its description, and remove that which is in it, the discharge and corrupted flesh, and that which has grown in the opening of the flesh, or of skin and the like, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of deep profundity, and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it deeply as much as is possible for you, and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh; and then administer bandages soaked in sharp/caustic medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have grasped with an instrument.
And do this a few times until the sharp/caustic medicine corrodes everything remaining in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have described.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you will examine it and dry it as we have recommended, unless you are prevented by some vein or nerve or principal member, as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is any corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that will make it flesh again until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and emits discharge as it did before, then know that you have not reached all of the corrupted part; and then you uncover it again and carefully carry out its scraping and cleaning with your utmost strength, and then restore it.
And then if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then know that the corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which you have not been able to reach, and then you have no choice but to leave it alone.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or you are able to extract it, then extract it with fine forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then carefully extract all of them, and leave nothing behind using all your strength.
But if some sort of humidity obstructs you, and there is no danger or risk of error in cutting them, then cut those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then apply to the wound something that will make the wound rot, and leave it until the flesh and ligaments around those bones have decayed, and make sure the wound does not heal, and keep the incision you made during your operation open.
Meanwhile, if you are worried, place on it cotton soaked in ground soap with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in some of the green ointments, because when those ligaments rot, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction will be easier.
But if it is a large bone such as the bone of the leg or thigh or similar, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it with a rasp only on the surface until the blackness and corruption are removed, and then heal the wound.
But if a large part of it is corrupted, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to cut it open and completely incise it up to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is healed.
And I will tell you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you can use it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, about thirty years old, who experienced pain in his thigh, and from the inner parts [the pain] moved on the matter within the body until the matter reached the thigh, and it was matter of an abscess with a large abscess, and he had no external cause.
And then the time was prolonged with this due to the error of the physicians until the abscess opened, and many substances rushed out of it, and its treatment was then applied until the leg became fistulous, and many orifices were made in it, all of which emitted putrefaction and bodily fluids.
And then a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wise hand among them in the art, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the substances that flowed from those orifices in large quantities; and the man's body was already quite weakened and his color was jaundiced/yellowish.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and the probe reached the bone.
And then I quickly examined all the orifices and found them reaching the bone from all parts of the leg.
And then I took a knife and incised over one of those orifices until I uncovered a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted, and it was already earthy and corrupted and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted so that it had penetrated into the marrow.
And then I scraped what was uncovered and prepared of the exposed bone for me. (Alternatively: And then I scraped the exposed and prepared part of the bone that was uncovered for me.)
And I thought that the corruption, which I excised and scraped, was not in the bone, and I had already eradicated it.
And then I applied a restorative treatment to the wound with consolidating medicine for a long time, and it did not heal/consolidate.
And then I reiterated and uncovered the bone a second time, on top of the first uncovering, and I found continuing corruption in the bone.
And I scraped away what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I endeavoured/tried hard to treat and restore it, but it was not restored/healed.
And then I uncovered it again and I didn't stop incising the bone little by little, piece by piece, and I forced its healing, but it was not healed until I had incised around a palm's width of it, and I extracted that with its marrow, and then I treated that with medicines, and it healed/closed easily and was cured.
And there was no need for repetition in its operation and cutting except for the disposition of its fragility and because of its low tolerance and fear of death, for he suffered at all times from an excess of evacuation and a bad syncope/fainting.
And thus he was healed by a complete healing, and there is no hard flesh in place of bone; and his bodily disposition became good and his strength returned; and he goes about his business and suffers no adverse effects in walking nor harm in any matter.
But if there is a protruding bone in the body already broken/fractured, then you must cut it in this way: take a bandage and tie it tightly at the extremity of that protruding bone, and order someone to pull it upwards; and place a woolen bandage thicker than the first bandage; and then tie it over the flesh that is below the bone, and extend its end so that you draw the flesh to the lower parts, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you want to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or a board suitably under the bone, for when you do this the saw is prevented from cutting the healthy flesh.
And the sawing must be done over the corrupted place little by little, for if there is corruption in the cavity of the bone and it does not appear to the senses, you will be obliged to saw it again.
And if the bone is corrupted and not protruding, rather one part is continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle or in part of it, then you uncover the flesh completely on all sides; and then place wood underneath, and then saw it from the first part where the corruption is located until the sawing is continuous with the other part.
And the sawing should be done a little at a time, according to the location of the corruption, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is connected to the other part.
And if the corruption lies in the area between two joints, then there is no set rule, but rather ingenuity is required. (Implies the surgeon must use their judgement/skill).
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, it is necessary that you investigate how the corruption appears to you, and that you open it, and clean it according to every means possible to you, and with every bit of ingenuity you can muster, so long as you do not encounter a vein or nerve.
And know that the incisions and the saws for incising these bones are numerous according to the location of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their thinness and their size, both large and small, and their hardness and their porousness; therefore, it is necessary that you prepare for each type of operation the instrument appropriate to that operation.
And know that this operation instructs you about the kind of instrument you should use; when you have great study and long experience and knowledge of the methods of this art, and experience with many kinds of illnesses, for then you will have for yourself that which is fitting, the instruments for every disease.
And I am teaching you, at the end of this chapter, the number of instruments that you will set out simply, with which you will proceed to your goal, which you will test on others. The shape of a saw:
The shape of another saw:
The shape of another large saw:
Shape of a ray (or radius/spoke): Let the head of this ray be in the shape of the head of a star-shaped nail, and its points be in the shape of the points of alstefegi (likely a type of nail or pointed tool).
And it is only necessary that with this the heads of the joints be rubbed when they are corrupted, or the mouth (opening/wound) is large and wide.
Shaped like a razor, smaller:
Shaped like a broad razor:  (or "wide razor")
Shape of another saw properly made:  it should be made arched from above and its sharpness of iron, and its handle of boxwood, suitably crafted. Its shape: (or "The shape of it:")
Shape of a razor in which there is a concavity: (or "...which has a hollow")
Shape of another subtle razor: (or "...fine razor", or "...thin razor")
Shape of another razor with a curved extremity/tip: (or "...with a curved end")
Shape of a small razor resembling a tentacle/probe: (or  "...looking like a tentacle/probe")
Shape of another, smaller incisor/knife:
Shape of another incisor; this one resembling a ray (fish), and its extremity/tip is like a saw, and is shown in many places in the discussion/chapter of the bones:
Shape of a ray (fish) which is suitable for the discussion/chapter of that which is perforated/pierced in the bones:
And its extremity/end is triangular and with a sharp point/tip.
And it is made of Indian steel (iron), and similarly it is necessary that all the things that we have said about razors and incisors and saws (apply to this).
On the incision/cutting of extremities and the sawing of the bones.
The extremities may rot either due to an internal cause or an external cause, or when you have treated that corruption/infection by applying those medicines and the treatment is not effective, or you see the corruption spreading through the limb without any apparent cause, then it is necessary that you incise/cut that limb up to the point where the corruption reaches, so that the patient may escape death or a worse affliction/damage of the limb through this.
And the sign of the one to whom this happens is that the limb becomes black as if burned by fire, or if near the blackness the rot spreads within the limb, consuming it and spreading throughout the body; and then attend to it with an incision/cut.
And similarly, if the cause of the corruption/infection is a bite or sting from some venomous creatures such as a sea scorpion, viper, or a spider (rutela - likely a type of venomous spider) and similar creatures.
And if the corruption/infection or bite is at the tip of the finger, then you should incise/cut the finger and not give space for the corruption to spread into the hand.
And similarly if it happens to the hand, then you should incise/cut it at the wrist joint, and not give space for the corruption/infection to spread into the forearm.
And if it affects that (the forearm), then you should incise/cut the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption spreads further and you see it around the elbow, then in that case the patient's death is likely; and to administer other treatment beyond this point is a waste of effort/resources (literally: quantity of virtue/power).
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption affects a toe, then you should incise/cut it back to one of the ankle bones/joints.
And if it takes hold in the arch of the foot, then you should incise/cut the whole foot. But if it progresses into the knee, then you incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy but resignation, and leaving the patient to death.
And the manner of incising the limb or stitching it is that you tighten a ligature on the part below which you want to cut, and tighten another ligature above the location; and have an assistant stretch a ligature on the lower part, and have the assistant stretch another ligature above; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures with a flat spatula until all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be incised or stitched.
And it is necessary that linen cloth be placed around it on all sides so that it doesn't touch the area itself, and so that further injury and a hot abscess don't afflict the patient.
But if there is a flow of blood when you operate, then you cauterize the affected area carefully, or place on it some powders that restrict the blood; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the wounded limb with a bandage in a suitable place, and care for it until it is healed.
And I will recount to you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have recounted to you, which is that blackness occurred in his foot with a burn that resembled a fire burn.
And that corruption occurred first in his toe until it spread to the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself, after seeing the treatment go to the limb with such vehemence that he was overcome with pain and burning, and he himself cut off that foot at the joint, and was healed.
For a long time he had the same corruption in the index finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I endeavoured to drive back that excess with what I applied on his hand, of the medicines, after cleansing his body; and the excess was not driven back and began to spread to the other finger until it began in the hand.
And he asked me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to do this, hoping for the reduction of that excess, and more because I feared his death following the cutting off of his hand, for the patient's constitution was declining.
And after he despaired of me, he returned to his land and it reached me that that man prepared himself and cut off his entire hand, and was healed.
And I have not added this account except so that it may be helpful concerning what befalls this illness, and that it may be a sign by which it is signified and according to which one should act.
On the treatment of sinuses and the method of administering enemas with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy member and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus, and then it ruptures and is perforated, and the pus comes out of it, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is above it is like thinned cloth, and it has not reached a further state of decay, and it does not affect the bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and is not called a fistula.
But however, if the space is prolonged until the decay presses upon some member, then it is called a fistula and not zukem (possibly an ulcer or similar affliction).
And the treatment for it is that you incise that skin entirely as it is rolled up, especially when it is thinned and has become like cloth, and take care that it doesn't adhere to the site due to its decay/infection.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere and that that decay/infection will not have spread further, and on the surface the skin looks healthy, then you treat that with an enema/clyster.
And consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the discharge that comes from it has a foul odor, then administer an enema with an Egyptian medicine which is made of oil, sour wine, and ginger in equal parts, and they are put together in a vessel, and cooked over fire until the medicine becomes red and reaches the thickness of honey.
And then take of it what is necessary and dissolve it with water and honey; and administer an enema with that into the sinus, and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the duration of two hours.
And then extract it by pressing/squeezing; and do this for as many days as necessary until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is treated with an enema of ash water, when this medicine is not available to you; and you should take the ash of vines, and pour water over it; and then strain it and administer it as an enema until you are confident that the sinus has then been cleaned.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then administer an enema with water and honey and ground ginger mixed in, or administer an enema with wine and honey mixed, because it is a property of honey to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes the sinus contract, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this a few times and you are sure that the sinus has been removed, then administer an enema with that which makes flesh grow in it.
And you should take diachylon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or you can administer an enema with other medicines and ointments that have the properties that I have already described in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow so that the enema cannula cannot be inserted, then you should gradually widen it with a small iron tool, and place lint wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment in it until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is too wide, then you should bring the edges of it together with sutures and leave an opening just large enough for the enema to enter without difficulty.
And if the opening from which the discharge flows is elevated in its upper parts, then dry it in the lowest place that is there so that the discharge flows downwards, because when the discharge is held back in the depth of the sinus, flesh will be generated in it.
And if you cannot dry the sinus around the lowest bone as you wish, then you must prepare the limb with a preparation so that the discharge will flow easily, as is suitable for you, and that no part of the discharge be retained in it.
But [change] the one that is over the opening of the sinus constantly so that what accumulates there from the discharge comes out. And so that you know whether that which flows from it, of the discharge, is much or little, or is healthy [digested], or unhealthy [undigested].
And in this way you examine the area of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And when your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter that is released upon the opening of the sinus is sticking, or is close to sticking, then you may loosen it on the second or third day, and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if a subtle/thin virus comes out of the sinus near the area, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is near, because there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and there are those in whom the opposite is true.
And if for many days undigested discharge has come out of the sinus, then know that the sinus is not closing/healing; and if the closure of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you adjust by drying the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are dried thus as diachylon ointment, when a surplus of the addition of wax is included in it.
And the last thing with which it is treated is that you take diachylon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and old wine equal in quantity to it is poured over it, and then you mix that with it, and use that.
And it acts similarly, when there is no discharge, diachylon ointment, honey that is cooked until it is thickened, and use that; or that you take myrrh and aloe and incense, and grind everything and sprinkle it on the honey when it is on the fire, and then spread this on cloth and tighten it over the sinus; or spread it with the honey which you have cooked until it is thickened, and sprinkle it on cloth and tighten it.
And sometimes long birthwort and roots of lily of the valley are administered with it (and it is lily of the valley) and orris-root powder and centaury, and use these simples either by themselves or mixed, grind these and sieve and sprinkle on the honey which I have mentioned; and use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep within it, and already makes an inquest into the bones or into the other hard members or to the ligaments; then you treat it with fistula treatment, as is said above.
On the treatment of panaritium (whitlow) and ingrown nail and addition of finger incision and cutting.
A panaritium is an abscess which arises under the nail of the thumb or the big toe, and easily arises on the other fingers or toes, and when it is prolonged and its treatment is neglected, or it festers from a hot abscess, or is corrupted, and it emits discharge until it corrodes the roots of the nail, and easily corrupts it entirely, and easily spreads its corruption to the bone until it has a foul odor, and the extremity of the finger or toe is damaged, and its color becomes dark.
And so when you have that with what we have said in the division and do not complete your treatment, then it is necessary that you incise with iron all the excess that remains of the nail and then cauterize the wound immediately, because a hot cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is healthy, and the additions (edges) of the nail now compress the flesh on the inner parts, and begin to prick and injure it, then it is necessary that you place a thin sliver under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it up and incise that flesh with ease, and place upon what remains of the flesh corrosive burning medications until it is all removed; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone and extract it, for it will never be healed while the corrupted bone remains there.
And if you see the corrosion and the corruption spreading into the finger, then you should incise it at one of the joints according to the aforesaid procedure, and immediately treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail suffers a blow or abrasion, and severe pain arises in it, then you must first phlebotomize the patient, and then immediately lance the nail with a sharp knife with a transverse cut from top to bottom, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause the patient severe pain, and it will also lead to the growth of excess proud flesh in the area; and then treat the place with something that reduces pain.
But an extra finger, which is born on the hands of some men, very easily becomes fleshy, and very easily bones grow in it, or very easily a nail grows in it.
And some of them are born at the root of the joint, or they originate at some of the joints of the fingers. But the one that is born at some joint of the finger is not bad, and the one that is born at the roots of the joints is very easily made bad/infected.  (Or perhaps, "easily becomes worse.")
And of those that are born fleshy, the removal is easy, and that is that you cut it off at its base with a broad knife.
But of the one that is born at the root of the joint, the treatment is difficult; and so refrain from cutting it off.
But in the one that is born on the finger near the joints, it is necessary that you first cut the flesh around it with a circular incision down to the bone, and then saw it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then treat it until it is healed.
But [regarding] consolidation, which occurs to the fingers amongst themselves many times, either by a birth defect of the man who is born thus, or by consolidation of a wound or by burning with fire, or similar things, then it is necessary that you cut that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in rose oil so that they are not consolidated/joined together easily/prematurely, and separate them, or place between them a thin sheet of lead until it is healed as it should be.
And similarly if consolidation/joining occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you cut that consolidation/joining as is prepared and appropriate to the shape of the limb.
Regarding the incision of varicose veins, these are varices (varicose veins).
Varices are varicose veins, and they are convoluted, thick veins full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many parts of the body, and their most frequent occurrence is in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and porters.
Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile sometimes with strong expulsive medicine, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
But their treatment with iron (surgical instruments) is according to two methods: one is that they be incised and that black blood be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be lifted and extracted completely.
The incision of it (the varicose vein) is according to this method: first foment the leg with hot water until the thick blood, which is foul, is dissolved from the leg, and then constrict the patient's leg from the highest part of the thigh down to the part below the knee with a bandage, and then cut the vein in one place, or in two, or in three with a wide incision, and then elevate the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from above downwards, until the quantity of blood you want and see fit has come out, and which the patient's strength will tolerate.
And then bandage it (the leg), and order him (the patient) to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy (blood-letting) when the veins are full and the patient notices it.
But their elevation (vein removal) is according to this method: you who shave the patient's leg if there is a lot of hair on it, and then put him in a bath and foment his leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins are swollen; or let him be exerted by strong exercise, if a bath is not available to you, until the limb is heated.
And then cut the skin on the right of the vein by an incision lengthwise or behind it below the knee, or at the lowest part of it, below the heel.
And then open the skin with hooks and scrape the vein all around until it appears to the touch, and it is from its appearance that you see it red declining to black.
And then when you pull back and away from the skin you see it white, like a cord.
And then you put the thread underneath it until it is lifted and pulled away from the skin, and suspend it with a hook or thread.
And then make another cut near that cut the space of three fingers, and then scrape the skin of the part above the vein until it appears.
And then lift it and cut it in the second cut along the length of the cut, then pull it out and lift it until it comes out through the second cut, and then pull it out of the cut that is above it.
And do this until you pull it out of the cut that is highest or most above all the cuts, until it is all out; and then cut it.
And if it doesn't obey you in pulling and lifting, then insert a needle with strong, doubled thread and tie it and pull it out, or insert the thread under it and turn your hand in every direction until it is pulled out. And be careful that it is not cut; because if it is broken, it is very difficult for you to lift it and harm will have come to the patient because of it.
And when you have completely removed it, then place wool soaked in wine and rose oil and regular oil on the area of the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is contracted, having tortuosity, to which there is wrapping around the parts, and it is not according to straightness as we have said, then it is necessary that you cut above it at every point of tortuosity and at the places of wrapping, and then suspend it with hooks until you lift the whole thing.
And beware in your cutting that you do not incise the vein and that you do not wound it, because it will be difficult for you to lift it; and use your prudence in this.
The form of the incision with which the vein is cut:
It is not sharp like the hooks nor is it of pointed extremity so that it does not wound the vein; and it has the substantial flexibility of a lion, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein by its thinness; having superfluous thickness as we have said.
On the extraction of a leg vein. (Or: Concerning the removal of a vein from the leg.)
This vein is generated in the legs in hot countries such as in al-Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the hot and arid lands of India with little moisture and in which neither grass nor tree grows.
And it is very easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its formation is from putrefaction that comes under the skin, like how serpents and worms and parasites and maggots arise within the body, generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the approaching arrival/development of this vein is that vehement inflammation occurs in the leg; and then the area blisters; and then the vein begins to emerge from the location of that blister, which looks like a plant root.
And then when the end of it appears, then you must wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one drachma to two drachmas, and tie it and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
And as many times as something comes out of it to the outside parts, wrap it in lead and tie it. And if it is very long/extended, then you incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise its root until it has come out, because if you incise it, it retracts and goes into the flesh and causes an abscess and rotting in the place and a bad ulceration.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is thrown out from the behind/base of it and no part of it remains in the body.
And of this vein, there has come out in some men what is in its length five palms and fingers, and it has even happened to me that one came out of twenty palms.
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, then insert the root into its hole and perforate it with a long hole through the body, until everything that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer putrefaction of the place for some days with medicines; and then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many orifices occur in it, and a branch comes out of each orifice.
And so treat it as we have said in the division and with what is said above.
On the incision over worms generated under the skin, and the illness is called bovine (or "of cattle").
This disease is called in some lands among us "bovine disease," because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and it goes throughout the whole body up and down, and it is revealed to the senses by its movement from limb to limb until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is by putrefaction of certain humors just as worms and snakes and earthworms and intestinal worms occur in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, because when it travels in the body and rises to the head, and reaches the eye, then very quickly it opens into it and enters and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
And so when you want to cure this and extract it, then it cannot be done except by following its movement and the appearance of it to the senses, and then it is necessary that you squeeze what is above it and what is below it with a strong tying and constriction, and then cut over it and extract it.
And if it is deep in the flesh and you do not find it, then you apply a cautery with fire over the place until it dies, and the greatest danger that is feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the place just as we have said.
But if you see it having reached the head near the eye, then squeeze above the eyebrow with strong pressure, and then cut over it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient uses purification of their body with medicines evacuating bad putrid humors, and refrains from foods generating putrefaction.
On cutting/incision for the sickness/disease of nafir.  (Nafir is likely a specific disease or condition.  It's unknown to me, and requires further research to identify).
This disease is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain which comes in some limbs, and then is moved from limb to limb.
And I have already seen it according to what I will recount to you. I was called to a sick woman in a town, and uncovered her arm and saw a small swelling in the cephalic vein of the arm, and after about an hour, I saw that swelling move as a worm climbs upward, but more lightly than could be, as if it were quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and settled in the muscle, and remained there for about an hour.
And then it ran through the other side of the body until it arrived at the other arm.
And then she recounted to me that it revolved through her entire body, as I saw; and I was very astonished by the moving of it and the speed from limb to limb. And I had already seen this before with my own eyes in this manner, but I have seen many who find that pain is transferred from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my eyes like in the woman. / But I did not see it so clearly as in the woman.
And I did not think it to be anything but this, because the woman was old, with a thin body and prominent veins, and in this way the moving wind appeared to the senses.  / ... and thus the movement of this flatulence became apparent.
And it cannot appear according to this returning treatment in those who are overweight and have moist bodies with hidden veins. / ...in those who are of delicate constitution and have a moist body with concealed veins.
And when you want to treat him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press on it and then release the pressure gently and dry over it until that compressed wind has escaped, and cauterize the area.
But if you don't see it with your eyes, then you treat him with shaking of the body and with that which expels winds, and purge these with fetid pills and with pills of aloe and similar things.
On the extraction of arrows. /  Concerning the removal of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the locations of the bodies into which they fall, for their diversity is that of those that have large points, and small, and concave, and blunt, that is, solid; and of those that have three angles, and of those that have barbs; and of those that have shafts/fletchings.
And of the signs of the brain, it is when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and has exited from the skull which is above the brain, for there occurs through it sudden vehemence, and blindness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of understanding and vomiting of bile, and speech is very quickly cut off and the voice is destroyed, and a white humidity resembling dust comes out of the place of the wound, and it appears similar to the serosity of flesh.
And so if these signs appear to you, then you abstain from the treatment and from the extraction of the arrow, unless it is superficial/external.
But the signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart, are that it is near the left nipple, and it feels with it as if it were stuck in a hard object, and not a hollow object; and very quickly the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood runs from the wound, and coldness of the extremities follows, and a cold sweat, and syncope/fainting; and then know that death descends without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are a frothy/spumous emission/coughing of blood from the wound, and the vessels that are near the neck are inflamed/suppurating, and the color of the patient is changed, and he exhales a great high breath, and seeks the drawing in of cold air.
And if the arrow falls into the diaphragm, which is in the chest, and the pain then is near the small ribs, and the breath is made large with intense pain and with sighing, and not all the muscles of the limbs can be moved/are usable/function.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then very quickly some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the belly/abdomen, and is stuck in it, some tissue comes out of the wound, or the omentum, or intestine which is ruptured, and there is no hope in the healing of him by extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out, and some matter proceeds from him to the outer parts, and very quickly there is pain upon the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other limbs such as the face, the neck, and the throat/gullet, and the shoulders and the armpit, and the vertebrae of the back, and the collarbone, and the thigh, and the leg, and their similar limbs, are saved according to their general disposition when the arrow does not find a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I recount this to you that I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may learn from this about your treatment/practice.
Which case is this:  for in a man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye at the root of his nose, and I extracted it for him from the other side, below the crease of his ear, and he is healed, and no damage happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which fell into the corner of his eye, below the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden and I could only grasp a small tip with which it was attached to its shaft, and it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a broad iron head which did not have barbs.
And the Jew was healed, and no ill effect happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had fallen into his throat, and it was an Arab arrow, and it was one which had barbs; and then I made an incision over it between two tendons, and it was already submerged in his throat; and so I worked delicately with it, and then extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and so, after thirty days had passed and no change occurred in his condition, I made an incision over the arrow and grasped it, and he was healed, and no ill effect occurred to him.
And I saw yet another man in whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound closed over it, and after about seven years, the arrow emerged at the base of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound closed within her, and there was no change in her condition at all, and the woman experienced no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had fallen into his face and the wound closed and the arrow remained, finding no great pain there, and many similar to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the man, one of the king's chiefs, which had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already deviated a little to the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him about three days after the arrow struck.
And then I found the arrow's wound very narrow; and then I probed it with a thin probe, and I didn't feel it (the arrow); but he felt a pricking sensation below the right ear, and then I realized that that pricking was due to the tip of the arrow.
And I plastered the area with a plaster that has attractive and digestive properties, trusting that the area would form an abscess so that the location of the arrow would become apparent to me, because I dried it (the wound) with that.
And no significant accident occurred in the area that the arrow had reached; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no accident occurred; and the wound healed in the meantime, and the patient remained without its (the arrow's) extraction for the space of many days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp corrosive medicine on the wound for many days until it opened, and with the probe I examined it, and found the thin tip of the arrow, which was still attached to the shaft.
And then I continued with the opening of the wound using that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly to me, and I spent my time with this for a period of about four months.
And then, after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and remove it (the arrow), and it did not yield to extraction, then I did not cease to refine and devise upon it with ingenious methods, until one day I succeeded with ingenious methods of grasping it with specially made forceps, the form of which will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I healed that wound.
And some doctors believed that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored, but I restored it and the wound is healed, and the patient is cured with complete health, and no harm came to him in any way.
And I recounted to you the nature of extracting certain arrows so that you may establish this as a rule and guideline regarding what I have not said, because the details of this art and its definitions are not grasped by narration, nor does the book contain them.
And the wise artisan understands much from little; and from what is present, what is absent; and finds new operations and new instruments, according to the nature of the unusual cases of the art when they occur.
And so I say that arrows are not removed from the limbs in which they are embedded except in two ways: either by pulling from the place at which it entered; or by the opposite from the other side (where the arrow point emerged).
And that which is removed through the place where it entered, is an arrow lodged in a fleshy place, and it is pulled and removed.
And if it does not yield in this way from the moment you grasp it, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it putrefies, and its extraction and removal is made easier.
And similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not yield to you thus, then leave it for some days and attempt to remove it with pulling and movement each day, and it will be removed.
And if it does not yield to you thus after some days, then you must drill around the arrow in that bone on all sides with a fine drill until the space around the arrow is widened, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body, and concealed from feeling, then you should probe for it with a probe, and if you feel it, then draw it out with some instruments which are suitable for its extraction.
And if you cannot reach it due to the narrowness of the wound and the length of the probe, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then you should make an incision over the wound until it is enlarged and it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if it has barbs with which it is held, then you should free the flesh in which it is lodged on all sides with all the skill that you can; and if you cannot avoid tearing the flesh when breaking or twisting the barbs until it gives way, work on that [freeing the flesh].
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then you should use twisting motions of your hand with forceps on all sides until you make it yield; and use the utmost care so that the arrow is not broken and that the extraction is not made difficult for you.
And if you cannot manage it immediately, then you should leave it for a few days until the parts around it decay, and then try again for at that time it will be easier. But if you encounter troublesome bleeding, then you should administer what we have said about its treatment in its own chapter.
And be careful of cutting a vein or nerve, or tendon, and strive with all possible skill to avoid this when removing the arrow; and do this with ease and calmness and slowness and firmness as I have explained to you.
And then have the patient position themselves to match the posture they were in when the arrow struck them, for this is more helpful. But if this isn't possible for you, then you should do what you can using the illustrations.
But for arrows that are shot through the opposite side, or where some part of it already protrudes, or where the tip of the arrow makes a bulge because it has hit the part just under the skin close by and you see this bulge; then you should cut down upon it; and the cut should be of a size to fit the forceps; and then pull it out, for in this way it is made easier to remove.
But if it is stuck in the bone, then you should turn the blade against it until the arrow presses into the bone, and widens the space for itself, and then you can pull it out.
And if not, leave it for some days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is still in it, then you push it through.
But if the shaft has fallen out and you want to push it through, then insert, if it is blunt, a hollow instrument so that it goes between the hollow of the instrument and the tail of the arrow and then push it through.
But if the arrow is hollow, then you push it through with a strong instrument inserted into it, because the arrow is made lighter by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must remove all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow lands in the feet, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is close enough that you can touch it with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut down on it, then cut down on it and be careful of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then sew the wound if you need to, and treat it until it is healed.
The way forceps are made with which arrows are pulled:
Let their ends be like a bird's beak that are made like a saw when they grip onto the arrow so that they don't let it go.
And of these, many kinds are made, large, small, and medium, according to the size, smallness of the arrow, and the width of the wound, and the narrowness of the place.
like a ray, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased, and it is pushed with that.
On phlebotomy of the veins. (or  Bloodletting of the veins.)
The veins from which phlebotomy is customarily performed are thirty, of which sixteen are in the head: two pulsatile veins near the ears, called alhasisain; two veins in the two apparent temples; and two veins in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called aspicientz; and the vein located in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the tip of the nose; and two guidegi that are in the neck; and two veins that are in the upper lip; and two veins that are in the lower lip (these are the veins that are called algelic); and two veins that are under the tongue. But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five: for of these there is the cephalic, and it is on the outer side; and the common people call it "the vein of the head", and the median cubital vein, which is composed of a branch of the basilic and another branch of the cephalic; and the common people call this one "the vein of the whole body"; and the basilic vein, which is located on the inner side, and is called "axillary", and the common people call it "the vein of the abdomen"; and the brachial vein, which is located above the elbow, and is the one in which phlebotomy is performed, and is the one that appears prominently above the pulse; and the salvatella, which is the vein between the ring finger and the little finger, and it has two branches.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins: one of them is below the bend of the knee on the outer side; and the second is the saphenous, and its location is below the leg on the inner side; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the outer side; and in the leg there are other veins similar to these.
The benefit of [phlebotomy of] the veins near the ears is for chronic catarrh, migraine, dizziness/vertigo (sahafati), and chronic malignant ulcers of the head.
And the way to bleed these [veins], as I have explained to you, is as follows: the patient's head should be shaved, and the patient's head should be rubbed on the occiput at the location of both veins with a large cloth with good friction; then the patient should tighten their neck with a bandage until the two [veins] and their locations appear near the ears in two depressed places on the head; and you should search for them with your finger, and if you feel their pulse with your finger, bleed there with a lancet.
Then you take the cutting lancet, which is the sharp one, and insert it under the vein into the skin until the phlebotomy reaches the bone. And then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards and incise the vein with a sharp incision. And the length of the incision should be the width of two fingers joined together, or thereabouts; and let out as much blood as you wish.
And then bandage it with compresses and leave it until it is healed.
And the incision of these [veins] and their cauterization has already been discussed at the beginning of the book.
But for the two arterial veins that are at the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy (blood-letting) is for chronic and severe migraine, persistent eye inflammation (ophthalmia), and [cases] of sharp excess fluids effused to the eyes.
And the way to phlebotomize these is as I recounted to you: have the patient strongly bend their neck until the two veins appear visibly to the touch and their pulse can be felt beneath your finger; and then you mark them with ink.
And then you lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and raise the vein up; and incise it as you have done with the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to the amount needed.
And then loosen the binding on the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then place cotton and powder on it and tighten it firmly with a bandage, and leave it until it is healed.
And the description of them, and their incision, and the drawing [of blood] has already been given at the beginning of the book.
And so the benefit of phlebotomy of the forehead vein is similar to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for long-standing illnesses of the face and for migraines, redness, and foul-smelling ulcers.
And the method of his phlebotomy is as I related to you; that is, that the patient tightens his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is called a *fossori* of which this is the form:
Place the pointed tip which is at the end of the *fossori* on that vein and strike it with a hammer or other object in the manner described, and let the blood flow according to the desired quantity; then loosen the bandage on the patient and bind the wound until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a broad lancet, but it is not necessary that the lancet have a sharp point like other lancets, but rather a broad tip, and phlebotomize it transversely, because the bone is nearby and a thin lancet would very easily break on it.
But the benefit of the two veins that are at the tear ducts of both eyes is for scabies of the eyes, for redness and mattering in the eyes, and for illnesses of the face.
And the method of phlebotomy is that the patient tightens his neck with a bandage, and then you phlebotomize them, standing above his head.
And let the phlebotomy be done somewhat transversely and lengthwise with a small lancet, because there is no flesh in that area; and if the lancet is thin, its tip will be broken very easily.
And then let the blood flow as much as is necessary for you, and place cotton over them, and bind them for one night, and then loosen them.
But phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and severe heartburn, and for diseases of the face and migraine and redness that occurs in the face, and especially when it is chronic.
And the method of its phlebotomy is that the patient tightens his neck and then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long thin lancet and insert it in the middle of the tip of the nose vertically, because the vein cannot be felt there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Be sure to remove your hand with the lancet little by little and let the blood flow according to your need; and then bandage it for one night, because it heals quickly/easily.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the two jugular veins helps with constriction of the breath/shortness of breath and the beginning of leprosy and many diseases and impetigo and bad corrosive ulcers as well as herpes.
And the way to perform phlebotomy on them is that the patient should compress each one at the neck with a bandage/tourniquet; and the practitioner stands above the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a chair/stool.
And then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide lancet little by little; and then draw blood in a moderate amount or according to what you see is needed for it; and then do the same to the other vein.
And then untie the bandage/tourniquet and compress the two veins with a moderate bandage/dressing so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning, because the wound will be healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the Algerian veins [likely a specific vein, perhaps in the arm],  is helpful for small abscesses and pustules of the mouth and corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and for bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the way to perform phlebotomy on these is that you make the patient sit before you, and tighten his neck with a bandage/tourniquet, and then you turn back his lips and look at two veins of which one is on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the identification of each is by the blackness of each of them, and this is more so because around them are small black veins; and then you incise each one with a lancet.
But if you are in doubt, and you do not know which one it is, then you should make an incision in the larger of them, and the more visible of them.
And do the same for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of the two veins that are below the tongue, the benefit is closer to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for choking/suffocation that are in the throat, for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the way to phlebotomize them is as follows:  place the patient between your hands facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look beneath the tongue; on one side of it [the underside of the tongue] a vein, and on the other side a vein, and the color of each is tending toward black.
And then phlebotomize each one; and be careful not to move your hand deeper when phlebotomizing them, because arteries are located beneath them.
And your veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those in which it is customary to perform phlebotomy on all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways, either pricking them with a myrtle-leaf-shaped or olive-leaf-shaped lancet with a subtly sloping point; or cutting with a knife-like lancet, which is called alnessil, and this is its form:
Let its width be as you see, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, protruding, apparent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this lancet is of lesser width and with a more subtle point, and it is suitable for phlebotomy of thin veins that contain thin, clear blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: for it draws out blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and from that which follows [affects?] the feet and belly.
And it is appropriate for the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy on this vein, that they take great care and be extra cautious with it, for there is an artery beneath it, and if they err and are imprecise in the puncture of the phlebotomy, they will incise that artery and cause a flow of blood, therefore it is necessary that they not phlebotomize this [vein] with a pointed lancet, but rather with a cutting one like a small knife/lancet.
And if the basilic vein does not appear manifestly, then you must leave it and move to another, or look for one of its branches; or phlebotomize instead at the end of the arm, for there it is manifest; and lance it with a knife-like lancet as we have said.
But if you wish to perform phlebotomy in the same place [presumably, the basilic vein area], then before tying the arm you should touch the area until you find the location of the pulse, and then mark it with ink; and then tie the arm and lance the vein with a concave cut using a knife-like lancet as we have said; and be careful that the incision does not fall within any space near the artery.
And when you see, as you tighten the bandage, swelling in the place you have marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid it.
And if you see the blood flow in the phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is a thin red, then know that it is blood from the artery; and then cover and place your finger over it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood has stopped, for many times it stops, then you bind the arm and leave it.
And protect the patient from moving [the affected limb], and let him be cautious and not eat too much for some days until he is healed.
But if the blood has not stopped, and you see that you have no medicine at hand for this, then you should incise the artery, if it seems appropriate to you; because its end is constricted, and the blood flow is stopped; or you can take bark of pistachio, and grind it, and take half of it and press it on the area of the vein with tight bandaging and with powders until the next day.
And then if the blood flow has stopped, it is good; and if not, then treat it with that which was mentioned before in the section on powders that stop the flow of blood.
And stopping the bleeding is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.
But from the dark vein, phlebotomy (blood-letting) is beneficial, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is made up of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And the bloodletter should be very careful during phlebotomy of this vein, because beneath it there is a nerve; and therefore if he errs in the puncture of the phlebotomy and hits the nerve, numbness will occur, and its healing will be difficult, and very easily it will not be completely healed. And this nerve is often apparent to the touch; and if it is hidden to some men and is subtle and is not visible, then you should perform the phlebotomy with which you let blood by the method of lancing, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and provides relief for diseases of the eyes.
And it is fitting in this particular case, if you wish to phlebotomize, to puncture with an olive-shaped lancet or a myrtle-shaped lancet; for it is the safest of all the veins, because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
But it very easily swells up in some men, when it is not phlebotomized on the first incision, but this swelling does no harm.
The first of these is that you must know that phlebotomy is not administered except for the preservation of health and for the hope and precaution of the occurrence of diseases, and that phlebotomy should be done in one of the veins that are in the elbow, that is: cephalic, median cubital and basilic; and that phlebotomy be performed at the beginning of spring, before breakfast in spring and autumn, and in winter close to mealtime, when signs of repletion appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the third day or the first after three hours of the day have passed.
But phlebotomy can be administered, when necessity and appropriateness call for it, either by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.
And a child should not be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be phlebotomized except from the fourth month until the seventh, and the elderly who have already passed sixty years should not be phlebotomized.
And when anyone wants to be phlebotomized in any way, it is necessary to cleanse their bowels before phlebotomy with a light enema, if they have much retained excrement in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities from the cleansed bowels during phlebotomy, and so that they do not harm the principal members.
And patients with nausea, vomiting, or indigestion should not be phlebotomized, nor those recovering from illness or drunkenness until they have recovered, nor those ill with dropsy; and further, phlebotomy should be avoided near the time of colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual intercourse, work, exercise, fasting, vigils, and any cause that weakens the body, be it physical or mental.
And consider beforehand the thinning of humors, if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if this is possible.
And then enter a bath if nothing prohibits it, or exercise in some way so that the blood is thinned.
And perform his phlebotomy at the end of the day, that is, around the hour of terce (mid-morning, approximately 9 a.m.), as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's foot is protected on that day from all harmful mental events, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and from all physical events, such as excessive work and exertion, and sexual intercourse, and things similar to them.
And in his chamber, ensure the presence of things commonly used by men for aroma and fragrance, with balms and similar things according to the extent of possibility.
And the phlebotomist should sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be bled.
And then he should extend his (the patient's) arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it with his hand two or three times; and then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it twice.
And the tightness should be moderate, because when the tightness is not even, or the tightness is excessive, it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, it likewise prevents the proper flow of blood.
And after the tightening, it is necessary that the one who is to be bled rub his hands together until the veins are swollen, and become apparent to the touch.
And then the phlebotomist should anoint his lancet with a little old oil (specifically); and then place the index finger of his left hand on the vein, below the place where he intends to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein moves a little, and the incision is precise.  For there are veins which you find like a cord fleeing from the lancet, and these are full of air, and when you place the lancet on them, they contract away from the lancet, and the phlebotomist is deceived; and the lancet does not open the vein, and if it does, the opening is narrow.
And therefore, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be steady and attentive to all these things.
And then insert the lancet, and if the vein is opened in one stroke, then it is good; and if not, you repeat this a second time a little below that spot, or above it quickly, if the area is not infected/inflamed. (apostemat could mean either abscessed or just generally inflamed/infected)
And if the area is infected/inflamed, or the patient is afraid, then you leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for it will very easily attract hot infection/inflammation, and do not let him enter a bath.
And then repeat the bloodletting if it is needed/desired. (ama - could mean loves/desires/needs - depending on the exact nuance intended, "if it is necessary" might be better).
And if the opening is small and thin blood flows, and you fear that it will not yield the quantity of blood that you want, then you repeat the phlebotomy in that hole following straightness and adjusting the opening a little, and do this quickly before the area is infected/inflamed, for the area is easily infected/inflamed in many people by a small opening.
But if you see it already infected/inflamed, then do not repeat on it, for it will not help you at all; and place on it some split/cracked olive, for it lightens/relieves the body of blood. (This probably refers to a poultice or some other application of olives). And it is better in this place than [plain] oil and other oils.
And similarly administer cracked/split olive in all phlebotomy with which you bleed veins because of the prohibition of thick blood, and do this [also with] theriac, al-fadoq (possibly a type of plaster/poultice), and sagapenum (a gum resin) when one of these is placed on the area, because the blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
And if in the place of the phlebotomy a large swelling/abscess is engendered, for it happens many times, and especially to the one who has not been bled except that one time, or in the opening of a small vein, then you cover and place on the area a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly warmed, and tighten it for an hour, for it is dissolved/resolved.
And it is necessary to do this near the exit of the blood of that vein with its completion/full draining or of another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the place for some days, do not fear this; and if you wish, place on that some aloe and dissolved myrrh, or some juice of wild mint or calamint or similar.
And many times swellings and protrusions occur because of phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And then place your hand upon it, and if then you find softness beneath your compression upon it, then that swelling is bad and dangerous; and therefore be careful that you place upon it something of what we have said, for blood will flow very easily from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that is styptic, so that the place is hardened, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you draw blood from every man according to the amount of his strength and according to the dominant color over the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it out until it is red; and similarly if you see it thick, then you let it out until it is thinned; and similarly if it is sharp (thin/acrid), until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong and needs bloodletting at once, that the phlebotomy of the vein be amplified and the lancet be wide.
And in one who is frail, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to extract it in several instances, and that the opening be narrow/small.
And the best that is administered in phlebotomy of a vein is that the incision be transverse, not a puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safe from blood flow and nerve incision/damage, and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy along the width and length (of the vein).
And for him who is accustomed to faint during phlebotomy, and you must treat this person before the phlebotomy with a little bread infused in pomegranate wine or warm simple oxymel (vinegar and honey); and extract his blood in three or four instances/stages.
And if it is coldness of complexion/constitution, then before the phlebotomy take bread infused in syrup of myrrh or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and the like, or in aromatized and very fragrant syrup.
And if fainting occurs during the phlebotomy, and the cause is the loss of a lot of blood, then it is necessary that he drink meat broth and very fragrant subtle syrup; and use aromatics with rosewater, and his feet should be bathed with it.
And make use of the other measures that we have mentioned in the section in the chapter on syncope due to evacuation.
And he who wishes to bandage his arm and dissolve/reduce his blood a second time, must, if the phlebotomy is for a large evacuation, and his constitution is cold, evacuate the blood little by little, that is, according to the strength of his constitution, on consecutive days.
But he who wants to bandage his arm, and let his blood [flow] a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do this about seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
But he who wants to draw the blood from his body away from the part to which it flows, must be bandaged on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much heated blood and is acute and causes fever, must have its blood let all at once and a large quantity should be drawn and the opening enlarged until syncope occurs, after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and you should place your hand on his pulse on the side away from the bleeding, so that death does not occur instead of syncope, because this happens many times when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not appropriate when you want to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, since the opening of the vein has already closed and the outflow of blood is difficult, that you press upon it with vehemence and that which is bent is extended forcefully, for this is very bad.
Leave it alone until it is phlebotomized a second time; or remove what is coagulated from the blood at the opening of the vein with the sharpness of the lancet; or place on it some al-faruq theriac, or dragon's blood, and compress it lightly until the blood flows out.
And if the vein is infected/abscessed, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the infection/abscess has subsided.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no other option, then you bleed the patient on that area or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "rope of the arm" is phlebotomized in place of the cephalic or basilic vein, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the way to perform phlebotomy on him is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly.
And then it should be tightened above it with a bandage with moderate pressure; and then phlebotomize according to the small transversal, not latitudinally nor longitudinally.
And let the opening be wide and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize it over the joint of the hand a little.
And if the flow of blood is stopped, then you put the hand back in the warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve the required amount.
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from putting the hand back in the warm water, although it is better to place the blood vessel in warm water in winter time.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is no pulsating vein, nor nerve, underneath it.
And phlebotomy of the cephalic vein of the right hand is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
And the proper way to perform phlebotomy is that you tighten the hand with a bandage or with your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you cut it completely, this will not harm anything.
And be careful not to damage your hand with the phlebotomy, because underneath there are the nerves of the fingers, bare of flesh.
And then return the hand to the warm water and let the blood flow into it, because if you don't return it to the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and its flow will be blocked.
And when the blood has been extracted according to the necessary amount, then you put oil and salt on the vein, so that it is not closed up too quickly; and similarly you must do with any narrow branch (vein).
But the benefit of phlebotomy in the left hand is that it is suitable for diseases of the spleen.
And do likewise in his phlebotomy as you have done in the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein applies to diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the uterus, and retention of menses, and diseases of the kidneys and ulcers of the thighs and old legs, and similar ailments.
And the procedure for his phlebotomy is that the patient puts his foot in hot water and rubs it until the veins appear well; and tie above the ankle with a strap; and the place of the vein to be cut appears above the said thumb, and from it are branched many small veins on the surface of the foot.
And then phlebotomize the largest branch either below the leg above the heel or below its confluence, because it is better and safer.
And if you phlebotomize it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot, and position your lancet with which you phlebotomize across, as if you intended to incise it.
And let the phlebotomy be ample/generous. / And let the bleeding be substantial.
But if the flow of blood is restricted; then you immerse his foot in the hot water again and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated/drained.
And if the phlebotomist errs on the first attempt, then repeat with the lancet a little above, because the location is safe; and do not fear to harm him, but beware of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same with the saphenous vein of the other foot.
And concerning the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is behind the heel below the ankle on the outer side. / And as for the sciatic vein, the place, as we have said, is behind the heel bone beneath the ankle of the left leg.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy (bloodletting from it) is for hip pain when caused by hot blood.  / And the benefit of phlebotomy there is for pain in the hip when it is caused by hot blood.
And the proper way to perform phlebotomy on it is that the patient enter a bath, and quickly and tightly bind his thigh on the side of the hip down to above the heel with a long, thin bandage, for it (the vein) appears only by doing this.
And then when it appears, you then phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you and across (transversely), and that is better; or incise it by making an incision or cut it by sectioning, because the area is safe. / And when it appears, you should then perform phlebotomy on it by any method you can, preferably transversely; or make an incision, or sever it completely, because that location is safe.
And it is very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear clearly to the touch, then phlebotomize a branch of it, which is the one that appears on the top of the foot near the little toe and the ring toe. / And it is very hidden in many people; and if you find it, but it is not readily apparent to the touch, then you should bleed a branch of it, which is the one that appears on the top of the foot towards the little and ring toes.
And beware of the nerves, and let flow the quantity of blood that you desire.
And then loosen the bandage and place cotton over the site of the phlebotomy and compress the area, for it is easily healed.
Concerning cupping/venesection and the properties of their use. /  On cupping therapy and the characteristics of its use. (Ventosacio refers specifically to a cupping procedure, not just general venesection, though bloodletting is often a component).
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or brass, or glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification (dry cupping).
And this cupping that is without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And for cupping that is administered with scarification and blood extraction, there are fourteen locations on the body, one of which where cups are placed is on the inion (back of the head), and it is the rear part of the head; and the middle location of it [the head?] between the two sides of the neck together; and cupping of the chin below the mandible, further below the mouth; and cupping of the two shoulder blades; and cupping on the alohoster, and that is above the end of the tailbone (coccyx); and cupping of the two armpits, which are below the two arms; and cupping of the two ankles; and cupping of the two thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins dispersed in the flesh, and because of this, the strength does not fall through them, as is the case with phlebotomy (venesection); nor should cupping be done, with fire or without fire, in any illness caused by repletion (excess) until the whole body has been evacuated.
But if necessity compels cupping because of illness or for maintenance, we administer it at any time at the beginning of the month and at its end, and in the middle of it and at whatever time it may be.
And so when you see any of these signs, and especially if it is in the third or middle of the month, then we recommend that cupping be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping on the nape of the neck is that it helps with heaviness in the head and that which affects the eyes; but it is necessary that this be near a time of complete evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not permitted for someone of a cold complexion, or someone who has a catarrh, to use it, because it causes them great harm.
And for this reason, old people, and those whose heads suffer from cold ailments, should not use it.
But for those on whom it is continuously used, it causes forgetfulness; and therefore you should instruct the cupper to pause his hand a little with the cup at the lower parts, for fear of causing forgetfulness.
But cupping with alkali is in the place of phlebotomy of the median cubital vein and the basilic vein: and therefore it benefits asthma, constriction of the breath, damage to the respiratory system, coughs, and fullness/plethora.
And the alkali cup should be applied lightly, because if it is placed heavily, it generates weakness in the body and stomach.
And cupping with alhagdahan (possibly a type of cupping material) is beneficial for accidental pains in the head, ophthalmia (eye inflammation), migraine, suffocation, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and it replaces phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And you should instruct the cupper not to press his hand with the scarification tool lest he incise an artery and cause excessive bleeding.
And cupping under the chin benefits canker sores in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar oral diseases; and it replaces phlebotomy of the veins (aliheric) that are in the two lips.
But cupping done over the two shoulder blades is beneficial for headache (caphatan), which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on both sides within the armpits effectively replaces phlebotomy of three veins, namely the basilic, median cubital (fusca), and cephalic veins, because it draws blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh, and those smaller veins from larger ones until the drawing reaches the three main veins.
And instruct the cupper not to go too deep in the scarification, because the area [the armpit] is lacking in flesh, and underneath are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cupping glass which is used on the hips, and it benefits hemorrhoids of the anus and deeper ulcerations.
And you should instruct the cupper to use a large cupping glass, and that it be made of bronze, because the location requires strong suction; and thin cupping glasses break easily and it should be scarified with a scarificator.
But cupping glasses on the legs lessen manifest plethora, because they draw blood from the whole body, and benefit old aches of the kidneys and womb, and of the bladder; and provoke menstruation, and benefit buboes and swollen glands; and they take the place of phlebotomy of two saphenous veins, thus relieving them, and of two ankle veins.
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause fainting in many men.
And the relief from cupping glasses on the groin is similar to the relief from cupping glasses on the two legs.
And the proper way to apply the cupping glasses is to place the cupping glass initially empty and draw with moderate suction, and do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them lightly, and remove them carefully, so that the humors come to the location with a gradual arrival. And do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the place redden and swell and the redness of the blood appears.
And then you scarify and repeat the suction little by little, and then consider the disposition of the bodies.
For a person who is of tender flesh with sparse pores, it is necessary that you scarify him only once and no more, so that the place does not ulcerate.
And order the cupper to widen the scarification and deepen it a little, and moderate the suction gently.
And if there is thickness in the blood, then you must scarify twice, because on the first time the way of thinning is opened to the blood and its wateriness. But on the second, to the careful examination acquired from the extraction of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very polluted, then let scarification be done a third time so that it attains the rest (of the polluted blood).
And lastly, when we want to extract the blood little by little, or a small amount, one scarification is enough for us.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we scarify with many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that we scarify with a deep scarification.
And the limit of scarification is only as deep as the skin.
And if the person whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and their pores are narrow, it is necessary that the locations for the cupping glasses be anointed with softening, opening, and resolving [ointments]; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or hip seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or blood oil, and things similar to these.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balsam mint oil, or aloe oil, or dill oil, and things similar to them.
But if the person to be cupped has wide pores and tender flesh, then it is necessary to avoid oil, and it is necessary for these people that the locations for cupping, close to the time of cupping, be washed with rosewater or with cold nightshade water, or with hip water, or with borage water, and things similar to these.
And for the one whose blood has much humidity, wash their cupping locations with sour wine, or with myrtle and sumac water, and things similar to these.
And for the one whose superfluities are thick, wash their cupping locations with old wine, or with marjoram water (which is called "sansuc"), or with a decoction of dill, or of chamomile, and things similar to them.
And cupping should be avoided before a bath; for those having it, it should be administered about one or two hours after exiting the bath, and they should sleep after the cupping.
What is the necessary regimen for one who is to be cupped or bled before cupping/venesection? (Alternatively: How should one who is to be cupped or bled manage themselves before the procedure?)
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the person to be cupped or bled is choleric and experiences sharp blood and inflammation, then they should take cooling things, such as sour pomegranates, endive with sour wine and lettuces, hemp, julep, and things similar to them.
And include in their meals things like chicken, and the meat of wild birds, and foods seasoned with sour flavors, and similar things.
And for one whose complexion is cold, they should take syrup of marshmallows, or syrup of hemp seeds, and sumac, and a very fragrant medium-dry wine (between old and new); and it is recommended that they partake of little drink and food, and include in their meals chicken, hemp, fish, small birds, and pigeon/dove.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping or bloodletting, the drink be greater than the food (i.e., they drink more than they eat).
And it is necessary to give some men Theriac Al Faruq, or medications of musk, that is nutmeg, or alcelita (a kind of confection) to drink at certain times before cupping or bloodletting or immediately afterwards, so that the principal members are strengthened and the blood is thinned; and they should not take those (medications) warm/heated.
But the cups that are without scarification (dry cupping) are cups that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen and for gout, and on the navel, in the areas of the knees, and the hip socket, for these members do not tolerate scarification on them.
And it is not sought by these (cups without scarification) to draw blood from the limb, as when we place a cup on the breast in the case of nosebleeds; and we use it (cupping) so that cold, ingrained wind/flatulence is dissolved from the limb, as when we place it on the belly and navel; for it rarefies the limb and warms it and reduces the pain because it dissipates flatulence.
And it (cupping) is also placed on the kidneys when blockage or pus occurs in them, for by the power of suction it very easily opens the blockage and eradicates the pus from its location.
And it does similarly when placed on the liver and spleen because of flatulence enclosed in them.
And these cups are administered empty with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire (fire cupping).
And sometimes they are administered filled with warm water in diseases of the spleen.
And this is so that the cup may be filled and be larger, that is, with hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
The way to make a cup administered with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, as we have made it; and the amount of the grip be half a palm; and let it be on its side, in the place that is on the circumference, the middle of it, the hole should be small according to the size that a needle will enter it.
Let it be made of red or yellow brass, with thick, smooth, even and polished edges so that it does not harm the limb where it is placed.
And let there be in the middle of it a transverse rod of brass or iron, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And let this cup be much larger than the one we have described; and somewhat smaller than that according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cups for children and weakened individuals are different than the cups for young people and those with large bodies.
And the way to place this cup with fire on the limb is to suitably extend the wick with a wood fire in front of a small wax candle, and place it on the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cup, so that the fire is lit around the lower part so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be over the hole that we have mentioned, until, when we are holding the cups and do not need to uncover the hole and let the vapor escape through it, then the cup will be immediately released.
And then light the wick according to the usual manner, and repeat it if you need to.
But in a cup that is administered in the disease of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod nor hole, it is only administered when it is filled with water, and it is placed on the limb just so.
And this is its form: And this cup, the larger it is, the better, so that it can receive a large quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered on many limbs but on those where the placement of cups is not possible, due to their small size, such as the wrist and gums and similar areas; or on a limb devoid of flesh, such as the finger and the nose and their like.
And the appropriate way to use them is that if you have found leeches that are in the fresh waters of clean springs...
And then they should be left for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies; and then the body should be evacuated initially by phlebotomy (blood-letting) and with cups; and then the patient's limb should be rubbed until it reddens; and then the leeches should be placed upon it.
And when they are full, they will fall off.
And if suction of the location with a cupping glass is possible, it is more helpful afterwards.
And if not, then wash the area with sour wine and then with hot water; and let it be rubbed and pressed.
And if the flow of blood from the body is prolonged after the application of leeches, and it oozes, then you should soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it over the area until the oozing stops.
And if the bleeding is profuse, then sprinkle over it crushed vitriol, or gallnuts and similar styptic substances, until the blood is staunched; or place the halves of cooked broad beans on the area, and leave them there until the beans adhere to the area, and the blood is staunched.
And it is necessary, if repeated application of leeches is required, to change them when possible.
And if the leeches refuse to attach, then rub the area with fresh blood or prick it with a needle in several places until blood comes out; and then apply them, for when they sense blood they will attach immediately.
And when you want them to detach, sprinkle on them a little crushed aloe, or salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: on restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it concerns the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in the bones.
Oh, son, know that foolish and vulgar physicians, and those who have never consulted the books of the Ancients nor read a letter of them, boast about this chapter.
And for this reason, this method of the learned is hidden in our land; and I have not at any time completely forgotten it; and I have not used what follows, except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and study of their meaning, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
And then I applied myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
And I have described in this chapter everything that my knowledge contains and upon which my experience has passed; after having abbreviated it for you and freed it from the burden of lengthiness; and I have shortened it to be concise; and I have demonstrated it clearly; and I have formed in it many forms of the instruments that are administered in it, as is done by adding clarification, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
Summaries and collections on the nature of bone fractures, of those whose premise is necessary, before we begin the discussion of fractured limbs and the different [treatments] of each one. It is fitting, then, that we state in the prologue of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters to the understanding of which the artisan is forced at the beginning and to dwell on their truth; that is to say, you and those of you who are eager to know or learn this noble art [along with] others.
And so I say that when someone experiences a fracture or dislocation or sprain or fall, then you should attend to at the beginning with phlebotomy (blood-letting) or purging him, or both together, unless some condition prohibits it, such as weakness of strength, or if it happens to a child, or an old man in decrepitude, or it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
And next, let his food consist of cool herbs and the meat of birds and river crabs; and we forbid rich meats and filling himself with foods, and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are safe from hot swelling, and if you do not fear an outpouring of matter into the limb.
And then return the patient to his first regimen, with which he is accustomed.
And so when the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient should be nourished with nutritious foods of much substance, rich and heavy, in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and fat meat and things similar to these, and with this regimen the knitting of the fracture is achieved more easily and better.
And know that broken bones when they are in men who are in their first old age (i.e. beginning to age) and in the decrepit, it is not possible that they be joined and consolidated according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs.
But still, nature adds and applies over the broken bone on all sides a certain glue-like substance, in which there is a thickness that adheres to and binds it together until they are glued and bound together, until they reach their full strength and firmness, as with fire at the beginning, until something prevents it from completing its work.
And for this reason it is necessary that you provide the patient with foods in which there is heaviness, viscosity, and richness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the skull; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly all the other limbs are different from each other.
And I come to a consideration of every kind of fracture, explained in its own chapter, distinct from the others.
Much diversity of fracture in itself. And the types of bone fracture are diversified in themselves; for there are arched fractures other than those that occur in the ankles; and sometimes a fracture is made along the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the sagittal, and splint bones, and additions proceeding and not proceeding, as is done in the quill when it is prepared for writing, and there is fracture with wound and disruption in the head, and there is small fissure fracture.
And to each type there is a proper device or torment in its restoration according to what will be discussed distinctly in its place.
Many signs of bone fracture. And by this a bone fracture is recognized: its crookedness, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and this when you compress it with your hand.
And thus when there is no apparent crookedness in the place nor is it made by your touch when you touch the bone with movement and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture there.
However, it is possible that there may be crookedness or a small fissure, then you should not press it with your hand and with complete compression; rather, place upon it the medicines of which there will be discussion shortly, which are suitable for the place; and then it should be bound with a light bandage.
And know that the place when it is arched and not split in two or otherwise not seriously injured, such as when any part is removed from its counterpart, then you must begin immediately to straighten it, lest a hot abscess occur there.
And if a hot abscess occurs there, then leave it for a few days until the abscess subsides; and then adjust it in whatever gentle and ingenious way you can.
And know that its restoration and healing are easier than for a bone in which a serious injury has occurred.
And then bind it as will be discussed later.
But if the bones are seriously injured, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from two sides, if it is the hand or the foot; either with your hand if the limb is small; or with two ropes or with one rope and your hand.
And position yourself so that you place the limb evenly according to its natural shape, while the parts of the broken limb are being extended, then you must return those additional pieces gently and in whatever way you can to their places.
And take care, according to your strength, that no pain or injury occurs to the patient because of your work; and you must, according to your ability, apply one bone to its companion according to their best forms.
And it is necessary at that time that you skillfully touch it with your hand, and if you see anything amiss, rectify it and adjust it to the best of your ability.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, as many foolish doctors do, who often cause an abscess because of their work, or cause contraction in the limb, as we have seen this happen because of their work many times.
And the manner of binding the injured limb is what I recommend; so that you know that broken limbs are diverse in their smallness and in their greatness and in their shape.
And for those that are small like the arm and the finger and the radius and similar to those, then the wrapping should be of a very fine soft cloth.
But those that are large like the thigh or the leg, it is necessary that the wrapping on them be wide and strong, because the wide bandage joins the large limb and tightens it on all sides with even pressure, so that no blemish occurs on it.
And then begin your reduction, setting, applying a suitable bandage for this, over the place of the fracture with three or four wrappings according to what the limb requires; and tighten your hand a little with the bandaging.
And then go with it to the part most above the location of the fracture, and tighten less than you did the bandaging with which you tightened the place of the fracture itself. And then move away with the bandaging from the site of the fracture a little, and loosen the tightness little by little, until you take in a large area around the site.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with bandaging, and then go with the wrappings to the part below the fracture; and your work in the tightening of the bandaging and in the loosening of it should be according to what we have said about the first bandaging above.
And then place between the turns of tow flax or cloth with which the crookedness of the fracture is padded, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, don't place anything there.
And then place another bandage on it, and then neatly place freshly made splints on top of these bandages immediately, if there is no hot swelling or abscess in the place, and in that case, apply something which settles the abscess and removes the swelling to it; and leave that for some days; and afterward you may tighten the splints on it.
And let the splints be of half of a smoothed peeled cane, and skillfully formed; or they may be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint that is placed over that fracture be a little thicker and smoother than the other splints, and the length of the splint be according to the size of the limb, large or small; and then tighten another bandage over the splints according to your first tightening; and then tie it up neatly with thread as we have said regarding tightening, which is that your tightening should be greater at the location of the fracture itself, and the further away it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fineness, and made of flax; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen through the practice of some fools placing their threads of twisted hemp cords, that is a great error, because the tightening is uneven.
And likewise, thin threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve what you want by tightening with them, and there should not be less than a finger's width between splint and splint.
And if the patient is hurt by the ends of the splints near the bandaging in those places, then put some tow flax or carded wool underneath them so that this does not cause him injury.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a rupture occurs in the skin, and I will come back to this point in the second chapter with a detailed explanation.
And know that not every broken limb is bound with splints on the first day; the reason being that when the limb is large, you should not place splints on it until after five or seven days or more, depending on your certainty regarding the development of a hot abscess/swelling.
And this is the method of plasters with which the Ancients performed restorations, which are placed on fractures and dislocations and sprains.
Method of a common abbreviated plaster for the restoration of a fracture, suitable for many complexions and especially for women and children, because it is something on which neither heat nor cold comes: and it is that you take mill dust, which is the marrow of the flour that hangs from the movement of the millstone on the walls of the mill.
And prepare it as is, only sieve it with egg white, and make the mixture neither thick nor thin; then use it.
Another method of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and sprain: take of asafoetida, of labdanum, of acacia, of elecampane, and migrach, which is the root of wild pomegranate, of all ten drams; of myrrh and aloe each five drams; of aloe vera twenty drams; let all be ground and sieved and mixed with aloe water or with egg white if the patient's complexion is heated; then use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores broken bones easily, and suits many people.
Another method of plaster which suits fracture and sprain: take migrach (wild pomegranate root) and marshmallow root, each ten drams; of myrrh and of aloe each five drams; of acacia six drams; of Armenian bole twenty drams.
Let all be ground in a mortar with much grinding, and be sieved, and be mixed with water or with egg white and be administered.
Method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and which soothes pain occurring in them and in fissures and fractures: take dirty wool and submerge it in sour wine and cooked oil and place it on the area/location.
But in this plaster there is no power of restoration, of hot abscess and it expels pains properly/effectively.
Another method of plaster that restores broken bone: take leaves of a wild fig tree and leaves of wild poppy; grind it all and make a plaster from them.
A shortened method of plaster administered after the restoration of a bone fracture and when you want resolution of the remainder of an abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile and violet flowers, and orach flour, one part of each; let all be ground and mixed with wine, if the limb is not heated/inflamed.
But if it is heated/inflamed, then mix it with juice of coriander or with water and use it.
Another method of plaster, stronger in resolution than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs after the restoration of the limb: take roots of marshmallow and linseed, and pomegranate rind, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, one equal part of each; let all be ground and mixed with willow water or with fresh water or with wine, all this according to the condition of the limb and the return of its color.
But Hippocrates did not say in his book that anything be placed on the broken limb after its restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommended that it be medium in thickness, between thick and thin.
But in Gaul it is seen that things are placed on the broken limb after its restoration, things in which there is desiccation with a little heat, such as myrrh, frankincense, and similar things which we have mentioned.
Method of plaster that you will make for injury and pain: take breadcrumbs, wax, shaved human hair or bird feathers, marshmallow, and salt, equal parts; let them be ground and sieved and mixed, and let a plaster be made.
But the length of time that the bandage should remain and when it should be loosened is as follows: consider if there is no pain or itching and if the broken bone has not moved from its place, then you do not loosen it for many days. And if severe pain or itching or swelling occurs at the site, then you hasten to loosen it immediately, and remove the plaster from it.
And take a linen cloth and a wet sea sponge, and submerge it in warm water, and with that wash the area until the itching stops and the pain is soothed; and then let the limb rest for an hour; and then place upon it clean wool submerged in sour wine and oil or rose oil, and bind it on overnight until you are sure of a warm abscess, and that the swelling of the limb is reduced, and the pain from it is removed.
And then repeat that light binding and small plaster and do not tighten it as much as your first binding, and continue with this until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess and the redness and the pain and the swelling and all the symptoms are completely gone, and there is no need for plaster and bandaging, then you repeat the procedure as you did at the beginning, equally.
And if none of the things we have mentioned happen to the limb, then do not loosen it for about three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all of this is left for twenty days, depending on what you observe with the loosening of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and the flesh coagulates over it.
And then tighten the bandaging more than your first bandaging, and increase the richness of the patient's food, as was previously mentioned concerning him/her.
But if you see that the site of the fracture has dried and thinned out more than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it; and therefore bathe it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it; and do this every three days; and loosen the bandaging a little, and through this procedure nourishment will flow to the limb, and it is easily healed.
But what foolish bone-setters do, setting a fractured limb a second time when it wasn't set correctly at the beginning, and is set crookedly, is a mistake in their practice, and a great risk, and if it were correct the Ancients would have emphasized this in their books and would have practiced it.
And I have not seen any of them do this, so it is more reasonable not to do it.
Chapter Two: On fractures when they occur in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and the blow drives the entire bone into the brain, which is below the bone, just like an axe does in wood, and therefore this type is called a depression fracture ["ascial" likely relates to axe/adze]; or the sword cuts some part of the bone, and cuts the flesh there but the incision does not pass through to the inside of it; and this type of fracture is called a simple incision/superficial wound [literally, "absolute lifting/raising"].
And the damage of these two fractures is either great or small, as is a fracture that is a contusion or bruise; and its cause is a blow with a stone or a fall on a rock, and things like them.
And this fracture is either penetrating, which then approaches the membrane which is below the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the damage of these two fractures is either great or small.
And there is a fracture that is a hairline crack in the bone, as fine as a hair, and therefore this type is called a hairline fracture [literally "capillary fracture"].
And there is a fracture that is made either by a fall or by a blow from a stone or similar things, which causes some layer of the bone to go into the inner parts, and a concavity is made in the place, just as happens to copper pots when they are struck and part of them is driven inwards.
And this happens especially in the bodies with damp bones, such as the heads of children.
And there are also all these kinds of fractures [or: And common to all these kinds of fractures are], which are fragments like separated stars/splinters. And I will return with an explanation [or: further discussion] of all this in its proper place.
And we recognize all these kinds of fractures by touching them and by examining them with probes and [by the presence of] damaged flesh that is over them.
And a hairline fracture is recognized because it is uncovered over the bone, and [the bone] is cleaned, and wiped over with a probe, for the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of a fracture, consider first the patient's condition, and then if you see, because of these conditions, manifest signs indicating danger, such as vomiting of bile, and distension, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and similarly [swelling] of the eyes and redness of them, and similar major symptoms, without doubt he will not be healed.
And if you see no unfavorable symptoms, you may hope for recovery, then you may begin his treatment.
The reason for this is that if the injured person comes to you at the beginning of the injury and this is during the winter, then you should attend to the setting of the bone before the fourteenth day, according to the specific situation.
And if it is during the summer days, then you must take care to set the bone before the seventh day, provided that what is under the bone is not corrupted from inflammation, and that the complications that we have mentioned do not occur.
And if the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and it is with small fragments and attrition, then you must excise the comminuted and damaged part, as I will explain to you.
And you should shave the head of the injured patient, and uncover the bone as is customary and possible for you, according to the shape of the wound, and be gentle with the patient.
And if you encounter, after the uncovering of the bone, blood flow or a hot abscess, then you should treat it appropriately.  Fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess has subsided, and you are sure of the cessation of bleeding; then begin with the scraping around the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow chisel, of this shape: [referring to a missing illustration] And then use another chisel, a little wider than the first; and this is its shape: [referring to a missing illustration]
And then use the widest chisel.
And you should have a number of different chisels, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than the others and should be sharpened at their ends, and be made of Indian or hardened steel.
And use them with ease when striking the chisel so that you don't damage the head [of the chisel, presumably] and injure it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then you should drill around it before you use the chisels with the drills, which are called shallow drills.
And they are so named because they do not reach from the surface of the skull bone to what is beneath it, because the drill has a round extremity or margin above which is a sharp head resembling a margin or small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is fitting that you take a large number of these drills, each one appropriate for the thickness of each bone, until you have for all skulls a [drill whose] end is sharp, and whose length is according to the thickness of that skull.
And this is the way of [using] three kinds of drills: The method of drilling around the fractured bone is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated; and then move the drill to another spot, placing it between each hole a distance about the thickness of a spoke of a wheel or about that.
And then cut with chisels what is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as you can for lightness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with some other means or some instruments which you will have prepared for this, such as tongs and fine forceps.
And you must take every precaution that the chisel does not touch any part of the brain covering (dura mater).
And then when you have circled the perforated bone, and it is separated from the dura mater if it is connected to it, and you have extracted it, you must scrape and smooth the roughness of the bone remaining with another instrument similar to a chisel, but it should be thinner and finer than the other chisels.
And if any part of the small, fractured bones remains, then remove it carefully with the instruments you have; and then treat the wound with bandages and ointments which we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is less invasive, far from fear, which Guy de Chauliac praised and lauded greatly; and this is his explanation:  It is necessary for you in the beginning to start uncovering the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe and most obvious, until, when you have uncovered that part, you place under it the end of this slow and gentle chisel, of which this is the form:
And the lenticular (lens-shaped) part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is on the other two sides extending lengthwise, as you see; so that the lenticular part is placed next to the dura mater with the sharp side cutting into the bone.
And then strike the chisel on one side with a small mallet until you cut through the entire bone gently as it is rotated, and you are certain about the membrane (dura mater) that no accident will happen to it in any way that you fear, even if the physician were the most foolish and ignorant of all men; certainly, even if he were sleeping.
Then if anything remains attached to the bone from the dura mater in any place on the bone, you will cut it away from it with the end of that lenticular chisel, and free it gently, for it is freed without harm and without fear.
And if the bone fracture does not penetrate to the dura mater, and what is cut off or removed from the bone is its surface, and roughness and fine splinters remain, then you must scrape that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps that you have prepared in number, of various sizes so that you can use the most appropriate ones in every place and the most suitable ones according to how your operation leads you on that broken bone and its shape.
And you must manage your scraping so that at the beginning you scrape the bone with the widest of those rasps, and then gradually use the finest ones, and don't stop doing this continuously until you get to using the thinnest and finest of them all.
But in each of the other small, hair-like fractures and fine breaks, you must administer care as required to correct it/them.
And it is a topic that is not sufficiently addressed by all those who have studied this art. And stay with what we have shown written about large fractures.
And if the membrane is retained when you scrape the bone, then you must take a cloth according to the size of the wound and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound; and then take another cloth, folded double or triple, and submerge it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth, and do this as lightly as you can so you don't burden the pericranium; and then apply a broad bandage over that, and do not tighten it except enough to just hold the wound covering in place.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure of a warm abscess; and then untie it and apply medicines with which excess dryness is removed, such as linseed roots and orris-root powder, and powders of incense and birthwort, and things similar to these.
And you should make a powder of these medicines and sprinkle it on the wound, just as they are dry; and generally, apply any medicine whose property it is to cleanse and not to irritate.
And be careful, according to your ability, that the wound in your care is clean; and that there is no filth of ointment or other [substance] in it; nor should you allow virulence to gather in it; for when it is next to the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and a malignant sickness soon falls upon the patient.
And it happens in the pericranium of the head, when the bone is cleaned of it, and especially when its treatment is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and then if those accidents we have mentioned happen to the patient, you should know that it is deadly without any doubt.
And if the blackness doesn't occur except from the medicine that is placed on it, and it is the effect of that medicine that causes that blackness, then you must take one part honey and three parts rose oil, and smear a cloth with them, and then place it on the pericranium; and then treat it with the appropriate healing spices until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that only the two uppermost parts of the nose are broken together, or sometimes one of them, because you have two bones there, for the lower part is cartilaginous, and is not broken and only suffers bruising, twisting, and curvature.
But if one of the two parts is broken, then you must insert your little finger into his nose, and align that fracture from the inside with your index finger, and with the thumb on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this gently, and be careful not to cause the patient pain through your work.
And if the fracture is in the uppermost part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach it, then it should be adjusted with the end of a probe which is small in thickness.
And if the fracture is in both parts, then you do the same.
And attend to its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the seventh or tenth day you should beware of hot swelling/inflammation.  (The word "apostema" generally refers to an abscess or swelling caused by infection.  In this context, it seems to warn against increased inflammation arising from the fracture around a week to ten days later.)
And then insert into the end of the nose a linen cloth wick, if the fracture is in one part, or put in two tubes/plugs, if the fracture is in two parts, and the tube/plug should be thick enough to fill the hole of the nose. (The word "calgua" is likely related to modern words like "calque" and refers to something inserted, perhaps a small tube or plug.)
And some of the ancient healers said that the tubes/plugs should be soaked in butter and changed every day, but this is not my opinion; on the other hand, it is necessary that the wick be soaked in egg white mixed with ground flour; and then leave the tube/plug in until the bone is set and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a tube/plug, a goose feather is inserted into the nose, after it has been wrapped in fine linen cloth; and it may be that you have a more severe nasal fracture and that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this [the goose feather method] isn't necessary for you; if you want, do it this way, and if you want, use tubes/plugs.
And if a hot abscess sometimes occurs, plaster the nose with wax or with cotton soaked in sour wine and rose oil, or with diachylon plaster.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then you must plaster it externally with sesame flour and incense powder mixed with egg white; and then place fine lint on it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the nasal bones are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted (splintered), then you must make an incision over them, and extract them with suitable instruments; and then sew up the incision, and treat it with something that promotes flesh growth and consolidation, and with appropriate plasters.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then you must treat it with plugs/tubes and administer lead cannulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
On the restoration of the mandible when it is broken/fractured.
When the mandible below is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, see then if the fracture is only external, and it is not broken in two and curved inwards, then its recognition is easy/straightforward.
And it is necessary then, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is on the left mandible, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and with that, push the bump/protrusion of the inwards fracture easily to the outside, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; gently aligning it with that (other hand/the outside).
And if the fracture of the mandible is already separated in two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from both sides along a straight line until its alignment is possible.
And if loosening/displacement of the teeth occurs with the break, then tighten those which you hope will remain with gold or silver or silk thread; and then place a plaster/bandage on the broken mandible, and then place folded cloth over it, and place over the cloth a suitably made large star (shaped bandage), or a piece of leather equal to the length of the mandible; and then tie it on top according to how you have prepared the bandage and as the application requires, until it (the fracture) is healed.
And order the patient to rest and be tranquil, and have him take his food in sips/small amounts.
And if you judge that its shape has been altered in any way, then take care and untie it on the third day; and then correct what has been altered in it (the bandage) and plaster it with powder of melilot, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the plaster/bandage from it, and place soft wool over the plaster.
And then when that plaster is attached and adjusted on it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, and do not untie it until it is healed and the fracture is firm; for many times this fracture is set in three weeks.
And if again a hot abscess/swelling occurs, then administer what we have said many times for its reduction until it is healed, and the abscess/swelling is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of the bone is separated or splintered, then you should carefully remove those splinters with what is suitable for this purpose among the instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with the lancet according to the extent of your need. (Fleubotomi is likely a variant of phleubotomy - the act of opening a vein to let blood, but seemingly used here for any incision).
And then when you have removed those splinters, and nothing of them remains, then you should sew the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters that is suitable for this and allow it to heal, until it is cured.
Chapter 5.
On the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken. (Furcula refers to the "little fork," which is an anatomical term for the clavicle.)
Many times the clavicle is broken in the front part near the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
For either it is broken, or separated, or it is separated into two parts without any splinters; and it is easy to restore; or it happens that splinters occur, and it is difficult to restore; or it is the case that the fracture is with a wound.
And the procedure in this case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the patient and follows the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards that side.
And then align the fracture with your fingers until its proper form is restored, so that there is neither a small protrusion nor a concavity.
And if you need more extension, then you should place a ball of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit, and its size should be according to your need; and extend and elevate the clavicle and compress the ball with your hand until you align the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards, because it has reached the throat, then it is necessary that the patient lie supine with their neck bent back, and you place a moderately sized cushion on their shoulder muscle.
And the assistant should press the shoulder muscle downwards so that the bone of the clavicle that is near the throat is raised, and then you adjust the fracture and align it with your fingers.
But if you feel bone fragments of the clavicle that are loose, then you should make an incision over it and extract those fragments with care/ease.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you should make an incision on it with one of the incisors that you have prepared for this, after having placed under the clavicle the instrument that supports the nape of the neck; and it is an instrument of wood or iron, of which this is the form/shape:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the cavity/concavity; and its width should be according to your need for it, depending on the size of the bone or its smallness.
But its length should be as long as possible for the operation; it should have two ends as you see, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound, which you have incised when you extracted the bone fragment, is large, and there is risk of a hot abscess/infection, then you should join the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess/infection, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound opening/tear.
And if a hot abscess/infection occurs, then soak a cloth in sour wine and rose oil and wine, and place it over the area.
And ensure that the splint is not moved from over the broken bone; and therefore you must see the patient every day, so that when the bandaging is loosened or you see that the splint has moved, then you correct it and tighten the bandage.
And then arrange the patient's sleeping position on his neck (meaning, have him sleep somewhat upright), and place a small cushion under his armpit on the side of the injury during the night; so that with this the injured side is raised, and thus the fracture of the clavicle is elevated by the elevation of the muscle; or else his arm should be tied to his neck.
And do not loosen the bandage unless itching or an abscess occurs at the site, within twelve days.
And then renew the plaster if you see the need for it, and adjust the bandaging and restore it and leave it until the fracture of the clavicle is restored and healed.
And it is strengthened and restored within a month, in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
On the restoration of a fractured shoulder.
The shoulder blade is broken in its broad part and only the edges are broken.
And so when its location is broken — and it is broken in its middle — and it is known only by touch, then according to the shape of the fracture, endeavor to prepare it and reduce it to its natural shape in every ingenious way that is possible for you.
Then apply powder of ground spelt with egg white and tow [flax fiber] to the area; and then apply a folded cloth powder; and then apply a thin, tin-plated sheet of metal over it, according to the size of the whole shoulder blade, or a little more.
But if beneath, the plate is concave in any of the places of the shoulder blade, then you fill that concavity with tow, and then place the plate evenly.
And then tightly bind it above with long bandages, with appropriate constriction and firm placement of the plate so that it is not moved from its place.
And check the bandage every day; and whenever it is loosened, bind it again and tighten it and adjust the plate if it is moved from its place.
And have the patient lie on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And then when this number of days is complete, you dissolve/remove the bandage, and you should know for certain because this concerns bones whose joining is not feared nor their dissolution/separation.
And if you proceed from the location of the weighty bone and place the chain underneath, then you cut above it, and remove it, and do as we have said regarding the fracture of the collarbone from the evacuation of an abscess if it occurs there.
Chapter 7.
On the restoration/treatment of the fracture of the feet.
The foot is sometimes broken in its middle and this heals slowly; but its extremities are often crushed and comminuted (splintered/broken into small pieces).
And among the accidents/complications when the middle of the foot is broken are that it deviates/bends inwards and causes great pain, and difficulty in breathing, and cough, and very easily one vomits blood; and a cavity/gap in the broken bone is evident and is not hidden to the touch.
And its treatment/restoration is that the patient should be laid on their back, and a cushion placed between their shoulders; and then press on their muscles, and adjust their ribs with your hands on both sides, and be subtle/gentle in your operation/treatment and in the setting, according to every way that is possible for this and that is appropriate to it, until the shape of the bone returns as it should.
And then place a plaster and tow/padding on it and place on top a splint of thin willow or boxwood or similar light material, after you have wrapped it in cloth; and then be careful in tying it over the broken bone so that it is not moved; and go with the bandage sometimes around/circling the back/top, and tighten it with a suitable tightness; and then check the bandage constantly, and when it is loosened, tighten it.
And if necessity requires its untying, whether from chafing or itching, or pain, or an abscess that occurs in the area, then you should carefully untie it and remove the plaster and correct whatever occurs from this with a method of healing it; and then reapply the plaster, if you see the need for it; and adjust the tightness until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
Of the restoration/treatment of ribs when they are broken/fractured.
Know that fracture of the ribs only occurs in the thick places that follow the back; and at their front extremities, no crushing occurs except because they are cartilaginous. And recognizing it is not hidden from feeling/touch through examination with the fingers.
And the restoration/treatment should be done as follows: align the fracture with the fingers as much as possible, until it is aligned as it should be, and then apply a plaster and bind the broken bone with a splint, if you need one.
And if the rib fracture is pointing inwards, then the patient experiences intense pain and a piercing sensation, similar to the pain experienced by someone with pleurisy, because the bone pricks the membrane/pleura; and the patient has difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting a lot of blood; and this is difficult to treat/cure.
And the Ancients were indeed ingenious with that, with many devices/inventions.
And about them, I say this: it is necessary that you give the patient foods that cause swelling and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and distended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we would avoid this because it is a considerable cause for creating/generating a hot abscess, unless it occurs naturally; and if it does occur, then it is already helping the situation.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed over it and then strongly sucked; and it seems reasonable, but nevertheless it is feared that the cupping glass will attract superfluous fluids/humors to the area due to the weakness (of the tissues).
And some of them said: it is necessary that the area be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil, and that cushions/pads be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandaging is equal when you wrap it around according to the roundness/contour; and then the patient should be treated with the care/treatment for pleurisy, with respect to food and medicine.
And if a severe cause constricts the patient which he cannot bear, and the bone punctures the membrane with a damaging puncture, and we fear for the patient, then it is necessary that we cut over the area, uncover the broken rib, and then place over it the instrument that preserves the membrane, the description of which has been given previously, and that we incise the bone easily/gently, and extract it.
And then we should join the two lips/edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitching, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess/internal ulcer develops inside, then you should take and soak pads/cushions in rose oil and place (them) over the area, and the patient should be treated as is appropriate for an internal abscess/ulcer.
And he should lie on his back, on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
On the restoration of a fracture of the spine of the back and neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and subsequently suffers attrition/wearing away, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider this: for if you see his hands already softened, numb, and dead, and he cannot move them, nor extend nor clench them, and when you squeeze them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and he feels no pain in them, then know that he is not healed, and in most cases, his condition is fatal.
And if he moves them and feels the squeezing with your fingers and the pricking, then know that the spinal cord/nape of the bone is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if the same thing occurs in the vertebrae of the neck and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then examine his feet.
Then, if you see that they are already softened, the same thing happens to them as happened in the hands. Further, when he lies on his back, he experiences flatulence and bowel movements involuntarily, and sometimes when he lies supine on his back and wants to urinate, he cannot. Then, you should know that his case is fatal, and therefore, do not work on his treatment/cure.
But if none of these things occur, the case is better and easier.
And his treatment is that you strive for the reduction of the hot abscess that you place on the injured vertebra with rose oil alone, or with enough egg yolks. Apply this to it several times a day until the hot abscess is reduced.
And then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, and tighten it with a bandage; and instruct the patient to rest and be tranquil, and not to sleep on the affected side/part until he is healed.
And if it happens that due to the bone fracture, a fragment or something is separated from it, then it is necessary that you cut to the bone and remove that bone fragment; and then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures if it is large; and then treat that with some incarnative (flesh-generating) ointment until it is healed.
But if the back of the tailbone is broken, and it is the end of the coccyx, then you should insert the little finger of your left hand into the anus, and align the broken bone with your other hand as much as possible by a second setting/reduction; and then apply a plaster and a splint, if you consider them necessary, and then tighten it.
And if you feel broken bone fragments in it, then operate on it, and remove that, and treat the wound with the aforementioned treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
On the restoration of the hip.
The hip bones are rarely broken, and if they break, then their fracture is only a splitting at their extremities, and they are incised lengthwise and deviate inward; and the patient experiences pain and pricking in the area, and the leg is numb when fractured.
And its restoration is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture which has the form.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you adjust it according to what is apparent to you for proper alignment until it resembles its natural form.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or deviates downwards, then you have the patient lie on their stomach so that the restoration of that fracture can be prepared. And then when you have aligned it, apply a plaster over it, and then place a splint of wood or leather on top of that, and tighten it firmly so that you don't fear puncture from the fracture or movement of the splint.
And adjust the hollow area by filling it in so that it takes the binding evenly, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease extending and restoring it until the hot abscess has subsided, and apply something that soothes it as described before; and then return to its restoration and bind it as is necessary.
And if there are cracks or comminuted fractures in the bones, then you treat them. (Or perhaps, "then you extract/remove them," depending on the precise meaning of "tratz" in this context.)
Chapter 11.
On the restoration of a fracture of the clavicle (or possibly "shoulder blade," depending on the precise meaning of "adjutori" in this medical context – it could refer to a bone that "aids" arm movement).
The *adjutori* is that which is between the elbow and the top of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is done in one of two ways, one of which is that you take a flat piece of wood of moderate thickness according to this shape:
And at the two ends two ties should be attached, and then it should be suspended from a raised location/place.
And have the patient sit on a chair; then extend their broken arm over the wood until it reaches its end, in the middle of which the curve of the wood should be placed. (Implying the curve accommodates the elbow.)
And then suspend some heavy object over that, or have the assistant extend it downwards; and then the physician should align the fracture with their hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that the patient should lie on their back and suspend their hand from their neck with a tie; then instruct two assistants, one of them to hold the part above the fracture with their hands; and the other to hold the part below it; and each of them should extend it towards themselves.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you tighten above the fracture with a tie and above that with another tie, and each of the two assistants extends toward their respective side.
And so if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is necessary to place half of the tie above the elbow and the other below the fracture towards the shoulder.  (Or possibly "towards the inside of the elbow" depending on the exact meaning of "coyde.")
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that the tie be placed above that place and above that elbow.
Align it with ease and without force, and then when it is aligned as it should be and applied with a good application, then tighten it unless a hot swelling (abscess/inflammation) occurs.
But if a hot swelling (abscess/inflammation) occurs, then loosen the bandaging until the seventh day, and place upon it clean wool soaked in sour wine and rose oil until the swelling subsides, and then tighten it.
And the way to tighten it is that you place a plaster over the fracture, and then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm on that support, and place his hand open on his muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the arm against the support so that the arm is in a star-shaped position, unless something about the broken bone prevents this.
And then use splints.
And place over the fracture the splint that is the widest and strongest of the other splints; and leave between each splint the width of a finger, and the length of the splints should be according to the break with an addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten over the splints with the bandage that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And your bandaging over the site of the fracture should be tighter. And the further away the bandaging is from the fracture, the looser it should be.
And so, if you see the placement of the splints and the bandaging as we have described at the moment when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you do [as follows/proceed].
And if you fear a hot abscess, then you leave the bandaging and the splints in place for seven days, as we have said.
And then examine the bandaging on all sides for three days so that itching or swelling does not occur in the area; or [so that] food is not prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the bandaging; and so correct all of this according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not untie the bandage for about three days or more.
And let the patient sleep on their back, with their hands on their stomach.
And place a cooked dressing filled with wool evenly over it, and ensure at all hours of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not distorted or dissolved, or that the bandage is softened, so correct all of this with your skill.
And administer the patient's food according to the order that we have previously mentioned, so that the food is light at the beginning until [the bone] begins to knit together; and then you should increase the richness of their food.
For it is usual for the dressing and his leg to be bound for forty days; and then they should be untied, and a bath administered, and medicated with ointments that heal it.
And if the fracture is severely bruised, then you do not remove the bandage and splints from it for fifty days or for two months.
Chapter 12.
On the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two *focils*; of which one is small, and it is the one located by the thumb, and the other is large and is the one placed under the smaller one, in the lower part.  (Note: "focils" likely refers to the radius and ulna.)
And it is very easy to break the larger *focil* only, or the smaller one, and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small *focil* is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is faster.
And when the *focil* is broken below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the small *focil* above, then it is fitting for the physician, after its restoration, to apply a small extension gently until it is aligned.
But if the large *focil* is what is broken, then it is necessary to apply more forceful extension.
And if both *focils* are broken together, then you must apply the extension much more strongly.
And it is necessary that you place the hand (in a specific position) after its reduction and extension, laid out on a cushion, and the wrist should be at the uppermost part, higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be lying on a square chair/stool.
And there should be a cushion in front of him at his height or behind him so that the patient does not experience discomfort/difficulty.
And then the assistant should extend the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant should similarly extend from above.
And then the physician should adjust the bone until he reduces it to the best possible position.
And if there is bleeding in the bone fracture, then you must reduce every piece to its place with your skill.
And if separated bleeding appears there that punctures the skin and there is no hope for its restoration, then you should act upon it and remove it according to the method we have described above.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter for this, so take the treatment from that.
And if a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your treatment, then you should line a cloth with a cerate made of rose oil and white wax, and it should be middling between thickness and thinness, and tightly wrap the cloth over it with gentle pressure until the abscess subsides; and then remove the cerate and apply a plaster prepared from ground flour with egg white, and then apply splints; and the splint that is placed over that fracture should be the widest and strongest.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in the most serious situations, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
And then apply your bandaging over the location of the fracture most strongly and firmly, and as the bandaging gets further from the parts above the fracture or to the parts below it, apply the bandaging a little more loosely according to what was mentioned previously at the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture should be soft, damp cloths, and they should not be hard or rough, and the thread with which it is tied should itself be of a middling thickness between thin and thick, as we have recounted.
And examine the limb and the bandaging after a few days. And if any issue arises which needs correcting, such as itching which occurs on the limb, then you need to bathe the limb with warm water until that itching stops.
And leave the limb unbound until it rests, and then reapply the bandaging.
And if the dressing is now softened and the bone has moved again and suchlike, then correct all of that with your skill.
And consider further if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the bandaging, for then you must loosen it a little and leave it so for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it.
But if none of the things we have mentioned occur to the patient, then it does not need to be untied for about twenty days or thereabouts.
And then the patient's hand should be suspended by its own power of voluntary movement, and have him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or very quickly in twenty-eight days, and all this is according to the disposition of the complexions and the strength of the constitution.
Chapter .xiii. (or Chapter 13)
On the restoration of a fracture of the thumb and fingers.
Know that fractures rarely occur in the thumb and the knuckles of the fingers, and what happens to them more often is bruising.
And when a fracture or bruise occurs in the hand, then it is necessary that the patient sits down and in front of him you arrange a pillow evenly, and then place his hand on it, extended.
And then the assistant extends the broken bones and the physician aligns them until they are joined with good alignment/joined well.
And then it is necessary to apply a plaster and padding, unless a hot abscess/inflammation occurs; and then apply a splint over it according to the size of the area, after you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the break is on the inner parts/towards the palm of the hand, then make a ball-like shape of cloth, and tell the patient to squeeze it with his broken palm/hand; then have it tightened/bound with a long cloth.
And there should be a splint made of leather with cloth in/on which it is raised, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tighten it as needed.
But if the fracture is on the outer parts/back of the hand, then it is necessary to apply a splint over it and another splint from below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the bandage, just as the hand is tilted towards the small finger among the fingers with bandages/ties.
And if a fracture happens to any of the finger joints/knuckles, then if it is the thumb, it should be made even/aligned as needed and then be bound/held against the palm and, if you wish, apply a small straight splint to it so that the fracture is elevated and cannot be moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle finger, or the index finger, or the little finger, or the ring finger, then it should be aligned and bound with the finger next to it; or they can all be bound together in a row, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your treatment, and therefore apply it, the characteristics of a hot abscess and treat it — with your work — with what is needed when any of these things occur, as its description/explanation has been repeated.
Chapter 14.
On the treatment of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken, and it is evident to the touch depending on whether it is displaced towards the front or the upper part/outer surface.
And its treatment is done thus: a bandage is tightened above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the patient should be lying prone (on their stomach) and face down.
And then the practitioner should extend the entire bandage in its respective direction, according to the nature of the injury, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the hip joint, then the bandage should be near the groin towards the pubic area, so that the extension pulls upward, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is close to the knee, then the bandage should be made close to the knee, and the extension should be downwards/toward the lower parts.
And then the physician aligns the bones with both his hands until it is returned to its natural form and the bone is joined in proper alignment; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, unless an abscess develops on the limb. But if an abscess develops there, then you leave it for a few days until the heat of the abscess has subsided, and then return to your treatment.
The bandaging should be done like this: it is necessary to wrap a firm bandage over the fracture, and double it two or three times, and remove the excess; and then wrap the leg until you reach the ankle and the hip joint.
And insert a long splint between the thigh and the leg near the knee downwards, and bring the ends of the splint from the highest part on both sides, and then wrap over the leg and thigh that which is superfluous from the bandage.
And then place splints on the thigh at the location of the fracture, and place one of these splints on the bones of the leg.
And then fill the empty spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandaging is padded.
And then begin with tight bandaging in the middle, over the location of the fracture, with three or four wraps, and the further you move with the bandaging from the location of the fracture, your bandaging should be less and lighter and softer.
And then extend the two ends of the splint downwards until it reaches the ankle of the foot, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandaging is not moved from its place.
And then leave the bandaging on it, but in such a way that neither corrosion nor hot swelling or inflammation and things similar to these occur to the limb; and if any of these things occur, then quickly undo the bandaging, and correct what has happened immediately, according to what we have said many times.
But if in the bone there is a piece of bone which protrudes, then you must straighten it as much as is possible for you; and if not, work upon it and replace it, and treat it with that which has been mentioned before until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is tightened other than by splints being adjusted to it, as we have described in regard to the shoulder and the arm.
But however, in the restoration of it done in such a manner the patient doesn't develop lameness; but if it is restored alone, without the other leg being applied to it, then it is inevitable that he will always limp.
And know that the thigh is strengthened in forty days or a little more or a little less, and all this is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
On the restoration of a fracture of the kneecap.
Know that fracture of the kneecap happens late/rarely, but contusion often occurs to it.
But if a fracture happens to it, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a wound, and over all of this there has been sensation/feeling.
And its restoration is thus: that which is broken of its parts should be aligned with the said (instruments/methods) until it is joined and connected as much as possible through equalization, facilitation, and fabrication/making.
And then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you need one; and tighten it from above with a bandage suitable for this.
And then consider all the arrangements that we have recounted in the other fractures, such as a hot abscess and things similar to them, so that you may oppose every complication with what is suitable to it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
On the restoration of a fracture of the leg.
Know that in the leg there are two bones of which one is large, and is called by the name of the leg (tibia); and the other is slender, and is called fibula.
And it happens with each of the types of fracture that which happens to the two bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done just like the restoration of the arm, and the procedure for it is the same.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is turned in all directions (or distorted).
And if the more slender bone is broken, the leg is turned towards the front.
And if the larger bone is broken, you will find that one underneath, and it is among those cases that are not hidden from you.
Then administer extension and setting (or alignment) and binding of the splints in the same manner.
But it is necessary, however, if the fracture of the leg is large and there are many injuries, that the extension be less and lighter, and ease it with your skill.
And in the leg there is some similarity of procedure to the arm, and it is when you align the splints and complete all of your work, then you will take pieces of pine wood which are placed under the thighs which are placed on sheets, and are made likewise of palm branches; choose those of small thickness, and not at all from the knotted parts, and their length should be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the heel.
And then wrap each one in cloth with two windings along its length, and place one on the side of the leg on one part and the other on the other part, and they should be from the knee to the lowest place of the foot.
And then tie the two splints in three places, at the two ends and in the middle, for with this binding the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left side, and it remains in a good position.
And a wooden splint has already been prepared according to the length of the leg; and let the leg be placed on it so that it keeps it from movement.
And especially you should do this in a fracture, and when with that there is a proper wound.
And then examine the leg every day and study it with due diligence, and watch for abscesses and swelling or other similar things; and if any of these things occur, then attend to it with what is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
On the fracture of the heel and the bones of the foot and the toes.
The heel bone does not typically fracture completely; but the bones of the foot may fracture sometimes; and the toes rarely fracture, experiencing only contusions in most cases.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and you see that these bones are displaced, then have the patient place their foot on the ground as if walking.
Then place one foot on the elevated part of those bones, and then press down and even them out until they return to their places.
Then apply a plaster and padding on top, and place a small splint with two flat ends under the arch of the foot.
And then tighten it against the foot with a suitable bandage after you have wrapped it with cloths and other necessary things.
And when three or four days have passed, then you untie the bandage, for you will find the bones aligned, whether they were broken or dislocated, and the procedure for them is as you know.
But if someone says they are broken, then restore them and align them as I have explained to you in the restoration of the said hand. Then apply a splint to the broken toe, according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider than it; and then place under the foot this board which I have mentioned to you, and tighten it with a suitable bandage.
But if two, three, or more bones are broken, then you place a splint of the appropriate size, wrapped in linen cloth, on each toe, and tighten the board at the bottom of the foot, and let one end of the board extend beyond the sole of the foot so that it holds it with good retention.
And it is fitting for you not to forget to consider all the things which I have told you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose every accident with what is appropriate.
Chapter 18.
On the fracture of the woman's vulva and the pubic bone and the man's penis.
When the woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit in a square chair, then incline her a little to one side, and let her be held from behind.
And then let the midwife fill the vulva with cotton, and let it be done in her vulva like a ball; and then let the woman be shaken, and raise her buttocks little by little, because everything is thrown out until it is in front of the vulva like a ball and the broken bone returns.
And then place cushions on her buttocks, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton with ease and then she urinates, and replace and return it in the manner in which you placed it at the beginning, and then return to her first cushion.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for it is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tighten a reed cannula over its opening; and insert the entire bladder into her vulva, and then blow forcefully into the cannula until the bladder is inflated inside the vulva, for the fracture will return (to place).
And then let it be filled with cotton and remain for some days as we have recounted, until it is healed.
And when the pubic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and splinting what we have described for the hip bone.
And what is correct is not hidden in these nearby fractures which rarely occur, especially for him who has some study and use and understands these words of my book; for that fracture indicates to you in most cases the correct way in its restoration and binding, and therefore understand well.
But when the penis of a man is broken, take the windpipe of a goose, and place the penis in it; then place a wrap of cloth over it, and let it be bandaged, and then let it be left for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
On the restoration of bone fractures when there is a plague/infection/disease.  (The word "plagua" can have several meanings, so context from the upcoming sentences will refine it).
It is fitting for him who suffers a fracture with infection (plagua seems to mean infection here), especially if the bone is large such as the thigh bone or the hip bone, or similar to it, that you attend to and phlebotomize (bleed) him immediately if the conditions for phlebotomy so indicate, as we have said above.
And if the infection discharges blood, then it is necessary that you attend to stopping it/its retention thus: you should sprinkle ground burnt alum over it, if no other remedy is available to you.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not prolong/delay this, unless an abscess occurs/develops.
But if a hot abscess occurs/develops, then you should leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for you will cause bad complications to arise.
But if the broken bone is protruding and exposed above the skin, then it is necessary that you endeavor to reduce it and align it with your hands gently and with little extension/pulling.
But if you are not prepared for extension and its alignment with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and it is an instrument which is made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight fingers and the width of which is according to the size of the wound/affected area; and for this it is necessary for the physician to have three or four of these depending on the amount needed for this treatment in all sorts of fractures.
And let it be round, and let it have little thickness so that it may not bend under pressure during the operation.
And let it be of sharp extremity, which should have a margin at its ends/edges; and let its top be tending towards thickness, and from its middle towards the ends/parts.
And this is its form/shape:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", that is, small spatula/blade.
Because it is necessary that its sharp elevated extremity be placed on the extremity of the protruding bone.
And push it in one go until the bone returns and is leveled with some balance/alignment.
And then strive to align the ends of the fracture with each other, and if the end of the broken bone is thin, and the instrument does not grip it well, then you must incise the end of that bone until the instrument can grip it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have described, then incise it with what is suitable for it from the incisors which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient experiences intensely sharp pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do this for you would confer great benefit to the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is completed, then submerge cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place on the wound a cerate or other thing containing oil, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption.
And then apply bandages at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered until you cut the hole with forceps and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And take every precaution not to tighten the wound with the fracture, for foolish doctors have often done this, and caused death or corrosive illness or suppuration, that is, pus, in their patients. And if your bandaging is light, soft, different from the bandaging of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear some bad complications which we have mentioned, and you find pain in the place, then you should not put splints on it, but make a wrapping of hard cloths instead of splints and tighten it with them.
And when, after a day or two, the wound begins to generate proud flesh, then you remove the cloth that you had placed on it with force, and then apply some ointments, with which we customarily treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you should untie the bandage and examine the wound every morning and evening until it is consolidated and closed, and the limb should be positioned in such a way that the pus drains from it to the lower parts easily.
If many days pass and the wound is not consolidated nor is the proud flesh cut away from it, then know that there are small sinuses present, therefore you should explore the wound with a probe. And of those sinuses, those that are separated [from healthy tissue], remove and extract [them]; those that are not separated and which put pressure on the limb and cause pain, you must necessarily incise them as much as possible.
And if there occurs in the wound ichor or sanies, that is, a foul discharge, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then you must treat each of these with what is appropriate for it, the treatment of which has been previously described in its chapter.
And regarding this, which should be the subject of my discourse, pay close attention: when a large bone is broken, such as the bones of the thigh and upper arm and similar large limbs, do not attempt to set it nor extract it because death often occurs from this;  leave it until it rots, for it will fall out very easily on its own after about 20 or 30 days; and then treat the wound if it seems appropriate to you, and if not, leave it.
Chapter 20.
On the treatment of the nodule that occurs in the trace/site of a fracture.
This nodule often occurs at the site of fracture healing, especially near the joints, and the shape of the limb is deformed by it; and it very quickly hinders the limb from its natural function.
Therefore, consider if the nodule is recent and administer astringent medicines such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, dragon's blood, acacia, and similar ones; thus, take some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and place it on the nodule with a cloth, and bind it tightly over it with a good bandage.
And leave this dressing on, not removing it for many days; and then remove it and apply another, until the nodule is reduced; or tighten a lead plate suitably on it, because lead has the property of reducing any swelling in the limbs.
But if the nodule has already hardened into stone and is tight and necessity compels its careful removal, then cut it at its highest point, and excise the excess and protruding part, or scrape it with a scalpel until it is reduced; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On the restoration of a fracture when it is healed and yet the limb remains thin and cold, not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is healed, and yet the limb remains thin and cold, this happens for many reasons: one of which is an excessive dissolving of the ligament and improper bandaging; or by excessive tightness of the bandages preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or by an excessive amount of superfluous embrocation (ointment/liniment); or by excessive movement at the wrong time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the treatment for this is to feed the patient and soften their heart until the blood is increased in them; and administer baths; and introduce joy and happiness to them.
And then place pitch on the limb, so that the pitch draws much nourishment to it, or continually apply embrocation with warm water, until nourishment flows and the limb returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of broken bones when they are healed crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
When a limb, already healed, exhibits crookedness and a protrusion or knot at the broken bone near its healed point, and there is therefore deformity of the limb's shape, but the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then it is not necessary for you to accept the advice of someone who recommends that the limb be re-broken.
But there have been many foolish doctors and bone-setters who have done this in our land; and this practice is very reprehensible, leading to great fear, the sign of which is death.  (Implying the fear can be so great it can cause death, or that the procedure is risky and can be fatal.)
But if the lameness and knot are recent, then they should be fomented with warm water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar ones; and a plaster should be made with a softening plaster like a well-made diachylon; or mucilage from marshmallow root can be taken and mixed with chicken fat or turpentine oil, and plastered with that; or ripe figs can be taken and ground with pigeon droppings, and similar medicines which are called consolidatives/strengtheners.
And sometimes it is dissolved with frequent light rubbing, done with moistened hands, and movement of the limb should be encouraged in all directions at all times.
But if the crookedness has already progressed and become hard and turned to bone, and the necessity for its treatment with iron (surgical instruments) is apparent, then the pus above must be drained and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and the excess knot along with the bone should be cut away with fine chisels/incision instruments, and care and attention should be applied to this with diligence and study.
Chapter 23.
Regarding/Concerning dislocation.
A dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, whereby movement is hindered, and the shape of the limb is distorted, causing great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to immediately ensure that it is reduced, and do not delay this reduction, because if it is delayed, the area will become abscessed and thus the reduction of the dislocation will quickly become difficult.
And for this reason it should not be moved or stretched during the time of abscess formation, because often this causes spasm and severe pain.
But when this occurs, then you must attend to the patient's phlebotomy (blood-letting), and then allow some time for the abscess to subside; and then the limb should be rubbed with warm water and oil, and then it can be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated with that which will be mentioned in its proper place. (i.e. the appropriate treatment will be described later in the text.)
And I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation according to what was previously done for fractures; from the uppermost part of the body down to the lowest part.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two mandibles are dislocated thus if not treated quickly; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are moved from their places by a slight movement, and are only slightly softened; or they are dislocated by a complete and total dislocation, to the point that they are softened at the part of the joint so that saliva runs from the patient and they cannot hold it or close their mouth, and their tongue is impeded in their speech.
But when the dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns to its place by itself with little intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, then it is necessary that reduction be administered gently, and not delayed at all.
And the assistant should hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the root of the mandibular dislocation inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands should be outside with which he levers; and he instructs the patient to relax their jaws and allow them to move in every direction; and the physician levers the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.
And if its reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer fomentation with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easier and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And then when they are returned and leveled, and the patient's mouth is closed and not loose, then place cloth compresses with a cerate [ointment/plaster] on them, made of wax and rose oil; and then bandage gently with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head rest between two pillows, so that it does not lean to the right or left side; and do not force them to chew anything; let their food be like broth, until when the pain is relieved and the jaws are healed, then they may chew what they want.
And this should be administered gently, and do not force the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, and speaking, until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of both jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and are not returned to their places, then often fevers and persistent hiccups occur, and the patient's belly is very easily purged, and they very easily vomit pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal; and often the one to whom this happens dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
On the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and the extremity of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated from the inner side due to its connection with the chest/ribs; and sometimes it is dislocated on the outer part, and this is evident to the touch/sensation.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. And then squeeze the area with your palm with strong pressure, for it will return (to place).
And then place a plaster and powders on it and bind/bandage it.
But the extremity of the one that follows the elbow and is joined with it, is not dislocated in any way; therefore it must be reduced and matched as we have said and as is appropriate for you.
And then place a plaster, and powders, and a bandage on it, and order the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And with this same treatment the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
On the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that a muscle is dislocated only in three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated at the part of the navel(?) downward.  (The word "titillic" is unclear and could be a misspelling or a specific anatomical term not easily translated.)
And the second is that it is dislocated at the upper part of the muscle, and this is done late/slowly(?); and it is not dislocated at the parts behind by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated at the parts in front because of the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and comes out at the lower parts below the navel(?), and especially in those whose flesh is thin, it is easily dislocated; but in those in whom there is much flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And it very easily happens to some men by a blow or a fall, that their muscle becomes infected with a hot abscess/infection, and it is thought because of this that it is dislocated.
Therefore, it is necessary that you examine this until you are absolutely certain about it, and then proceed with its treatment.
And its dislocation is recognized when it is in the lower parts below the navel(?); so that you can distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, for you find a clear difference between them; and you find in the head of the muscle a concavity and below the navel(?) under the touch of the head of the muscle something like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all directions.
If it is dislocated under the foot or above, then you will find a noticeable lump, and it is not hidden.
And this dislocation is easily reduced when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And its reduction is that the practitioner lifts the patient's hand upwards; and then places his thumbs under the patient's navel(?), and strongly lifts the joint upwards to its place, and the practitioner raises the patient's hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it down, for it returns easily.
But if it does not return by what we have said, and it is from the beginning that the dislocation happened, many days ago, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in hot water and an emollient and softening embrocation be administered, such as boiled roots of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and melilot in water, and let it be administered.
And then the patient should lie supine on their back and a ball of wool, which is balanced between softness and firmness, should be placed under their navel(?). And then the physician should place their heel on the ball, and forcefully lift the head of the muscle, and pull the patient's hand so that it is not moved downwards, and another assistant should hold the patient's head so that it is not moved downwards, for then it quickly returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this way: have a man present who is taller than the patient, and let him stand on the side of the affected area, and put his arm under the patient's navel(?) and lift it upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another practitioner pulls the patient's hand from below their abdomen. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with them to weigh them down, because the dislocation returns quickly.
And it is easily reduced in another way: a long stick is fixed in the ground, the top of which is round in shape, like a pestle, that is neither thick nor thin, and then it is placed under the patient; then linen cloths are placed over the top of the stick, and the patient stands lengthwise along the stick, and then their hand is extended downwards on the other side; and their body is extended forcefully on the other side, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if its reduction is difficult by all the methods we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a stick the length of which is two cubits, and its width is four fingers, and its thickness is eased at the tip for the navel(?) according to this form:
And then linen cloths should be tied over the rounded end so that the stick does not injure the patient.
And then it is placed under the patient's navel(?), and the hand or arm is extended over the stick downwards, and the stick is tied to the helper and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a stair rung horizontally, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is suspended on the other side, for the joint will return immediately.
And when its reduction is complete according to whatever manner is possible for you, then it is necessary to place under the navel(?) wool stuffing of equal quantity; and then place a plaster prepared from ground mill-dust with vinegar and egg white over the whole muscle, thus covering it over, and then tightly bind it under the navel(?) with a suitable bandage; and the binding is wrapped over the plaster, and their hand is tied to their neck, and left like that, and their hand may not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's food be kept meager, until the limb is strengthened, for it is thus easier for them to heal.
And then more food may be given after five or seven days and some movement undertaken; and so if it is firm and not soft, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to excess moisture or for another reason, then it is necessary in that case to administer the cautery with three burns, as was previously said in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the binding is loosened and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and the bandaging are reapplied several times, and it is not firm and so they cannot raise that arm upwards, then know that their nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are now incised or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Regarding the dislocation of that which is made below the feet and the breast or the back parts, the reduction is done by pushing and extending with the hands, until it returns (to its place).
And another bandaging should be applied to it, and treat it until it is healed.
And if heaviness occurs in the limb near the healing and slowness in its movement, then let the patient use baths many times until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original state.
Chapter 27.
On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it can be dislocated in all directions, but mostly forward or backward, and its dislocation is not hidden from you for it falls under sight or touch according to how it is dislocated, and when you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, this is clearly revealed to you, because the joint is concave and the patient cannot bend their arm, nor touch their shoulder with it.
And you must be diligent and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot swelling comes to it, because if a hot swelling comes to it, its reduction is difficult, and it is not easily healed completely; and especially when it is located towards the back, because it is worse than all the other types of dislocation, and more painful, and many times death follows from it.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's hand be extended with two hands, and their arm be spread out, and the physician's hands be above and below the elbow, and he should push the joint together with his thumbs, or with the heel of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is forward, then return it thus: bend the patient's hand with your hand, until you strike the elbow with the heel of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to the reduction, then apply vehement and very strong extension.
And two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should hold it firmly so that it is not moved during the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, after it has been wrapped with a long folded cloth, or bandage, over the hand.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that it may facilitate the lubrication of the joint; and then push the joint vehemently until it returns (to its place).
And after its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed on it, which has astringent and drying properties with egg white, and it be tightened with a downward binding, and the arm be suspended from the neck, and left (like that) for some days.
And then it should be untied; and then if the joint is set in its place, you untie its bandage and leave it.
And if you see that the joint is not well tightened, then you repeat the plaster and the bandage, and leave it for some days until it is tightened; and then untie it.
But if, after the reduction of the joint, heaviness occurs, and there is movement (instability) in it, then administer moistening with a bath and gentle rubbing, and compression, until it is relieved; or place emollients, that is, a fatty substance, on the joint; and then it should be bandaged, and left on the bones day and night. And afterwards remove it, and put him/her in a bath; and when he/she sweats, then rub the joint with a moderate friction, and afterwards repeat the application of the emollients, that is, pork lard, once, and a second time, and a third time. with baths in between, until it is softened/supple.
And if you wish, place on it a piece of moist cow dung warmed with butter and press upon it; and do this several times, for it is moist and restores it to its proper condition.
Chapter 28.
On the treatment of dislocation of the wrist, that is, of the joint that is between the arm and the hand.
The wrist is sometimes dislocated, and its reduction is easy, unlike other joints, but it is necessary that the reduction be performed quickly at the moment it is dislocated, before the area becomes swollen or develops a hot abscess.
And the reduction of the dislocation is done by placing the patient's wrist joint on a table and having an assistant extend his hand, while the physician places his hand or palm on the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns to its place.
But it must be considered whether the palm has been turned towards the belly of the hand.  In this case, the patient places the back of his hand on a table during the extension and reduction.  And if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be inwards on the table, so that the physician's hand falls upon that prominence of the joint.
And thus if it returns quickly, good; and if not, then bandage it with a softening plaster to reduce the swelling and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise it will not be tolerated nor will you be able to reduce it after several days have passed.
But even if the joint remains in its twisted state, and the patient feels no pain, except that the hand is weakened and cannot grip anything; then know that the nerves are broken or torn, and then there is no remedy except to cauterize it near the affected area, and this will soon improve matters.
Then when the sickness has returned, apply the plaster we have recommended, and let it be bound and tightened for five days; then it should be loosened and left off, and the hand exercised.
But if its movement is hindered and some heaviness occurs, then soothe it with warm water and friction a few times, until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in every direction.
And when any finger is dislocated towards the back of the hand or the palm, then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns (to its place).
And then support the tip of the finger, and suspend it towards the direction in which it was dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is properly aligned on that same day. (Meaning the second day).
And when night comes, bind it according to that description, and don't stop unbinding it during the day and exercising it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is healed/firm.
And do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand, and bind it on that side and perform your initial treatment with it until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other directions.
Chapter 30.
On the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation of the vertebrae of the back or neck occurs, and many vertebrae are moved from their places, then there is no cure in that case, for death awaits the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excrement is expelled involuntarily, and they cannot retain it; and often some of their limbs are paralyzed, either both legs, or both arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is moved from its place, for often it is moved and often the displacement of these occurs in all four directions.
Thus, when it is displaced towards the back, it is called a hump/gibbosity.
But the treatment for it is that you consider whether the hump occurred from a childhood ailment, for then there is no cure or complete healing.
But for that which comes from a fall, or a blow, or something similar, the Ancients have already described the methods of treatment in lengthy discourse, most of which is beneficial; but I have abbreviated it, a little of which excuses its excess, for the sake of conciseness in my intended exposition, with which I have explained and demonstrated this using different instruments from those with which I will show and elaborate on this.
And of these, only the one that occurs on the back is treated properly with what I have described.
And the patient should be laid face down on a level surface near a wall, with a soft covering placed underneath so that his feet are not hurt.
And then a straight pole should be placed, fixed in the ground at the end of the surface near his head, and another pole opposite his feet at the other end of the surface.
And an assistant should hold the pole, and it should not be fixed in a hole; and another assistant should hold the other pole in the same way.
And then wrap a strong linen bandage over the patient's head and under his armpits firmly; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole which is behind his head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage over his hips, his buttocks, and behind his legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other pole which is behind his feet.
And then each assistant should extend the bandage towards the end of the pole, and the two poles and the bandages should not be moved from their places where they are fixed, but they are not fixed as we have said.
And the physician should place his palms strongly upon the vertebra until it returns (to place), or he should place a board over it, and then place his feet upon the board until it returns (to place).
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board whose width or length is about three cubits, and dig a place in the wall (which we have mentioned is near the patient) into which the end of the board can enter. And then place half of the board over the vertebra, and the physician should place his feet on the other end, and press firmly until the vertebra is reduced and returns to its place.
And if you wish, use a windlass which is turned by hand; that is, you fix in the ground behind the patient's head two poles, the length of which should be one cubit, and likewise two poles behind his head [this seems repetitive, perhaps "feet"?]; and the distance between each pole should be a palm, and a hole should be made in each pole through which a rope runs, and each one should be firmly fixed in the ground so that it cannot be moved.
And let a round pole, on which the windlass is, be placed and turned in the two holes of the two poles.
And at its end there is a hole in which the pole is inserted, the length of which is a palm, along with the part that is turned; and in the other two poles there is a similar arrangement.
And then tighten the bandages that you have tied on the patient's feet in the hole which is behind his head, and the bandages that you have tied on his thighs in the hole which is behind his feet. [Or perhaps, "the windlass which is towards his feet."]
And then next to each windlass there should be an assistant who turns the windlass with his hand, and the physician straightens the spine as we have described.
And then after the vertebra is returned, and the place is straightened, then it is necessary that you apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then tow; and then place on the plaster a splint of wood whose width is three fingers or about that, and its length should be enough to cover the area of the hump, and over the part of the protruding vertebra.
And then it should be bound with the bandage that we have described, and the patient should use/have a light diet until he is healed.
And if any swelling remains in the place at the end of the healing, then it is necessary that softening and cleansing medicines be administered with the application of the board for a long time, which we have recounted; and then a sheet of lead is applied to that place.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the back of the dorsal vertebrae, and it is thought to be due to that dislocation; and it is that bone which is already prominent, so no attempt should be made to treat it with this medicine, for it will very easily cause death.
Chapter 31.
On the treatment of dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint suffer only dislocation, and they do not experience what happens to other joints, namely slight displacement and concavity/subluxation.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, or outwards, or forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards.
And a sign of its inward dislocation is that, when you compare the patient's healthy leg with the injured one, it is longer and the buttock is more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards the groin, and the place near the groin is swollen with a hot swelling, because the head of the femur has moved there.
And the sign of the one who has an outward dislocation is that their symptoms are opposite to this.
And a sign of the one who has a forward dislocation is that they can extend their leg fully, but they cannot bend it without pain in the buttock, and if they force themselves to walk, they cannot do so forwards; and their urine is retained and their groin is swollen, and next they walk on their heel.
And a sign of the one who has a backward dislocation is that they cannot extend the buttock, nor can they bend it forward without bending the groin, and their leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is soft, and the head of the femur is near that place.
But the reduction of the types of this dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and longstanding, that it is already fixed by having it near; you administer its reduction and it remains according to its disposition, then it is not completely curable; and then no presumption should be made in that case.
But in the one whose dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four types of dislocation, then you should strive to return the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, for it returns very easily and does not need other treatment.
But, if it does not return in this way, then you must prepare a strong assistant and extend their leg from the lower part, either with their hands or with a bandage which is tied on the leg above the buttock; and another assistant should extend their hand from above so that they place their hands under their armpits; and then tightly tie a linen bandage over the base of the thigh, and have another assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be either from the inside of the groin towards the fork (perineum/pubis), or from the back towards the back.
And let the extension of all these be at once, until the patient is lifted with their body off the ground and remains hanging.
And this type of extension is common to all four (types of dislocation).
And so if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then for each type it is necessary to describe the specific treatment.
In the reduction of the hip itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the patient be lying on their healthy side; then place the bandages on the root of the thigh in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the place that is below the groin; then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the highest part of the perineum/pubis.
And then another strong assistant should take his arms and grasp the thick part of the diseased thigh and extend outwards with strong extension, for it will return to its place.
And this type, with which this limb is reduced, is of easier treatment than the other types.
But if it is difficult for you and you cannot manage entry with this type of treatment at all, then it is necessary that the two feet of the patient be tied together with a strong, light bandage, above both ankles and both knees.
And the length of each of its parts should be the amount of four fingers, and let the diseased leg be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
And then the patient should be suspended over the top of the wood, and it should be in the house; and his distance from the ground should be the amount of two arms' lengths.
And then order a strong youth to pull down on the top of the thigh, and another youth should be suspended with the patient, and the other youth pulling down on the thigh with strength should push, for the joint will return to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when there is dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the patient lie on his back according to what we have recounted in the chapter on humpback; and the bandage should be tightened on the diseased leg specifically and upon his feet.
And then two pieces of wood should be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head; and then fitted pieces of wood should be placed in the middle of the mound placed on which damp cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed by the wood being between his thighs, so that he should not be pulled by the extension downwards.
And then each assistant should extend their part, and the physician with his hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the forward parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and this is according to the same description, upon a mound; and the physician places the palm of his right hand over the diseased groin, and then presses it with the other hand, and with this pressure pushes it downwards toward the painful area.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary for the patient to be lowered, and he is raised above the ground; he should be placed on a hard surface, just as the leveling is necessary if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about his lying on two hips; and he is on his face and the ligaments are extended, according to what we have said, not long ago.
And compression must be administered with a board over the place where the joint protrudes.
Then when the reduction is complete as it should be—and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, and that is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see them equal and the patient stretches his leg and spreads it without hesitation, then you know that the limb has returned as it should—and then you arrange two cushions and apply a plaster and bind it with a bandage so that the hip is not moved in any direction; and the patient should adhere to rest for three or four days.
And then untie the bandage and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then you know that the dislocation is already healed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause for softening (inflammation/swelling), then you return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding, and leave it for three days.
And then untie it, and have him delay walking on it for some days, until it is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, and inwards, and downwards, and more to the back; and it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that when you command the patient to bring his leg up to his thigh, then you know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration in all its forms is that you make the patient lie straight, so that he extends his leg, if he can; then you put your two hands on his face, and place his foot between your feet; and then make his knee adhere with your palms, and hold them with your fingers strongly upon his knee, and another assistant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that his leg will then adhere to the thigh with easy, unimpeded movement. (literally: with non-laborious lightness)
And then apply a plaster to it and make the leg adhere to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then untie them.
And the patient should not walk for some days, until he is healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction is difficult for you, then administer strong extension with the bindings, of which there was previous mention in the treatment of the hip.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle/heel. ( _talo_ likely refers to the talus bone, hence ankle or heel)
The ankle/heel is sometimes moved slightly, and sometimes it is completely dislocated, and its dislocation occurs either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the ankle/heel swollen, protruding to the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its slight movement is easy reduction, and it is that it be extended gently with the hands and adjusted until it returns (to its place).
But in its treatment when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright, and have a strong and capable assistant hold him from behind his back, in the middle of his back.
And then you take with your right hand the foot from the highest part/top, and with your left hand the lower part of the foot in the area of the ankle.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left twice, and then extend with your left; and push the toes of the foot with your right towards the leg without exertion/force.
And do this twice, as we have described.
And then push the toes of the foot towards the leg the third time, and you are at the ankle.
Then return (the foot) once or twice in this manner, and if you see the foot straightened, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, for it will return (to normal).
But if you are prevented from reducing it with what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly fix a very strong cloth to the ground, which should be placed between their thighs, and you have already wrapped cloth over them so that you do not hurt the patient.
And then have their assistant hold their thighs, and then have another assistant extend the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied above the ankle; and then let each assistant extend it against the other's pull, and let the cloth be stretched between the patient's thighs, holding it, so that their body is not pulled downwards during its extension.
And then the physician sets the dislocation with their hands, and another assistant holds the healthy thigh downwards, so that the dislocation returns easily.
And when the dislocation returns (to its proper place) and the success of its reduction is apparent to you, then apply a plaster and secure it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg.
And you should be wary of/take care with the tendons that are behind the heel, so that the bandaging on it is not too tight and does not injure it severely.
And then leave it like that for two or three days; and if the bandage loosens, tighten it.
And then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not become loose and disrupted again, and then it may not be curable.
And if a hot abscess develops, then you must administer to soothe it that which we have described previously, in another place, regarding treatment and embrocation, until it is removed/reduced.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
It is necessary that the dislocated toe be straightened with little extension without force; and this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
But if the dislocation is in some of the bones of the back of the foot, then you must have the patient place their foot on a level spot on the ground or on a table, and stand as if they were walking.
And then you stand near their foot and place your foot on the part beyond the affected joints, and press on it with your foot forcefully until it returns (to place), and you see that it is straightened and no protrusion appears at the location.
And then place a splint under the sole of their foot, covering the entire foot, which has two ends, and then tighten it with moderate and firm bandaging for three days; and then loosen it and let them rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and healing is assured.
Chapter 35.
Regarding the types of dislocation that are caused by a blow or by a fracture or by any of these together.
When you encounter any of these cases, and you exert yourself in its treatment and in the patient's recovery, death often occurs.
And therefore, no one should presume to treat it except someone who is wise in the art, with long experience, merciful and compassionate, cautious, not rash nor presumptuous; and who uses, in the beginning, medicines that only reduce hot swellings/inflammations, and leaves the patient to divine judgment, except for the one in whom you hope for salvation from destruction, with alleviation of the illness, and in which some hope appears. And then strive to immediately perform the reduction at the beginning of the event, before a hot swelling/inflammation develops.
And then if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that reduces hot swelling/inflammation and treats the wound with appropriate drying ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and you find separated bone fragments, then you must secure their union/setting, and do in this what we have said about simple maladies of this type that has been previously described in their places.
And watch out and avoid, according to your ability, entering into dangerous procedures as my preaching has forewarned you; for this is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and more salutary for your true purpose in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly, for which God be praised. Amen.
