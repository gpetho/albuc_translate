Of the obstruction of the penis
Sometimes children are born without a hole in the penis, or the hole is small, or it is not in the right place. So it is necessary to immediately pierce it with a very fine spatula in this form: then place a fine lead nail in the hole, and tie it and leave it for three or four days and when he wants to urinate, the nail is removed, and he urinates, and then it is replaced; and perhaps it is not needed because the urine that comes out will not let it close.
Those whose hole is small are treated with the lead nail, as we have said, and it will enlarge. Those who do not have the hole in the right place are injured, because some are born with the hole at the top of the penis, so they cannot urinate unless they lift their penis high; and they cannot impregnate because the semen cannot reach the womb, and this is a bad condition.
And the procedure is that the patient should lie often on his back, then stretch the tip of the penis and cut it like the shape of a pen, so that the hole is in the middle, as it should be; and be careful of bleeding which often occurs, and if it happens, stop it with what stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
