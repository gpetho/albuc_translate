When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with snuff, and squeeze her mouth and nose with your hands; and if it comes out that way, that is good.

and hold it until the vapor reaches the uterus; then make her sneeze, as we have said. The afterbirth will come out quickly.

and search for the afterbirth; and when she finds it, let her take it and gently stretch it straight, so that the uterus does not fall during extraction; but she must move it gently to the right and left, then pull; it will come and detach.	But if it be adherent to the depths of the uterus, then let her piss her hand in as we described until she find the afterbirth; then let her draw very slowly and gently lest by violent pulling she cause a prolapse; and she should slowly move it from side to side, left and right; then let her increase the traction, for then it gives way to the pull and is freed from its adhesions.	0.7749256

it will rot and detach, and come out; but always, when it rots, there will be a bad smell to the stomach and the head, and harm the patient.
