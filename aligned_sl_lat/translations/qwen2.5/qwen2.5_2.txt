After I had completed for you, my Sons, this book, which is the last in science of medicine with its complement, and after bringing to an end thereon according to his exposition and his declarations, it seemed good to me to complete it for you together with this Treatise which is a part of operations, that is, surgery with the hand.
Since the operation with the hand is foreign to our region and time, and has been completely abandoned perhaps until the science of it perished and its trace was cut off: and nothing remained from it except precise descriptions in ancient books, which have been altered by hands: and error and hesitation happened to them until their intentions were closed and the force of it was prolonged: It seemed good to me to revitalize it with the arrangement of this Treatise concerning it according to the position and declaration and abbreviation: and to provide permission with the forms of the surgeon's instruments, and other tools of the operation: which is done by adding to its declaration and hastening what is necessary.
The reason why a good artisan with his hand is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for the author thereof to exercise himself before that in the science of anatomy, as Galen narrates, until he knows the limbs' aids, their forms, their connections, and separations, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, sinews, their numbers, their exits, and of veins, their pulsating and quiet states, and the places from which they exit.
And for that reason, Hippocrates said, "A name without work is much, and with work is little, especially in the art of the hand.
We have indeed already spoken of that in the introduction to this book.
Since he who is not knowledgeable of what we have said concerning anatomy will not be benefited, but will rather fall into error, by which men are harmed: as I have seen many among those who are trained in this science and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
Because I have seen a stupid physician incise a scrofulous apstema on a woman's neck, and he accidentally cut certain arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she died in his hands.
And I have seen another physician who attempted to remove a stone from a man who had it at an advanced age, and the stone was large. Therefore he reached for it and extracted it along with a fragment of the bladder. Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And I myself had indeed been called to remove it and saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
And I have seen another physician who received a fee from one of our Duke's men for his medical services: and it happened that a black eunuch, who was with him, suffered a fracture in his thigh near the heel: and the physician, out of his ignorance, hurried and bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and strong pins, and did not allow the wound to heal.
Then he discharged him according to his desires. Then he discharged him after a few days, and commanded him not to release the bandage: and he stood thus until the apstema on his thigh and foot developed, and he came to destruction.
I was therefore called to him, and hastened to untie the ligament: and there ensued tranquility, and he escaped from his pains.
Truly, the corruption was now confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to wander through the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician who punctured the cancerous abscess: and it became ulcerated after a few days, until the wickedness of it increased with its lord.
Which is because when a cancer is pure from the black bile, then it is not necessary to puncture it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate its complete removal.
And for that reason, my son, you must know that the operation with the hand is divided into two parts: namely, the operation which is associated with safety; and the operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
And I have already excited in every place of this book where the operation comes which is accompanied by terror and fear.
Therefore, you must beware of this and dismiss it: so that the foolish do not find a way to speak about it and dishonor it.
Therefore, receive the measure with solicitude and protection, and your infirm ones with ease and firmness, and make use of the better way conducted by the grace of God for salvation and a commendable succession: and dismiss terrible diseases that are difficult to cure: and lift your souls from what makes you fear, so that hesitation enters upon you neither in your faith nor in your well-being.
For it remains more to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your measures.
Galenus has already said this in some of his admonitions. Do not treat evil diseases: nor be called doctors of evil.
Now we divide this Treatise into three Chapters.
Chapter First.
On the cautery with fire, and the cautery with sharp medicine, divided and ordered from head to feet, and forms of instruments and tools of the cautery: and everything necessary for the operation.
Chapter Second.
On incision and puncture, phlebotomy and venesection, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows and similar objects: and the entire chapter ordered by the forms of instruments.
Chapter Third.
On restoration, dislocation, and the cure of torsions, and similar cases: the chapter ordered from head to feet, and by the forms of instruments.
But Firstly Before I recall the operation with him, I must say of the quality of his horses, and of its hurts: and in what complexion it is exhibited.
I say that the discourse concerning the quality of Cauterius's horse and its hurts is a lengthy and subtle science, a hidden and secret art.
And many wise men spoke on this matter and disagreed with one another. And to me, their words suffice only a little, fearing the lengthening of the discourse.
I say that Cauterius's horse is effective universally for all complexions, whether with matter or without matter, except for two complexions: the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
However, they disagreed concerning the hot and dry complexion with matter. For some said that Cauterius's horse is beneficial in the hot and dry complexion with matter. And others said the opposite, namely that Cauterius's horse is not appropriate in disease caused by heat and dryness, for the nature of fire is heat, and it would be inappropriate to heal with something hot and dry when the condition is already hot and dry.
And he who says the opposite said that through Cauterius's horse, benefit is derived in every hot and dry disease that occurs in human bodies: for when you compare the human body and its humors to the fire complexion, you find the human body to be cold.
And I indeed say by his word: because from experience he has shown me that it is so oftentimes.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diversitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in seipsis, et causas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacio temporis earum.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis. Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.
And know ye, my sons, that from the secret of cure through cautery with fire, and the goodness thereof surpasses medicament burning: for fire is simple, its action reaching only to the part cauterized, and it harms no other connected part, save with a very small harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.
Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not cause it unless there is excess.
Indeed, we have learned this through experience, because of the length of our servitude and study with the art, and our position above the truth of things: and for this reason, the explainer is excused from the length of speech.
And if I did not refrain, because it is not fitting for my book, I would tell you of a secret operation in fire, and the quality of its action in expelling from the bodies ailments, which would be demonstrated philosophically to sharpen your minds.
And you know, children, that they disagree on the time when it is fitting to make a cautery and prefer the true time.
And I say that a cautery is fitting at all times: for the harm that occurs due to time is overcome by the help that is drawn with the cautery. And especially if the cautery is due to pains from necessary, strong, acute pains that do not tolerate delay: for fear that something worse may occur than a minor harm due to delay.
And let it not enter your minds, my children, that this is not true, unless by the common people and dull doctors, who say that an ailment cured by cautery does not always return. And they put forth a consequence from this, and the matter is not as they think: for cautery is not used except in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries up the humors which are the causes of pain.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor. Sed illud fit in paucis.
At uero sermo vulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.
Res autem est contrariwise illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinem, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt vulgus et multitudinis medicorum.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii. Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probavi illud, et inveni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt. Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam vis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et vertitur in laminas.
Wherefore the artisan falls back to the use of iron, and on that account the cautery is made with iron among us more quickly and conveniently, for the sake of proper operation.
And I have indeed arranged this Chapter on the Cautery according to headings, and have ordered it from head to foot, so that he who seeks may find what he wishes.
Head II.
This cauterization is applied to the dominion of moisture and cold over the brain: these two are causes of soreness, and an abundance of fluid flow from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and an abundance of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain: and universally all diseases that occur from cold, such as paralysis, soreness, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the patient to use medicamentuous sweat induced by fomentation for three nights or four, according as the strength of the patient, and his age, and his custom require.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor. Then make him sit between your hands in a square manner, so that he has placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Then wherever your middle finger overcomes, mark that place with the unburned skin.
Then cauterize with fire: this is its form.
Then place it over the marked place with the unburned skin, using a descent by which you may gradually constrain your hand, and you shall revolve it. Then lift your hand quickly, and examine the place.
If you see the quantity of the head of alkali or the quantity of zevherb already exposed from the bone, then lift your hand. And if not, repeat the operation with the iron itself, or with another that has been cooled until the bones, which I have told you about, are revealed.
Then take something from the salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cloth in it, and place it over the place: and let it remain there for three days.
Then place the soaked cloth in butter on top, and let it remain over the place until the burn eschar is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacum ointment until it is healed.
They have said that the more the wound remains open, the more pus it emits; therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said, let the skin be cauterized down to the bone: and hold the Cauterium until something of thickness of bone is burned.
Then the flesh is shaved after that which is burned is removed from the bone, and then it is treated.
And others say that it must be achieved with the cauterium to the very end until it impresses upon the bone a mark like that of a kirate: or an instrument which women place infuso alphabeti parui. They believe that vapors from the head are exhaling from this place and that the open wound will heal over a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals.
To me, however, these two species of cauterium do not seem to differ at all except in some people according to the way of fear.
And letting it heal on its own, in my opinion, is better with the health of the individual.
For the head weakens from the disruption of its natural continuity: as we have witnessed in other parts of the body. And especially when the head is naturally weak and feeble. Indeed, the first species of cauterium is more safe and better with me, and I use it. Therefore, I operate with it for the sake of health.
Head III.
When there is chronic pain throughout the head, and this persists in the patient, who uses hydries, cochineals, head purges, oils, and plasters. And especially if it has already been cauterized with the cautery we have described, and nothing from those is applied to it: then consider. For if the head of a sick person is of strong natural constitution and is not weak, and he finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery under the first lightly. Then cauterize it above all the horns of the head with the cautery, nor let the skin pass through, and cover the quantity from the bone as we have described. And cauterize it with one cautery at the back of his head, at a place called vas: and this is the place where the suction cup is placed: and raise his mature blister here, and do not uncover the bone. For the sick person finds intense pain at that place, different from the pain caused by other cauterizations of the head.
And I will call this cauterization at its place: and it must be a cauterization with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head with a finer cautery, with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Head IV.
When pain occurs in part of the head with soda, or extends to the eye, and is evacuated with cleansing medicines for the head, and the remaining treatment, as I said in divisions of diseases, is not effective: then cauterization in this should be done according to two methods: either with burning sharp medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus. Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitte puluinus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum. Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.
Et nominatur Clavialis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in qua est quoddam curavitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius. And raise your hand, so that the artery below is not burned, and blood flow occurs.
Then soak the wound in salt water, and place it over the area, and leave it for three days: then apply the wound with butter: later care with ointment until it is cured.
And if you wish, cauterize this headache with the extremity of the second Cauterium knife. And be careful with the incision of the artery in this headache, not an old one.
¶ Concerning the cauterization for old headaches.
When you treat a headache, proceed as we have said in the previous cure and as we have said in the divisions of diseases. And if the treatment does not suffice: and you see from the disease that what we said about the first cauterization with medicine, or with fire-cauterization, is insufficient for him, then it is necessary to burn the Cauterium knife until it whitens after you mark the place of pain with a line whose length is the middle of a finger, or as close as that. And withdraw your hand once, and press it until you incise the artery and reach the opening.
Indeed, you must be careful to avoid the continuity of the jawbone, which moves during chewing, so that the side or the nerve that moves it is not burned, lest a spasm occur.
And be mindful of the care and precaution concerning the flow of blood from the artery that has been severed. In amputation there is fear, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing and is neither studious nor experienced: and he relinquishes the operation at first.
And I allow it with the reminder of the regulation of the flow of blood resulting from the artery according to its own mode, and in the place where this book.
If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the sick body bearing the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, care for the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives. For this cautery is better and more effective.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for pain in the ear.
When pain in the ear occurs from cold, and is treated with solui (astringents), and the remaining treatment as we have said in division, and the pain does not go away, then use cautery with fire: and it is that which is called Punctum, whose form is this.
Then make the puncta around the entire circumference of the ear as it is revolved, or around both sides if the pain is in both ears. And move the cautery from the root of the ear slightly after marking the places with encaustic: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten puncta in each ear, and almost like that.
Then care for the place until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing in Torture.
Head VII.
Torture which is treated with cauterization is not anything other than cases that arise from phlegmatic conditions, as we have said in our discussions on diseases.
And the proper cauterization for the species that arise from drying out and nerve spasms.
When you treat this species of torture with wines, and head purges, and gargles, and if the treatment does not bring about healing, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient three times with Cauterizations: once at the root of the ear, and a second time slightly below its proper place, and a third time at the conjunction of the two lips.
And apply your cauterization to the opposite side of the sick area. For softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of the cauterization is to cauterize that part directly at the bottom of the upper ear near the corner of the head: and at another time, whose length shall be according to the length of the thumb. And remove your hand with the cauterization until it burns through to a thickness halfway through the skin.
And this is the form of the cauterization. It is a species from the surgical knife, the form of which was previously given; however, it should not be too thin, as you can see: and the blade should be slightly thicker than necessary.
Then care for the place, together with what has preceded: until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in ancient apoplexy.
When ancient apoplexy occurs, and you have cared for it with what we have said, and the treatment you have applied is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him four times over each horn of his head, and once in the middle of his head, as we have said, and once at the back of his head, according to what has preceded: and the manner of cauterization shall be according to what has preceded.
And it is also cauterized with a cautery over the mouth of the stomach: and this is more final.
Then care for it, together with what has preceded.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary to give the patient great hyssop and brain cleansing pills first in his drink.
Then shave the entire head of the patient, and apply the plaster described in the chapter on plasters at the back of his head, and apply it several times.
This is the manner of cauterization: and do it according to the same order as I said before.
If therefore he is healed by that, it is good. If not, then cauterize him three times at the back part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye, and place between each cauterization the thickness of a finger.
Then care for the cautery, following what has preceded.
If, however, you wish to add and the patient is able to tolerate that: then perform the cautery in the middle. If you wish to add, then cauterize it over both horns.
Then care for it until it is healed: and the cautery should be oiled in accordance with the form mentioned.
On the manner of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Chapter X.
You should proceed with the purification of the head using hyssop and what we have said before.
Then shave the patient's head: afterwards, cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over each horn of the head, and three times at the back of the neck.
If you need to cauterize for the softening of the illness in many places in the body, and the patient is able to tolerate it, and the illness is strong: then cauterize it four times over the vertebrae of the back, and the last with a single cautery, until the skin burns as much as possible from it, and raise your hand. Then care for it until it is healed: and thus oil the cautery.
On the manner of cauterizing in epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized, except for one who has epilepsy from phlegm.
Therefore it is necessary that the brain of the patient be cleansed first with vinegar, and with the other treatment as we said in the division: when the sick person is great, or tolerates the reception of medicines.
If, however, it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then gargling and chewing substances that cleanse the brain are administered, before all that for many days with the improvement of food.
Then shave his head, thereafter cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has preceded in the manner: and with another cautery at the back of his head, and over all the horns of his head. If the sick person is strong and tolerates it, then cauterize it with the cautery which I said in one having paralysis, and soften the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be oiled according to the manner which has preceded.
If, however, the sick person is a child, then place a fine cautery according to this manner.
On the method of cauterizing in Melancholia.
When the cause of melancholia is corrupt humours and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries which we said in one having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is excess declivity into melancholia, and the body of the sick person is moist, then give him in drink what cleanses his brain, according to what has preceded in the division: then shave the head of the sick person, and make a tortilla properly made from linen, like a ring.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and let the sick person sitting have the square part held from every side.
Then present the ointment. And it is better with old camel butter. And heat it over a fire with tempered heat to a temperature that the finger can tolerate when introduced into it. Then evacuate it in the middle of his head in a circle, and let it remain until it cools down.
Do this to the sick person once every week, with the rest of the treatment being good, until he is cured.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making small punctures in it, and let your hand hold the cautery: it should be scented.
For this type of cauterization moistens the brain with its quality.
Then place over it a cloth soaked in camel butter, or in chicken fat.
¶ Regarding the method of cauterizing when water descends to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of the water in the eye is made clear to you by the signs I mentioned in the division, then begin and treat the sick person, using what will cleanse his head.
And keep him from all humidity, and make him sit in a bath for several days of fasting.
Then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his head. Then cauterize it over two temporal regions with two cauterizations, if there is the onset of the descent of water into both eyes simultaneously: or from one side, if there is the onset of water in one eye: and cut away with the cauterization all veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cauterizations be long in width over the temporal regions: and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see anything from this, then cut it out immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will employ the wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting away of them, and caution against the flow of blood.
And when it is cauterized in the neck, under two bones, with two cauterizations brought to the end.
¶ Regarding the method of cauterizing for ancient tears.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient and frequent, and are over the veins and arteries that are manifest on the exterior of the head, it is verified that this is from excess cold and phlegmatic humors: then cauterize with the same cauterization that I described for the onset of descending water, in the middle of the head, and with two cauterizations over the temporal regions, and with two cauterizations in the neck under the two bones. And if you find it necessary to add, then cauterize it on the entire side of the eye, over the eyebrow tip with a small cauterization.
¶ Regarding the method of cauterizing for nasal fetor.
When you treat it according to what we said in the division, and if the medication does not respond: then hasten, and give the patient infirmocochias three nights in drink: then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cauterization, using olive oil. Then cauterize it with a cauterization of clauili two times, above the eyebrows near the hair.
And guard against the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the form of the cauterization Clauilis.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing for the softening of the Eyelid.
When the Eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or humidity: then cauterize the Eyelid with one cauterization, using this lunar cauterization.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows with two cauterizations in all parts: and let them be distant from two temporal regions: and the length of every cauterization should be according to the lengths of the eyebrows: and do not end your hand with the cauterization at the very ends, but rather according to the quantity that is burned on the third eyelid.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing the Eyelid when hairs grow inward and prick the eye.
Cauterization in this is according to two modes: either cauterization with fire: or cauterization with burning medicine.
In cauterization with fire, instruct the patient beforehand, so that he sheds his hair, if he has such hair that cleanses them, until they grow out and become equal in length. If, however, he is pricked at his root: then bind his eyes with cloths, so that they do not move, until they grow.
When therefore they grow and become equal, then place the patient's head in your lap: then mark over the eyelids of his eyes with encaustic, a mark shaped like the figure of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hair.
Then apply a cloth soaked in egg white: or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Then apply cauterization with fire, whose form is this.
Then cauterize according to the shape you marked, gradually in successive stages, until the skin surface burns and appears as the entire shape of a myrtle leaf.
And the sign of your work's success is: that if you observe the eyelid of the eye beginning to contract, and hair rising at the site of the eye puncture.
Lift your hand then: and release him for three days.
Then place a cloth with butter over him until the eschar is eradicated. Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
If any of the hairs return after an hour and the eyelid becomes softened: then apply the cautery to that place again, as you did at first.
If the hairs are on the lower part: then apply the cautery to it until it rises to its natural place, and make sure the hairs do not irritate the eye.
You should instruct the patient to allow the hairs to grow until they extend and become equal. Make the shape of a myrtle leaf from paper on cloth.
Then take from known soap and unabsorbed ash, one ounce from each: then grind these together with good mixing, and do this with haste so that it does not cool. Then spread it on the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid(s) of the eye(s). And place under the eye a cloth soaked in egg white: and the patient's head be in your care.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently. And you should move it whenever the patient feels the medicine biting, for its bite is like fire.
While the patient continues to feel the bite of the medicine, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger. When therefore the bite is quiet, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid rise, as it rises upon contraction with fire, or with incision, it is well: and if not, then iterate over the same with medicine upon the place, where the medicine does not impinge, and does not darken, until your operation is equated, and the eye is contracted.
Then place upon it Cotum with butter, until the burned skin is eradicated. Then care for it with diaphnicon ointment or another until it is healed.
And you must keep the last precaution during the operation, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
And if the eyelid softens after days and something from the hair fights in the eye, then iterate the medicine upon that place which softens from the eyelid, as you did at first. Then care for it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men vary in size and proportion. Therefore your consideration should be according to that: and the way of the straight path is not hidden from him who has a study in this art.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing in Lacrimal Fistula.
When you treat an abscess, following what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not succeed: then, it is necessary to cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and hold his head with a servant between your hands in such a way that it is not moved nor shaken with his head.
Then place a compress soaked in white honey or mucilaginous psyllium on his eye. Then apply a cauterizing tool, the form of which is as follows.
Let it be concave, as the shape of an arrow-shaped bird's wing from one end, with which the cauterizing tool is made. If you want it to penetrate to the other end and if you want it to go upwards, try accordingly.
However, this concave shape is better suited for your purpose.
Then express the abscess if it is open, and extract the pus from it and dry it out. If it is not open, then incise it and extract its pus.
Then place the cauterizing tool on it, which should be strongly ignited.
And hold your hand slightly beside the cauterizing tool near the eye, at the nose, so that your hand does not err or the patient be unsettled. Then place the cauterizing tool on the eyelid fat and destroy it.
If you thus reach the beginning of the cauterization at the mouth, it will be well. And if not, then repeat the cauterization one or two times, as you may need. Then let it be for three days.
Then apply cotum with butter, and treat it with an excisive ointment until it is healed.
And if forty days pass and it is not healed: then apply to it a sharp corrosive medicine until the wound opens; and scrape it according to what comes in the following chapter.
And there is another measure of cautery for fistula, which some of the foremost have said. Direct to the place of the fistula, and cut it open: then insert into the fissure a fine catheter, that is, a细长的管子，其形状如下所示。 And pour in it a quantity of a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with a good catheter for retention, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run and reach his eye.
And you should apply to the patient's eye a cotum infused in egg white or water.
For the lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it with a marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with the cautery and the treatment we have said, it is good. And if it is not healed, then it is necessary to make an opening in the nose and restore the fistula to its proper course, as it comes to its natural place.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in fissures of the Lips.
Frequently, in the lip, fissures called Pili occur, and especially in children's lips.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, following the division of illnesses as we have said, and if the treatment does not take effect, then prepare a small cautery with fire in this manner.
And let its depth be according to the fineness of the knife.
Then apply the heated instrument quickly to the fissures, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then treat it with calamine until it heals.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing in oral fistulas.
When an apostema occurs at the root of the tooth, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: it then produces pus and breaks open. Afterwards, it heals over, but the pus flows again, forming a fistula. Then treat the fistula itself, and if the treatment does not take effect, you should cauterize with fire according to the size that is taken in by the fistula. Then insert the heated instrument into the fistula opening, and hold your hand there until the heated iron reaches the depth and the end of it. Do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards, following what we have said regarding treatment until it heals.
If therefore the pus is removed and it heals, that will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove the corrupt opening according to what comes to its head.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in the gums and softened teeth.
When the gums are softened due to humidity, and the teeth are moved, and no relief is obtained with medicines: then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then cauterize with a burning cautery, the form of which will come after this: so place a Cannula over the tooth, and insert a burning cautery quickly into it. Hold your hand slightly until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand: then iterate with the cautery several times, according to your desire.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: then spit it out.
For the tooth, when moved, becomes firm, and the softened gums are tightened and the corrupted humidity is dried up.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing for tooth pain.
When tooth pain is due to cold, either the cold itself is present, or a worm, and no relief is obtained with medicines: then cauterize at that place according to two methods: either with a cauterization using butter, or with a cauterization using fire.
But when it is with butter, take butter of a cow, and boil it in a iron cup, or in an earthen one. Then take wool and wrap it around the end of the tendon. Then submerge it in boiled butter and place it over the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools. Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool or woolen cloth in cold butter, and place it over the painful tooth. Then place a heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
But when cauterization is with fire, direct your attention to an air canal or a iron canal. And let there be something of great thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's mouth.
Then apply the cautery with hot coals: place it over the tooth. Hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be relieved either on the same day or the next day.
And the patient should fill his mouth with good butter at the place of the cautery and hold it for one hour, then spit out the butter.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with whatever extremity you wish according to what is possible: and this is the form of the Cannula.
On the manner of cauterizing in Strophuli.
When Strophuli are caused by phlegm and cold humidities, and are not obedient to digestion through medicines, and one wishes to quickly bring about the digestion of them: then a concave Cauterium of fire, whose form is this.
It has two open ends, so that smoke may exit at the other end of the cauterium: and place the ignited one over the lesion once, and a second time if needed until it reaches the depth of the lesion.
If the lesion is small, then place the cauterium according to the size of the lesion.
Then remove it for three days, and place it over the lesion a solution soaked in butter until what was burned by the fire is removed.
Then care for it with tooth膏霜 until the form of the cannula is healed.
On the manner of cauterizing in raucedine vocis, and constriction of inhalation.
When humidities overcome the pulmonary canal, and especially when this is accompanied by coldness of the complexion, then it is necessary to evacuate the patient first with sudorific medicines.
Then cauterize it on the nocastrum at the root of the throat in a depressed place: and beware, lest with the cauterium you reach the throat or the skin, unless some part thereof.
Then cauterize the same cauterization at another place at the junction of the neck at the last vertebrae: and let the cauterization be with aawl according to the manner which preceded.
Then care for it together with what preceded until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in diseases of the lung and cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors, and the patient does not have fever, nor tuberculosis, and the condition is old: then cauterize it with two cauterizations above the furcula at depressed, gentle, and hollow places. And cauterize with another at the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cauterization be with a needle according to the form which preceded.
And if you wish your cauterization to be by piercing with a cauterization called Punctum, whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the points be from thirty punctures almost to another place.
Then care for it together with what preceded until it is healed.
And let the cauterization have three branches: according to this form. Wherefore the cauterization should be applied when you do three cauterizations in one place.
Head XXVII.
When the head of the auxiliary is dislocated due to humidity, and it does not return to its position within an hour after the dislocation, until that is its accustomed return, then it is dislocated by a slight movement, which happens as we have already testified to this, then you should reduce the dislocation at first. Then the patient is turned supine on his back, or on the healthy side. Then lift the skin which is on the inner side of the titulus towards the superior part with your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated towards the inner side.
Then hold the cautery with two needles. Its form is as follows.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the opposite side, and let the cauterization figure be made with four cauteries.
And sometimes a cauterization is done with a cautery having three needles, in which case the cauterization figure then uses six cauteries: and the needles are according to the subtlety of the probe.
And this is the form of the cautery having three needles.
And sometimes one is added to this, which is why there are eight cauteries.
Then place on the cautery finely pounded powders with salt. Then ensure the patient is in a tranquil position so that the limb does not move for some time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is towards the superior part, and this happens rarely, then cauterize it over the shoulder with a key-shaped cautery or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and the humidity is removed: and the sick person is cured.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Stomach.
When cold and many humors occur in the Stomach until it is removed from its complexion and catarrhs multiply to it, and frequent modes of cure are not applied: then it is necessary to have the sick person lie on his back, and extend his legs, and his arms. Then cauterize with three cautery irons: use one iron the size of a digit below the scapula with a key-shaped iron, and two lower ones from both sides by the amount of one cautery iron, until the figure of the more acute triangle comes. And lengthen between the two so that they do not join when pus forms.
And let the depth of the cautery be the thickness of two-thirds of the skin.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this form without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery that makes this one be according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it with a cautery that terrifies from this cautery: and let it be such that you mark a point on the stomach according to the quantity you wish with encaustic: then cauterize it with a puncture cautery: then cure it with the cure that preceded until it is cured.
On the manner of cauterizing the epistaxis with a cold instrument.
When a pain occurs in the head from coldness and humidity, or from windy humors until it has passed from its natural complexion through proper discharge, and the sick person is not cured as we said: then the sick person should be reversed on his neck, and three cauteries with an encaustic should be applied according to this figure and this quantity beneath the epistaxis, at the place where the cubit of a man reaches: and there should be space between each cautery according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight: and do not press your hand with the cautery much.
And let the quantity be such that it is burned according to the thickness of the skin, half its quantity not added: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
If he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
This is the form of the cautery.
And it is possible for you to apply these cauteries with a surgical cautery when you have subtlety and prudence in your art.
And beware that you do not proceed last in the cauterization, and the thickness of the skin is burned entirely, which would cause the body to be burned entirely and lead to the intestines. For the skin there is thin, so be aware of this.
On the manner of cauterizing apstema of the head.
When suppuration occurs and you wish to know whether that abscess is in the flesh of the epaulet or in its covering: then if it is in the flesh of the epaulet, there will be a pain and heaviness without acuteness; and if it is in its covering, with pain there will be great sharpness: and you see now that it has wearied his physicians with its cure.
Therefore, the patient must lie on his back on his neck. Then mark the place of the abscess with a cauterization: then use the cautery which resembles a ray. And this is its form. And cauterize with one cautery until the entire skin burns and reaches the sipha, until all pus emerges: then treat it with the cure for suppurations until it heals.
And it is not proper to use this cautery technique except for those whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and whose hands have often encountered such illnesses: then only may he dare perform such an operation.
But rather to dismiss it, it is better with me.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing in Pleurisy.
The ancients said that the cautery with roots of aristolochia should be used for cold pleurisy in this manner. And take from the dry roots of long aristolochia, one longer root, which is found there and is about the thickness of a finger. Then immerse it in oil and ignite it in fire. Then cauterize with one cautery in the area between the fork and the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly inclined downward towards the part beneath the beard.
And cauterize with two cauteries also in the area between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined towards the back: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And cauterize with three cauteries from the back: one in the area between the two spatulas, and two from the sides of the chest, with the lower cautery between the two spatulas.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, rather it should be evident by the smell on the skin.
And some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a rod: they ignite it and insert it internally between the ribs until they reach the apostema, and the pus emerges: as we have said in the case of the apostema of Epatis.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the sick person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs at the site, which does not have a cure.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen. Head 32.
When you treat an ailment of the spleen, according to what we have said from the treatment in the division of ailments, and if your treatment is not effective, then cautery should be applied in three ways, all of which are correct.
One of them is to make three or four cauterizations by marking according to the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauterization of the hips, whose figure precedes.
And let the quantity for all cauterizations be the thickness of a finger, or slightly more or less.
And let the measure of the cauterization be what we said regarding the cauterization of the hips equally.
And do not press your hand with the cauterization: let the patient lie supine on his back.
And another measure for the cauterization is this: ignite the cauterium with two irons, as we said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus. Raise the skin which is in direct line with the spleen, where the left arm of the patient reaches. Let your elevation be such that you raise the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall according to the length of the body.
Then insert two hot irons deeply until you penetrate the skin from the opposite side: then withdraw the cauterization. Thus four cauterizations are made.
And if you wish to cauterize with a cauterization holding three irons.
Then care for the cauterization after you release it, allowing it to discharge pus over many days. For it is more efficacious than the rest that preceded it in the cure.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in Hydrocele.
The cauterization does not apply to Hydrocele unless properly ascali.
When you treat Hydropicus with the methods of cure which we have said in division, and if the cure does not bring about a result, then it is necessary to cauterize it four times around the umbilicus, and with one cauterization over the stomach, and another over the flank, and one over the spleen, and two on the back between the vertebrae, and one directly over the breastbone, and another directly over the stomach: and let the depth of the cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then open the cauterization, so that pus may be discharged over a long period.
And do not discharge the patient from the cure after cauterization: for it is necessary that two intentions be present. And with the help of God, recovery will hasten upon him.
The form of the cauterization with which the abdomen is cauterized should be clavilis, according to the form that has preceded it: and that with which the back is cauterized, should be olivary, according to the form that has preceded it.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Feet and Legs.
When blisters form in Hydropicus and are filled with yellowish water, you must cauterize over the dorsum of the foot at nocratio, which is between the tarsal and annular bones. Raise your hand with the cauterization, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not repeat this procedure entirely.
For the yellowish water will exude, and the cauterization should be in this form.
Then make two cauteries over both legs, and let the cautery be made with the extremity of the surgical cautery: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower at about the middle of the leg: and upon every thigh two cauteries: and let the cautery remain open without cure for a long time: that some water may exude from it: then care for it with the rest as we have said.
On the Method of Cauterizing in the Treatment of Ventral Wounds.
Chapter XXXV.
When the ventral wound is from cold and humidity, until it weakens the retaining and digestive virtues which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is treated with methods of treatment, and does not heal: and you see the sick person tolerating a cautery of exuberant virtue, then cauterize it with a great cautery over its own stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four thin cauteries around the umbilicus, with a thin clavate cautery: and a great cautery above the alcatin over the others, or with two cauteries.
And if you see exuberant humors, and the sick person tolerating that, then cauterize it with a cautery over the pecten, and a cautery over all of it: and perhaps add two small cauteries over the stomach near the great one.
For the treatment is effective whose assistance does not fail.
On the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus there are old hemorrhoids, many or one, and they are from thick, cold, or corrupted humidities, and are treated with what we said in division, and not effective in treatment: then cauterize three times over the lower spine beneath the almeidati somewhat triangularly, and with a cauteri beneath the navel as if by two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is cooled down and his food is not digested, and you see his face boil, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cauteri according to what has preceded: and over the Epar, and another over the Spleen with a clavil cauteri: and let the open cauterium be for some time: then care for it until it is healed.
Head XXXVII.
When you excise the alt-helu, then ignite the cauterium that resembles a rod. Then insert the ignited cauterium into the excised alt-helu: and with your last hand, do this once or twice until the cauterium reaches the vein from which the blood flows.
If therefore the alt-helu are many, then cauterize each one with a cauterium according to what we have narrated. Then care for them, using what we have prescribed from ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize him with a large cauterium over the alcatin, it is more effective in aiding recovery.
On the manner of cauterizing a Fistula in anus.
Head 38.
When the patient does not respond to the operation and the procedure as described in its proper place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he is cured with cauterization.
When therefore a Fistula occurs and becomes old, pus flows from it, and corrupt humors appear. Therefore, what is more important is that you probe it thoroughly with a fine instrument. Then determine its depth by probing.
Then prepare the cauterizing iron, which is similar to a rod. Then insert the heated iron into the fistula and mark the depth at which it has entered.
And repeat the cauterization over it until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, twice, or thrice, according to the necessity of your case.
And beware of burning the nerves if there are any there, or large veins: or if the fistula goes to the bladder or to the intestinal wall, then beware of these areas in particular.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and consider, because it does not penetrate deeply.
Then take care that the area continues to heal until it is fully cured.
If however the area heals over and materials are removed from it, and remains thus for a long time, then know that it is now completely cured.
And if the matters do not separate from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that its mouth is deep within, or as something akin to those; and their mention will come to its place.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing the Kidneys.
When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or windy swelling, and is diminished because of the patient's fever, then it must be cauterized over almond oil over the kidneys, with a cauterization over each kidney using a clavil cautery, of which the mention has preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time with the same almond oil. Why three lines come. Therefore, they will be more effective in healing.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing the Bladder.
When debility and softening due to cold and humidity occur in the bladder, until the patient no longer retains urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the abdomen over the bladder, where the hairs begin like a brush, using the right side of the hand for one cauterization and the left side for another: and let the length of this cauterization be according to the width of a thumb. Cauterize it also with a cauterization on the lower back, or with two cauterizations if needed: and let it be according to what preceded the clavil cauterization.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing the Uterus.
When cold and humidity arise in the matrix and are prevented from impregnation, and the menses are corrupted, and the coming of them is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their approach, then it must be cauterized with three cauterizations around the umbilicus, as we said in cauterizing the bladder, and one cauterization above the alcatim on the lower back, or with two cauterizations: let the cauterization be of steel.
On the Method of Cauterizing the Ankh in Dislocation.
When the mucous humidities effuse to the back of the ankh, and become a cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of that is, that the leg is prolonged over the other when compared side by side: and the location of the dislocation is found to be vacuous.
Therefore, you must cauterize the patient over the back of the ankh with a similar circular cauterization: after you mark it with encaustic around the back, as it is turned: and let the skin fall into the middle of the circle.
And if this cauterization is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, using a large olive oil cauterization: and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the skin in total.
Then care for it until it is healed.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Sciatica.
When pain occurs in the buttock, and the cause of this is cold and humidities: and the patient is treated as we said in division, and no cure is effected, and that condition ages: then it must be that you purge the patient of gross humors with fetid pills or with artificial pills and similar. Then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is, that you cauterize over the buttock in question with three triangular cauterizations, according to this form. And make them of good or bad depth. And let the space between each cauterization be of the width of a digit: and let the cauterization be olive-sized.
Sometimes a cauterization is made in the middle over the top of the buttock in question. Therefore, there are four cauterizations.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, as the form for cauterization of dislocation of the buttock preceded, do so with one: let the circle contain the entire buttock.
And burn the thickness of the skin entirely.
This is the method of cautery for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the spine itself and does not extend to the hip and thigh.
If it extends to the hip and thigh, then cauterize the area with two cauteries above the hip, over the spot where the patient indicates there is pain. Apply a fourth cautery with your instrument, touching the lower part of the spine for a brief moment: let the cautery be surgical.
And the depth of the cautery should correspond to the thickness of the skin.
And if the patient indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes, then cauterize the area where he indicates with three, four, or more cauteries if needed.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is below the knee in the direction of the thigh, then cauterize the area where he indicates with a single surgical cautery.
And be careful in every cautery you perform, so that you do not conclude with a cautery that burns the nerve or the large artery, and thereby cause harm or contraction to the patient.
And I myself have indeed seen one and another case where those who cauterized above the spine concluded with the cautery, and the thigh became swollen until a tumor followed, and the entire foot was perforated and rotten: then ensued bowel leakage, and death followed that.
And if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize both according to this method.
And some wise men have said that in the cautery of the spine, this is the method of the cautery. Make a blade of iron like the palm's half in diameter, and at its mouth let it be according to the thickness of a finger-nucleus, or slightly less. And within that blade let there be a third blade.
And let the space between all the blades be of the quantity of a thumb's knot: and let the blades be open from two parts: and let their height be as one knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron fitted centrally in the blades.
Then let it be heated in fire until it becomes red and casts sparks: then let it be placed on the surface of the fish's side lying on the healthy side. Cauterize him with three round cauteries in one pass.
Then let it rest for three days. Afterwards, dress with butter: and let the wound remain open for many days. Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Albucasis says, "I use this kind of cautery rarely, because of the fear it inspires: and therefore, because few wait for it.
However, it is one of the good cauteries for those who can endure it, and he finds its place.
The cautery with medicinal applications is as follows: make two blades with a perforated armilla through which the door's cardo, made of bronze or iron, descends. The height of these blades should be two knots, or similar to that.
And let there be a space that is between the quantities of the thickness of the fingers, and may the lower and upper parts be open: and let them contain each other according to this form.
Then place it on the rib, lying sick person on the healthy side. And compress your hand on the rib greatly. Then pour between two circles from warm water, which has been heated slightly with fire, and hold it for the quantity of an hour: and the sick person should tolerate its bite and its burning, for he found the bite to be like fire until the biting ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe the warm water from the rib entirely with sweet water: then let it be for three days.
And place butter over it until the blackness of the burn is removed: then let it be for a few days, and drain the pus from it. For it is the last in healing.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or the leg, make for him a poultice that contains water, according to what you did for the rib equally.
And this is the measure of warm water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines. Take alkali and unburned lime, half of each: rub both, and put them in a new pot, whose lower part is pierced with one small hole, according to the quantity that the radius will enter: then place under the bottom of this pot another treated pot: and throw over the alkali and lime from sweet water, which submerges both up to the finger: after which you should compress them with your hand using good compression: then remove the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the treated pot.
Then aggregate that water entirely, and cast it over another lime: and stir until it is renewed.
It will then be very sharp and strong in its power, which is administered in many medical operations, and in cauterizing other members. Because it effects the operation of fire itself.
And from the medicines are those with which they cauterize the anchusa, even as testia and mel anacardi, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen, in his narration, reported the cure of a certain man from the ancients, by which he was cured of pain in the anchusa and sciatica: and he praised it greatly. And he said that he did not require any other cure, and because he was cured from a single bath, until he reported that perhaps he had entered the bath expecting to be cured, and emerged from it already healed.
And it is to be taken from the green astringent: and if the green one is not found, take the dry, recent; and pound it much with a little oil, and apply it over the anchusa where there is pain, or the thigh, or in the hip: and bind it, and let it remain for a quantity of three hours, or until the patient feels the relief from the application. Then insert it into the bath.
When therefore his body becomes moist, insert him into the bed. For the pain diminishes, and he is cured.
And know that it is not fitting for anyone to use cautery with these medicines, unless after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides who said that the dung of goats, when used with cautery on the sciatic vein, benefits it: and the cautery is performed in this manner. A woolen cloth is taken and soaked in old oil, and placed over the deep spot, which is between the big toe and the second toe, and it is closer to the second toe.
Then take the dried goat dung, and ignite it on fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it over the woolen cloth, and remove it while it is still burning out. Then repeat this process. Therefore, do not cease to perform this until sensation returns over the region up to the anus, and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinium cautery.
¶ Cauterization for Back Pain.
Sometimes back pain occurs from multiple causes, such as a fall, a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar conditions, due to the infusion of cold and wet matter. Indeed, cautery does not apply in any of these cases except in one specific instance, which is caused by the infusion of cold and wet matter.
Therefore, after the patient has evacuated with foul pills and similar substances, three lines should be marked on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the patient's almeda (a measure), and then five cautery burns or more should be performed along each line, according to the strength of the patient's tolerance: and the cautery should be performed with a cautery-needle.
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries or four, with a medium flat cautery, according to this form.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing for recently acquired hemorrhoids.
This illness often occurs in small infants.
And the sign of its onset in children is: a stricture that occurs during breathing at the moment of lifting and movement, and you find the last vertebra of the spine and its nodes, which have already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
And when you see this and wish to do so, then cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form.
And let the cautery take effect over the entire surface of the vertebra equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebra with a punctiform cautery for two lines or three, and let the points be close to each other.
Then care for the area until it heals, along with what we have said.
And beware, do not apply the cautery to the hemorrhoid that forms during nerve spasm.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing for Gout and joint pains.
When joint pains are caused by cold humors that flow into any part of the body, and when these pains occur in the feet, according to the custom of physicians, they call this condition Gout.
When therefore the treatment of Cold Gout does not relieve the pains, then cautery will remove them.
And it is that you cauterize him after evacuation around the circumference of the foot joint with many cautery applications: and let the cautery be Oleate.
And if you need to puncture the face of the foot, then do so with cautery punctures. And if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this happens often, then cauterize it over each knee with three or four cauterizations from all sides, using this Clavilian cautery.
And if more cauterizations are necessary for you, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
And if the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said from the cautery in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, then puncture around the ulna and radius, as two lines are traced.
And if pains remain in the fingers, then puncture them, over each knot and over the palm of the hand.
And if the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
And do not evacuate the patient with good regimen or through the intake of medicines. For if a good regimen is made and the phlegm is expelled, he shall be healed by the aid of God with this cautery.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing in Wounds.
When a rupture occurs in the inguinal region and the intestine descends down to or around the testicle, and it is close and beginning: then you must order the patient to cease all nourishment on that day. And let him use leniency, that the feces may descend from his abdomen.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and order him to hold his breath until it comes out, or until the intestine becomes apparent around the abdomen.
Then reduce it with your fingers and make marks with a cauterizing tool under the rupture on the opening of the pectineus muscle, using marks where the extremity resembles the middle of a circle above the body.
Then apply the cautery with this form to it until it becomes white and expels pus. Then reduce the intestine, or that which has descended, back to its natural concavity. Then place your hand on the location to prevent the intestine from coming out: and you have now incised between the thighs of the patient, and placed a pad beneath him, and another assistant stands over his thighs and another over his chest holding the hands.
Then place the cautery over the mark with your hand holding it straight. And hold it until you achieve the mouth with it: or iterate with it by another way if you have not achieved the mouth with it at first up to the mouth.
And observe prudently from the exit of the intestine in the hour of your cauterization, lest you burn it, and let it happen over the sick person through this to death or great evil.
And know that when you do not achieve the mouth with the cautery, your operation does not succeed.
And the cautery for infants should be subtle, according to their measure.
Then care with the other ointments until it is cured.
And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days until the wound is healed.
And you should provide nourishment for the duration of its cure, which will soothe its stomach: so that the intestine does not come out during effort and defecation.
Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a well-made bandage, and let him wear it for forty more days.
And he should be relieved from labor, overeating, and loud voices.
For when he follows this regimen, he is completely cured.
And I will say the cure for Ruptures with Incision in its chapter.
When Ruptures occur in the other part of the abdomen and are beginning to develop, and the force should not be increased, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and that which is burned should from then on be as one-third of it. Then care for it itself, with what we have said: and nothing shall be added.
And some of the first have said: Let the rupture be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with cauterization, and a line is placed across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with the pincered cautery.
But the cautery should first be easier and better to use.
¶ The manner of cauterizing for pain due to accident or impact.
Head 48.
When pain occurs in certain members due to an accident or impact, and that pain persists for a long time without relief from medicine, then it should be cauterized with the Puncti cautery.
And the cautery should be of the size of the member, and suitable for its thickness, weakness, strength, and any twisting or pain from it.
If therefore it is cured by the cautery at first, that is good. If not: then apply the cautery to it again.
For it is customary with such pains that they change from one member to what is adjacent to it. Therefore, you should apply the cautery to them until the patient is cured.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes healed by cauterization with maximum intensity. And especially the species of leprosy which results from the putrefaction of phlegm and melanchole: therefore when you wish to cauterize it, consider.
If therefore the leprosy is incipient and you have treated it as we said in the division, and it does not subside or remain stationary: then fear that the corruption might spread over his entire complexion. Therefore, cauterize him with five applications: one in the middle of the head, a second below it toward the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on either side of the horns [temples], and one behind on the joints of the neck.
And the last time, apply your hand with the cautery gently until it makes a small impression in the skin, and let the scales be removed from there. This will facilitate the expiration of gross vapors from that area, and cauterize the spleen as well, according to how it preceded.
But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly apparent, then you must use these cauterizations which we said in the head, and a cauterization on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on both maxillas, and two cauterizations on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large cauterization on the hypoglossus near the root of the tail and one above it in the almeidati: and two cauterizations on the flanks: namely, on each flank with one, and two cauterizations on both knees: one on each knee, and two on both shoulders, and two on both elbows, and two on both armpits: and cauterize it over every joint, from the joints of his fingers' hands and feet: and cauterize over every heel of his feet, and the flexor muscles of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are above the very heel, so as not to burn them.
And sometimes the apex of the penduncle is cauterized with one cautery, and another over the mouth of the stomach, and yet another over the ileum.
And know that the more cautery you apply, the greater the benefit, and the more it confers.
And know that the sick do not find pain from the cautery as those who are healthy do: for their body is already numbed.
And the cautery should be of appropriate size and thickness according to the limbs and joints, as specified by the kinds of instruments.
Then care for the cautery with flour of herbs and honey, and other treatments until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing in Stupor.
When some limb falls into stupor and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and yet does not heal, then cauterize the stupefied limb with cautery, according to the magnitude of the limb or its thickness.
And let your cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin. Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes the cautery is applied to a certain stupor that occurs in the hand and foot, at the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the stupor is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione nervorum mouentium corpus.
Caput LI.
When Albaras is old and nothing is added to it by the skills of medicine: then cauterize over it with a deeper cautery slightly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and the color thereof is changed.
Then cure it with a powder of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossae, and pigeon blood, and hawk blood: take one part of each: mix all these together, and apply them on a cloth, and let them adhere to the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.
When Cancer is beginning and its growth can be stopped: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it revolves.
Wise men have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
But I do not find that to be advisable: for I fear it might ulcerate, and I have seen it happen often.
And it is more appropriate to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with multiple cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.
When any has Adubelati and its maturation is delayed, either because of excess causing it, or because of the weakness of the infirm, when there is a small amount of blood, or because of time and the desire to hasten its maturation, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries pricking. Then let it go. For itself will hasten its maturation.
If you wish to make a puncture with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this form.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the infirm, so that the course may be aided by pure blood.
Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing in cases of malignant corrosion.
Head IV.
Corrosive is nothing but corruption in a walking member, and it consumes it: just as fire devours dry wood.
If therefore you see the corrosive in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then use many cauteries heated by fire, small and large clavillia, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosive is.
Then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing remains thereof entirely.
Then let it be released for three days, and place upon the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil until all eschars are eradicated and all corruption is gone.
Then treat it with ointments promoting flesh growth.
If therefore you find that healthy flesh grows in three days without any corruption, it is good.
And if not: then reapply the cautery to what remains from the corrupted areas.
And when necessary, it is treated by corroding with a sharp medicine. It rises therefore in the place where the cautery was applied.
Indeed, the cautery with fire is more rapid in healing: and I have already said that the cautery with sharp medicine is discussed in division: therefore take it there when you need it.
On the method of cauterizing the fingers and toes.
Chapter LV.
This illness often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a coarse, filtered substance that injures the foot.
And the cautery for these conditions is according to two methods: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
As for the cautery with fire, you should use a cauterizing concave implement similar to an eagle's feather: it should be made of iron, according to its size to hold a claw from all sides, and have fine edges.
Then place the ignited object on the clamp. Then turn the hand with the cautery around the circumference of the clamp until the cautery reaches the depth of the clamp: and let it remain for three days until pus begins to discharge. Then plaster it with bad laurel leaves, crushed with salt, and let the plaster remain on it overnight. It will be uprooted from its roots.
Then care for the wound with flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
If they do not turn and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then apply cauterization with warm water. And take a cannula of brass, iron, or vulture's feather, and place it on the clamp or aloof. Then project a small quantity of water from the cannula: hold your hand and turn it with slight compression so that the edge of the cannula impresses on the root of the clamp, and let the warm water find its way to the depth, to the root of the clamp: and let the patient remain for about an hour after the mordication of the warm water.
Then remove it, for the clamp is uprooted along with its roots.
Do this one after another until you reach all those that are on the body.
Then care for them after they are uprooted with flesh-generating ointments.
On the manner of cauterizing in Tremor.
When a person experiences Tremor from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or from some other cause: then it must be that you cauterize it with four or five cauterizations over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra with a cauterization, and on his chest with a cauterization, and over his stomach with a cauterization.
For Tremor is quietened by cauterization with olive oil, and speedily brings about the health of the cold illness.
On the manner of cauterizing Albathir.
Head 57.
Sometimes Albathir, which is a term for foul pustules formed from corrupted fatty substances, are expelled from the body.
Therefore, when they appear, it must be that the head of the pustules is cauterized with a subtle cauterization using myrtle wood, the end of which is ignited with fire. Or with the root of long aristolochia. Or with a lens-shaped cauterization.
And sometimes they are cauterized admenul at the beginning of their expulsion according to this manner: and do not increase: and the excess is broken, causing them to be cured.
However, it must be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
On the manner of cauterizing during a blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Many times a blood flow from an artery occurs, which has been cut near the wound, and this happens externally, or near the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of the member, and similar cases: and it becomes difficult to cut through it.
When therefore this occurs to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger on it: and press it strongly until the blood is compressed under your finger and nothing escapes from it.
Then place in the fire small olive oil cauterizes in great number: and blow upon them until they are intensely ignited.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is disrupted, and apply the cauterize over the vein. Afterward, remove your finger quickly. And hold the cauterize until the blood is cut off.
If the blood is expelled when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery and you extinguish the cauterize, then take another cauterize quickly from those prepared in the fire.
Therefore, do not cease to do this with one after another until the blood is cut off.
And beware that you do not burn the nerve there, and that some other evil happens to the weak patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods. Or with cautery, as we have said. Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted. For when it is extracted, the extremities thereof are drawn together, and the blood is cut off. Or it should be ligatured with thread in a strong ligature. Or let medicines with the property of cutting blood be placed upon it, and let it be bound with a suitable bandage constriction.
Whoever performs the amputation with a ligature and constriction with a cloth, or by placing combustible materials, does not entirely achieve it except rarely.
If, however, this happens to someone, and there is no physician or medicine at hand, then he should begin by placing the index finger on the orifice of the vein itself, as we have described, and by strongly constricting it until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound and over the artery. And the finger should not be removed until the blood is cooled and congealed with cold water of great refrigeration, and then it may be cut off.
And meanwhile, he should consider what is needed from the cautery or from medicine.
¶ On Incision, Puncturing, and Phlebotomy in Wounds and Similar Conditions.
We have already stated in Chapter One that every illness in which it is appropriate to use the cautery and burning medicine, and the occasions of its use, and its causes, and the instruments thereof, and the forms of cautery.
And I have placed there chapters from the vertex to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter along the same way: that which alleviates what is sought by the seeker.
And before I begin with this, my sons, you must learn that which is here from fear of what is in the first chapter concerning cautery.
And because of this, it is necessary that caution be more severe therein, for in the operation which is in this chapter, oftentimes evacuation with blood occurs, with which life stands at the opening of the vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of the exit, or cure of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which there is associated trembling, fear, and death befalls many of them.
And I advise you that this hesitation not fall upon you, for sometimes such individuals with such illnesses happen to you in this art. For among them is one who is angered by his illness, and death is light to him because of the vehemence with which he finds his sickness and the length of his wickedness. And when the illness is from fear, which signifies death.
And among them is one who gives his benefactor, and enriches you with him, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful.
Therefore, you ought not to agree to him who comes to you from those whose measure is such. And let your caution be greater than your cupidity and your greediness. And do not presume upon anything from it unless after certain knowledge, which is verified among you by a succession that has achieved a worthy outcome.
And make use in the cure of all your sick, prognosis and direction concerning that for which health will be appropriately achieved.
In that there is for you assistance in the attainment of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, my children, his wisdom, and may he not take away your direction and inspiration: for that is in his hand.
And I have indeed arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into sections, according to how it preceded in the Chapter on Cauterization, from the neck down to the feet: so that you may find what you wish from it and where you need it.
¶ Concerning the cure of water that aggregates in the children's heads.
Chapter I.
Know that this illness often occurs in children after birth: or when the midwife tightens the child's head without delicacy.
And it also occurs from a hidden cause which is not known.
And I have indeed never seen this illness in anyone other than children: and death hastened for every one of them that I saw. Therefore, it seemed to me appropriate to omit the operation for it.
And I indeed saw among them a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head enlarged every day until he could not sit upon himself because of the greatness of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture, either aggregates between the skin and the mouth: or aggregates under the bone above the jaw.
And the operation in that case, if there is moisture between the skin and the mouth, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single crack in the middle of the head with a width: and the length of the crack should be about two nodes until the moisture flows.
And this is the form of spatumilis.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two cracks according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the openings of the head from every part: and water is depressed when you press it with your hand to the interior, and nothing is hidden from you: then it is necessary to make three cracks in the middle of the head according to this manner.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture. Then close the cracks with bandages and wool. Then apply embrocation from above with wine and oil for five days.
Then release the bandage, and care for the wound with cloths and ointments.
And do not cease to bind the head with equality. And food for the sick should be of a dry but slightly moist nature until the member is strengthened and cured.
And another measure of incision is that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water are apparent.
For sometimes there is more at the back, or at the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Therefore ascend with the incision where you see the abscess and collection of water, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut the artery, and a blood flow occurs, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ Concerning the Incision of Arteries behind the Ears.
Head II.
When catarrhs affect someone's eyes or chest, and the condition worsens despite medical treatment not providing relief: then more effective treatment is to incise these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, the sick person should shave their head. Then rub the area with a rough cloth to make the arteries visible. Then the sick person should tie their neck with any cloth. Then consider where the vein pulses. And the locations are the areas behind the ears that are depressed: and it is rarely concealed, except in some individuals.
Then mark with cauterization on both sides: and cut both with a spatula on each side sharply, the incision arriving at the opening: and let that be done through the width of the head.
And if you wish, introduce the spatula under the artery, and cut it upwards with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
For when the vein is cut, blood issues forth with a pulsating flow, rising to the interior in frequent leaps.
If the artery does not become apparent by touch, then one must measure from the ear the width of three fingers. Then mark with cauterization, and cut until you reach the opening.
And what needs to be drawn from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will draw more or less than that. Do this in accordance with the quantity which you see fit from the condition of the patient and the filling of his artery.
Then consider the wound. Then if anything remains up to the opening, cut that out, so that a hot abscess does not occur: then suture the wound with needles made of linen thread.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
¶ For the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When it happens to a man that he has old hemicrania, or acute catarrh due to acrid humors and the heat of times, or old soda, vehement, and similar to these: and is treated with methods of medical cure, and this does not confer that: then we have experienced in these diseases the extraction of arteries from the times, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
And the method of operation in the extraction is that the sick person shaves the hairs that are on the times, and directs attention to the apparent artery in the time. It is then shown to you by the pulse itself, and is rarely concealed unless in a few men or vehemence of cold.
If it is concealed from you, then the sick person should tie his head with any cloth he has: then rub the place with a rough cloth. Or use vapor from hot water until it becomes apparent to you by clear appearance. Then take the spatialis, which I formed for you before. Then scrape the skin with it readily, until you reach the artery. Then project the hook into it, and extract it upward until you extract it from the skin, and make it emerge from the tunics beneath it from all sides.
If the artery is thin, then wrap it with the hook's extremity. Then cut from it according to the amount by which its extremities extend and contract, so that no blood flow occurs. For if it is not incised and not cut, the blood does not rise completely.
Then evacuate from the blood ana 6 unciae, until .3.
If the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a double, strong thread of silk or sinew, so that putrefaction does not occur before the wound heals and there is a flow of blood.
Then incise the excess, which is between the two ligaments. Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until its extremities, and let it hold its place in the same operation.
And it is better to do so, unless the patient has a fever, or has a heated complexion. Since the cautery is among those things that help to end moist conditions. Therefore, it is better aid.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries to fill the place with old cloth, and to place there poultices properly made.
And after the dressing is changed with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with linen, until it heals.
If during the operation a flow of blood from the artery occurs, then hurry to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with cloth: and grip firmly until the blood is stopped. If none of those are present for you, then place your finger over the spot, until the blood congeals. And apply embrocation to the place with water of vehement coldness, until the sharpness subsides and is tightened as required.
And because it is lighter and easier for the extraction of the artery, cauterize the vein with this cauterium having two knives: let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to almagdatus. Yet they have much less sharpness than two knives. For if they are sharp like two knives, the coldness rushes to both: and do not strike the flesh with speed. For when there is a certain thickness in them, the heat of the fire remains in them, and the flesh is cut quickly. Therefore, this must be better for every work, and lighter, and easier.
And this is the form of the cauterization.
And let the space between the two knives be the width of a finger, after you mark two places with cauterization: and extinguish both fires greatly until they reach the opening, and strike the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities may elongate. For they do not become completely consolidated with this cauterization.
Head IV.
¶ Concerning the care for persistent acute tear flow from the eyes.
When there are frequent tears, and the course of them is from the veins that are above the skull externally: and medicine does not confer anything on them with medicines, and you see the face of the sick already reddening, and he feels a crawling in his forehead, as is the crawling of ants: and his eyes are emaciated, moist, so that now the hairs of them are corroded with corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the acuteness of the tears: then the ancients required this cure by this operation, and they named it a cure, with the Knife.
And you should order the sick to shave the hair that is on his forehead. Then make three incisions evenly spaced according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of each incision be as long as two fingers, and one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly according to the length of the forearms, and the third from the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on both sides: and stretch your hand away from the continuity of the two lower jaws, and let the width of each incision be as much as three fingers joined together: and have prepared for you a slice of sponge, or many dried pieces of cloth, with which to dry the blood.
Then insert the blades of two sharp-pointed spatulas, whose immediate sequel is in the form described. From the incision which is on the side of the temple, to the second incision: and scrape off with it the entire skin that is between the two incisions, with scifa, which is above the mouth. Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision. Then extract this spatillum, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument, which is called the acute cuttler, gently from one side, not sharply from the other. And this is its form.
And place its acute side toward the flesh attached with skin, and its blunt side toward the mouth: and drive it forth until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: provided that the incision be continued until that which appears from the skin.
Then do this in the middle fissure until it reaches the other fissure.
And after an equal quantity of blood flows out, express the places from the fragments of coagulated blood.
Then place licinium from old cotto in every fissure, and place above them little cups soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar. And see that no hot abscess occur.
And on the third day untie the ligature, and administer a strong infusion with warm water. Then care for it with basilicon ointment and other ointments used for wounds until it is cured.
Caput V.
¶ Concerning the care of acute tears and catarrhs affecting the eyes from within the head.
When acute, severe, and constant catarrhs occur to someone, and you see his eyes emaciated, narrow, and already weakened in their appearance: and the eyelids ulcerated, and hair falls from them, and there is a sharp pain deep in the head, hurting, and accompanied by sneezing: then take from these occurrences what those materials and catarrhs do not come, unless from many veins.
And better treatment for them is this. And you should shave the patient's forehead. Then make one incision in the fissure in the middle of the forehead, or slightly wider on the other side, and begin from the left time towards the right time: let the incision reach the mouth. Extend your hand from the temporal bones, which move near mastication, until the mouth is exposed: then dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate between the two lips of the incision with an old cautery, or with forceps made of linen. Then ligate from above with sutures: and moisten the sutures with wine and oil, so that no hot abscess occurs.
And when you dissolve it and see that the hot abscess is diminishing, then you should warm the mouth until flesh begins to grow there.
Then care for it with an exsiccative regimen that promotes the growth of flesh: as, for example, if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, prepare a paste from these, and apply it to the growth of flesh in such wounds.
Head VI.
¶ Concerning the care for what falls into the Ear.
All that falls into the ear is of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or similar to a stone, such as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, such as beans and peas: or it is a fluid substance, such as water and vinegar and the like: or some animal matter.
When therefore a stone falls into the ear or any kind of stone which is not added and does not grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then drop something from violet oil or sesame oil into the ear. Then administer the extraction of it, and make him sneeze when you place [the substance] in, and plug the nostrils at the approach of sneezing. After you put fragments from cloths or wool around the ear, and extend the ear upward.
Many times it will come out with this care.
If it does not come out, then administer the extraction with Gosti, i.e., fine Pizigania powder: the form of which is as follows.
If it comes out with Gosti, it is good.
And if not, then administer the extraction with a fine hooked needle of few doublings.
If it does not come out through that, then make a tube of copper, and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear much, and plug what is around the tube with softened caera (a type of plaster) so that there is no passage except through the tube: then extract it with your strong suction.
Many times it will come out with what we have described. If it does not come out this way, then take from helkalimbat or from vinegar, i.e., prepared gluten with which birds are caught, a small quantity: and place it at the end of the radius after you wrap something suitable around it properly. Then insert it into the opening of the ear with ease, after you dry the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incise before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the measure of the incision is that the phlebotome for the invalid first in cephalic: and draw from him blood according to the measure of its virtue. Then make the invalid sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear next to the fat in the depressed area itself: and let the incision be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone; then remove it along with whatever is possible for you with the instruments.
Then attend to the incision according to your hour with speed and care until it heals.
If the matter falling into the ear is from one of those grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If it does not yield to you for extraction, then take a spatillum thin, fine, according to this form.
And administer with it the excision of that species of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do this when you think that that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear until you place many fragments thereof: then remove them with forceps, or with a fine hook, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it should be facilitated.
In water that enters the ear, the invalid should use a sneeze when first placed there: and now his ear is filled with some amount of old fluid: and he is lying over that ear in which is the water. If therefore it emerges through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a digit, thin, soft, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the patient insert one from those into his ear hole: and let one stone fall from his foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone that is in the ear. Therefore let him continue doing this with the stone and the stone until all the water emerges.
And now water is emerging such that you may take one end of a reed or a splinter and insert it into the ear: and ignite the other end with fire until most of it burns. Then iterate with another reed and do this many times until all the water emerges: and extract it using a tube according to what has been previously stated on the stone.
In extracting an animal entering there, if it is of a small body, such as a louse, and similar to it, care for it as I said in the division.
But if it is of a large body and apparent to the senses, then use a forceps and hooks for its extraction: and this will be easier than all that is held in the ear.
In extracting a worm generated in the ear, when you care for it as we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not confer relief: then you should examine the ear in the sun. If therefore something from the worms is apparent there, then extract it using forceps or with fine hooks.
If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose form is thus, narrow below, wide above: and insert the fine end according to the quantity which the sick person can bear into the ear: then suck with that strong suction. Perform this many times until all the worms emerge.
If, however, they do not obey you to exit, then surround the wound with a probe and knife as I said in the stone.
If they do not emerge with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients used for the destruction of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let the application be with which you pour oil and medicines into the ear using this instrument, whose form is depicted here. As you see, make it from silver or copper, narrow below with a small hole, and wide above.
Let it be such that the piston in the canal of the cannula is made somewhat of metal, not centered exactly. And if you wish, take a rod, wrap it at the end with wool in a suitable winding: then project oil, or juice, or what you wish from these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear. Then insert the rod wrapped with wool above, and express it with your hand using gentle compression until the oil is pushed into the concavity of the ear, and the sick person feels it internally: and that which is poured into the ear may already be warmed slightly by fire: and beware that nothing which is distilled into it is very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
Head VII.
On the care of the complication of the ear.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And it has already happened that opillation in the meatus of the ear occurred to some people either from a wound or from flesh arising there.
And this opillation sometimes occurs in the deep part of the ear canal, where it does not affect hearing; and sometimes it happens at the outer part of the ear canal to a lesser extent, and affects that hearing.
That which occurs in the deep part of the ear and which cannot be seen is in many dispositions difficult to cure.
And for that which affects the hearing, you should place the ear of the sick person in the sun and look into it. Then, if you see opillation apparent, open it with a slender spatule whose form is as follows: its end has a very small width, with one part of it being acute, and the rest of the spatule has two gentle sides to avoid damaging the ear.
If therefore the opillation is from flesh arising in the meatus of the ear, then hold it with a slender hook and cut it with violent dispatch until all the flesh is removed.
If the opillation is in the deep part of the ear, then take a slender, gentle probe and heat it slightly with fire. Then insert it into the meatus of the ear.
If therefore you feel the opillation along with the great hearing impairment that the sick person has, try to open it with dispatch, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place a wick in the ear according to the width of the opening, which you have covered with Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are secure about the healing of the wound.
Or take a wick, and steep it in rosewater, and powder it with ground zegi, and use it.
If you see the ear already suppurating: then you must remove the wick, and let it be with another wick which you cover in cerate made with rose oil until the hot suppuration is settled: then care for it until it is cured.
If, however, there is a flow of blood: then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear: and continue with the remaining cure which stops the flow of blood as described in the treatise on distillations.
On the care of eyelids.
Chapter VIII.
These conditions of the eyelids (Althelil) sometimes are humid, and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you must treat them with forceps: or with forceps, and incise them from their roots with a spatula. Then place ground zegi over the affected areas.
If, however, blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens-shaped cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after incision. For they often return when something remains from their roots. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ Concerning the care of Granulomas of the Eyelid.
Head IX.
Often something occurs on the eyelids that is similar to Granulum in strength and hardness, and for this it is named Granuloma: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore, the operation on them is this: consider then if the Granuloma is progressing, what appears from the eyelid and moves to all parts, and its nature is easy.
Therefore, make a incision over it from side to side. Then scrape it from all sides with ease until it comes out. Then suspend it with a forceps, and cut it out.
If the excision is not prepared for you, so that you can cut it out only after you have penetrated the eyelid with a slight incision, then it may harm the patient at some point.
If the incision is large, then suture it and care for it until it heals.
And if it is small, no evil will come to you from it. For ointment restores it and causes it to heal.
And if a stone is inclined toward the inner ear against the internal surface, then turn back the eyelid, and hang the stone with a hook: besides which you need an incision, and press it from all parts.
If the eyelid is extended by an incision, it will not harm anything.
Then wash the eye after the incision with the stone and salted water: and take care of the area until the sick person is healed.
¶ Concerning the care of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is the fat that forms in the upper eyelids' coverings: and this happens most often to children. It burdens their eyes and causes them cataracts in the morning, and they cannot look at the sun's light because their tears rush toward them. Because of this, you will see them always lying face down and sleeping on their faces, and their eyelids beneath their eyebrows are wet, which are now covered by swelling. The prominence of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And the method of its treatment is that the sick person places his head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare a small incision in it, and make from this incision a circular patch according to the size that contains the Axirnath from all sides. Then place it over the affected area, and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath gathers in the center of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that moisture with a probe incident and note the cracks running laterally, and let not that larger crack occur which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or you must find the skin entirely until you reach Axirnath, for Axirnath proceeds from the crack in many dispositions according to the form of the slice of white fat.
Therefore extract it with a cloth that you have moistened between your fingers to the exterior: and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed: and beware, lest in the crack you add moisture so as not to reach with a probe the eye and injure it.
If Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the crack, you should add moisture to the crack with some facility until Axirnath proceeds. Therefore extract it, as we have said.
Therefore immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with cloths.
And there are some who grind salt and place it in the depression of the crack, so that what remains from that moisture may liquefy.
Therefore care for it until it is healed.
If a hot abscess should occur in the area, then care for it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
On the methods of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid is softened, so that it wrinkles as it should not.
Chapter XI.
When eyelashes grow in the eyebrows beyond their natural course and become thicker: then they harm the eye, causing diseases such as frequent tears, softening of the eyelids, and whitish discoloration until the eye is destroyed for this reason.
And Ataxmir's eye is cured according to four methods. Or by cauterization with fire. Or with a sharp medicine, as prescribed in the chapter on cauterization. Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suturing. Or with a cane, as I will say.
You must place the patient's head in your lap. Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it turns, it is good. And if it does not turn, insert the needle into that part which contains the thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and let the needle with the thread penetrate upwards, and be close to the eyelashes, that is, close to the margin of the eyelid where the eyelashes grow. Then pull the thread towards the top with the eyelid, and turn it with a stick.
Then puncture the inner part of the eyelid under the additional eyelashes with a small probe from the larger tear duct to the smaller one.
Then extract the thread, and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid. Then mark the eyelid with cauterization as it should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Truly, it must be shaped according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, for this varies among people.
For some require that a large quantity be excised from the eyelid according to the amount that is softened by the eyelid.
Then, using the spatula, cut between the two lines you have marked, and begin from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller one, and let the incision be near the natural eyelashes, as is the thickness of a radius.
Then insert the hook into one of the corners of the skin. Then excise that entire piece. Then缝合两层唇状物，用细羊肠线和针：并擦去血液，并使从两眉上方的线头溢出的多余部分粘合在一起，如果你愿意这样做；如果不，你无需在意。
Then remove the sutures and thread until three days or four have passed: then care for it thereafter.
And if you wish, remove the wound without sutures and care for it along with what dries and tightens it. For the eyelid will be elevated at the cauterization and suturing; but it will be better in the future.
This method of treating Ataxmir the ancients have taught.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.
And another method is for Ataxmir as well: and it is, that you mark a figure on the eyelid, which shall be like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then elevate the eyelid with three separate or aggregated hooks, according to the form that follows. Then cut away what is superfluous with small forceps, according to this form, with equality in the incision.
If, however, it is not possible for you to hold the hook and it is not equated: then take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the figure. And insert another thread nearby the larger lacrimal duct, and a third thread nearby the smaller lacrimal duct: and aggregate the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then lift your hand with an equal lifting motion, and lift the skin upon which the mark is made, as we have narrated.
Then aggregate the two lips of the wound with sutures: and care for it until it heals.
If, however, an abscess occurs at your incision or fissure: apply that abscess with a cautery, and similar substances from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens that the eyelashes also turn inward.
Therefore, you should use what we have said for the incision; but suturing is more artificial for both. Of the care of Ataxmir with canes.
And it is, that you turn the eyelid and incise the fissure which is inward, as I have narrated. Then make two canes or two thin sticks: the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be narrower than that of a spatia (a measure). And you have already incised at the extremities from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then join both with a fine thread to what remains superfluous from the eyelid, and tighten the two canes from both sides with a strong ligature, and remove it after a few days. For the skin tightened will die, blacken, and腐烂，直到自行脱落。
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with forceps. Then care for it until it heals.
When therefore it is consolidated, raise the eyelid: and the hairs will not irritate.
And this is the form of the two canes, which you should make according to this shape and size in length and width.
Head XII.
Of the removal of irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
The operation is this: take a fine needle and insert a fine silk thread into it, making it soft. Then aggregate its extremities, and bind both with a fine knot: let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then weave another fine thread under it briefly, and bind its extremities if you wish.
Then the patient should place his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun to determine the operation: for it is a subtle or small operation.
Then insert the awl with silk into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you withdraw it from above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair until it is above the silk thread: and insert that hair into the silk thread: if there is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the silk thread in the eyelid along with the natural hair.
If, however, the silk thread is pulled out and no hair comes out with it: pull the silk thread to the lower part, along with the thread you have prepared in it, until the silk thread emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with your eye: then you pull the silk thread and the thread. Withdraw both, and close the eye: and let it remain closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and grows above the skin.
If the hair is short, then either associate it with a longer hair from the natural hairs, and it will be drawn out along with it: or let it alone until it elongates over time, and then draw it out.
Chapter XIII.
When this condition happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Therefore, it is accidental from the consolidation of a wound, or a section, or a cauterization, and similar conditions.
And the method of treatment is this: you must find that consolidation, and separate its margins, and place something licit from linen between them, and bind it until it heals.
And it is not appropriate to use substances that dry and constrict in its treatment. For if you do that, the Alxatrati will return worse than it was. Instead, use substances that soften, such as foin, embrocation with water in which althea has been boiled, flaxseed, and dyaquilon ointment liquefied with some oil. Wrap something licit around it and care for it accordingly.
And your treasure in treatment is to use every ingenuity so that it does not consolidate according to the form it had at first.
And this operation that we have described is not more than a correction of the Alxatrati so that it does not return to the form it had completely in its place.
Of the care of Alxatrati which happens in the lower eyelid, and it is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which is made below is truly named Alxatrati. And it is natural and accidental.
And it is accidental, arising from a wound, or fracture, or cautery, and similar conditions.
And the way of operation in this is, that you take a needle with a double thread, and dip it in flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with a needle, and cut it with a broad spoon-like instrument. If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if it does not return to its shape as it should, take a needle and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it. Make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be at the two angles of the incision until they converge and form an angle: until they come together, this figure is formed, and it is the letter lambda in Greek.
Then remove that flesh in the amount of its sharp lower side, from what follows the eyelid. Then unite the separated parts: suture it with a wool thread.
Then care for them with what we have said about softening medicines and their applications until they heal.
And if Alxatrati occurs by means of a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it must be that you find the fissure flat beneath the eyelashes, even according to what has preceded. Then separate between the two lips with forceps, according to what we have said.
And the summary of the matter concerning the care of Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should be performed on it according to how it is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
For it is of many diverse forms. And the skilled artisan prepares the tool with whatever means are possible until it returns the figure to the natural form or one similar to it, and the patient himself, according to what is fitting for him from the operation and instruments in many disposals.
Head XV.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the sclera of the eye, and thereby prevents it from performing its natural operations.
Therefore, you must introduce the tip of the needle under the eyelid and lift it upwards: or extend it with a forceps. Then incise the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp but slightly obtuse: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula be removed without damaging the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you were easily separating the adhesion with facility, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it out with water: or distill into it through a sieve from zinc dissolved in water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a wick: and place on the eye wool soaked in alum: and after the third day use the sieve, and with solidified substances, until it is healed.
¶ Incision of the nail and prominence of tear-producing flesh.
Head XVI.
Know that the nail is according to two modes. Or it is nervously composed: and it is similar to a hard, fine sieve. Or it is not nervously composed, similar to white moisture that when touched by iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, it tears and the hook does not stick in it.
And neither of these types begins unless from the larger tear-producing gland, gradually flowing until it covers the vision and prevents both the light and the movement of the eye.
And the method of incising it is this: the sick person should place his head in your lap. Then open his eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand. Then grasp the nail with a hook of few doublings and extend it upwards. Then take a needle and insert into it a thread from horse hair, ox hair, or goat hair: and let the thread be strong, and prick its end slightly with the needle, and fix it in the middle of the nail. Then penetrate it with the needle and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and peel off the side of the nail that follows the pupil as if you sew it with the thread until its end.
Then incise the remainder at the root of the lacrimal gland with a sharp spatula or with small forceps: and remove the natural lacrimal flesh, so that no continuous flow of tears occurs from this.
And sometimes the claw is extended with a single forceps: or with a thread, as we have said. Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, whose form is as follows.
And be careful that the delicate corneal layer is not touched by the spatula, and no rupture occurs, lest the pupil be perforated.
Then after the incision, sprinkle something of powdered salt or筛过的锌矿粉 into the eye, and leave it there until another day. Then care for it with what is necessary until it heals.
If the claw is not nerveous, and you cannot introduce a needle into it, nor can a forceps be fixed in it, then this species of claw is treated multiple times with medicines, and is healed as I described in the division.
If you wish to incise it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a sharp spatula, gentle and of feeble edge, as follows in form. And scrape the claw from above with subtlety and precision. If you see that it rarifies and breaks down, and you apply reason to it, then drop from your hour into the eye through a sieve made of zinc ore, or through a red sieve, or powdered salt, and medicate the eye until another day.
Then iterate over the same operation until everything is removed. Unless a hot abscess is in your eye; then dismiss the former and treat the abscess until it is cured.
Then iterate the operation over the same with reasoning until it is cured.
But if the prominence of the tear gland causes great harm to the eye, suspend it with a hook and cut from that part: but not the last incision, so as not to affect the flow of tears.
Then apply a drop of red tear-sieve or made from zinc, until it is cured.
¶ Incision of Alguardenic, and flesh grown in the eye.
Head XVII.
It arises in some eyes of humans when red flesh is formed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a rose balloon花椰菜. (Note: "balaustinae" likely refers to "balsamin," but "balanista" seems to be a mistake in this context, possibly meant to be "balaustia," which is similar to "balsamina" or could refer to a type of flower like balsam.)
And the operation for this condition is such that the sick person places his head in your lap. Then open his eyes, and remove that entire flesh with hooks suitable for this purpose: and hold it with one forceps or by hand.
Then cut the flesh first, until all of it is removed with forceps. And beware of the eye, so as not to injure it during the operation: and let your incision be such that you cut it, or with a lancet, which we have described in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which the asebel is gathered, according to what its form may be after this chapter.
And when your incision is completed, and the whole alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or distil into it red powder, and similar substances from medical corrosives: and place over the eye a cloth with white paste outside: to secure it from hot apostema.
And if something remains from the alguardenici and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot apostema: then let the eye, and care for it with what cools the apostema.
Then repeat the operation over it until it is healed.
And similarly proceed with flesh added which occurs in the eye of this kind.
Yet it is necessary to leave the cure of any weak eye from the natural way or from the accidental way by operating with iron: and do not insert your hand in any of these operations until you see that that member can bear that operation.
¶ Concerning the removal of asebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII.
Asebels are red veins that are woven over the eye and prevent vision from its operation: and they weaken the eye over a length of days.
It is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye in which there is an asebel is strong, and there is no other illness in it except the asebel: then gather the asebel.
And it is that you should command the sick person to place his head on your lap.
Then suspend those veins with one hook or two according to your discretion: and let the hook be thin and double, according to this form, or let there be two hooks gradually in one body, according to this form.
Then gather those veins with thin forceps with subtlety, and cleanse the blood hour by hour until you see those veins removed from the eye and resolved: and beware lest you wound the eye with the sharp ends.
And let your operation be at midday in the sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you cut only those veins.
And when you have completed, then drop green or red dye into the eye: so that it may refine what remains from the sebum.
If, however, it is not possible for you to gather that entirely in that hour, then apply a poultice to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye: and let it remain for several days until the pain settles: and be secured from a hot abscess: then repeat over it according to the same method until it is cured.
And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ For reducing a dislocation from the ear to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
The physicians name this fistula as one that is treated with a cautery, or with sharp burning medicine, according to what preceded its description.
And if it is not cured, then there is no skill in it: except that you find over the suppurative lesion at its birth and draw out all the moisture which is in it and the pus until an opening is revealed.
And when therefore the opening is revealed, and you see in it corruption or blackness, then shave it off with an instrument whose form is this.
And it is called Asperi capitis.
Let it be made of iron, and let its head be round like a zafrir, which should be punctured with the puncture of a file, or with a fine puncture of aliskilfer: and place it over the corrupt bone site.
Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand slightly until you know that the corruption has been removed: and do this several times.
Then restore the site with drying astringent medicines.
And if therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh arises therein, and the course of healthy pus is cut off: and remains for forty days, and does not renew itself, and does not suppurate, and no accident happens therein: then know that it is now cured.
And if it is not so, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
And do this by probing the second bone with iron or with a sharp medicine: and when the opening is revealed, then take a trephine according to this form, let its iron end be triangular: and its wood be a pyramid thinned out to the end, as you see.
Then place it over the mouth: and let it be near the lacrimal: and lengthen your hand from the eye somewhat. Then turn your hand with the stick until it enters the nostril, and let the sick person feel it: by this, when he finds the wind coming out from there while holding his own nose.
Therefore then restore the place with medicinal astringents drying, as I have taught you.
When therefore flesh is born and the place becomes hard: then the material which was flowing to the external parts returns to the nose: hence it is milder over the sick person.
¶ On the Reduction of Protrusion of the Eye.
Head XX.
When the Eye protrudes completely and no harm or diminution occurs in vision, then it is necessary to reassure the sick person: subsequently phlebotomize him: afterwards place cups on the neck without incision, but with suction.
Then place over the Eye a liniment made from acacia, and aloes, and incense, and storax. Then bind the Eye from above with a bandage over the plaster with many powders.
And the measure of the powders is: take soft cloths, many, and let each cloth be doubled over four. Make many from them: then place one upon another according to the quantity that the Eye needs: then bind them with a hard cloth in a strong bandage.
And use the suction cups with suction without scarification.
Then remove the suction cups, and relax the tight eye day and night.
If the ligament should again soften, then it must be tightened much: then remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said.
If therefore you find that the eye has already returned to the natural state of the vitreous membrane, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, the poultices, the tightening, and the suction cups until it is cured.
¶ Of Incision of the Vitreous Membrane.
Head XXI.
When there is a disruption in the vitreous membrane, it then protrudes and comes out through the eyelids like a grain of vitreous substance, and disfigures the form of a person because of it, and one sees this: then an operation is to be performed as I describe, and you are to insert a needle from the lower part to the upper part at the root of the vitreous membrane.
Then insert another needle with a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and release the first needle in its place.
Then cut the place where the double thread is, and ligate with it a portion of the vitreous membrane around the needle: and tighten it much.
Then remove the needle and place wool soaked in albuminous fluid over the eye: and leave it there until the thread with the vitreous membrane falls out.
Then care for the eye with what strengthens it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the eye is drawn from all sides with a circle of cloth until the eye attains great prominence.
Then a thin probe is perforated, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the aqueous humor flows down, and immediately enter: then draw it until the wound is healed.
¶ Concerning the Treatment of Alconitis.
Chapter XXII.
This illness called Alconitis is not anything other than a pus that collects in the eye, similar to water descending, and it is not the eye itself.
And the method of treatment is to make the patient sit on a prepared seat, or in an upright position.
Then take the patient's head with your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts of your eyes. Then apply a compress to prevent it from descending, and clear the vision: and let the patient see as before: and if it does not descend below, know that it is water.
If the descent of the pus does not occur as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands. Then take a thin probe, and perforate it slightly above the corneal membrane at the point of attachment to the sclera in a coronal manner, until the pus exits.
When therefore it comes out, then drop hot water into the eye in which you have mixed honey: or hot water in which fennel has already boiled and honey: then treat with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Of the care of the water which descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already spoken of the kinds of water in division, and which is suitable for piercing, explaining by both word and deed, then receive that same according to health.
Therefore, you should cause the patient to sit between your hands in a square position, facing the light near the sun. And bind his healthy eye, tightening it greatly. Then, using your right hand, touch the eyelid of his eye that contains the water if it is the left eye; or use your left hand if it is the right eye.
Then, using your right hand, take the ampulla if the eye is the left; or use your left hand if the eye is the right.
Then place the tip of the ampulla near the crown at the thickest part of the radius in the white of the eye where the smaller lacrimal gland is apparent. Then push the ampulla with force and turn your hand with it until it penetrates into the white of the eye, and feel that the ampulla has now reached the empty space.
And it should be that the measure of the ampulla's journey is to the depth, measuring the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the crown of the eye. For you will see these things in the pupil of the eye due to the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the algamade up to the place where the water is. Then press it from below alternately one after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick man perceives that through which he opens his vision immediately, and the algamade in his eye.
Then rest for a while. If therefore the water descends, then remove it for a second, provided that the algamade does not exit.
When therefore it is applied and does not rise: then remove the algamade with ease, and you move your hand gradually.
Then dissolve something clear of gemstone salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then place outside the eye a whole tampon or soaked wool in rose oil and borax, and bandage the healthy eye.
We and those of our time place on it powdered cenno with alum.
If the algamade does not yield to you at the entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then you should take a spatule called Alberid, which has this form.
Therefore, pass it with the spatule only to the conjunctiva and do not put your hand into the aperture: and you must merely make a subtle pathway to the place of the algamade.
Then introduce the forceps, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the sick a bed adequately made, on which he may lie on his back in a dark room: and prevent him from all movements, and from coughing: and give him food that which soothes his nature: and let him not move his head to the right or to the left entirely.
And let the ligament be kept in its place until the third day.
Then release it in the dark room, and examine its appearance: and make him see things. Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
And it is not proper for him to do this during the hour of treatment or immediately after incision. Rather, you should remove it, because water rises quickly through a strong external influence.
If a hot abscess occurs, then you should release the eye before the seventh day: and correct it along with what calms the abscess until it is calmed. Then complete its appearance and place an oral remedy over his face so that his vision is regulated for a few days, while he remains in the dark room.
Then he should gradually leave the house and return to his usual surroundings.
And know that in saline solutions, the student is not excused from vision oftentimes: for then he must observe the operation closely.
And indeed one of those from Alayrac has come to us who said that in Alayrac a forceps was perforated so that water could be suctioned through it.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uosta, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est posibile, ut sit illud novum.
And these are the forms of species from magda, so that they may stand there for those who do not know them.
Let them be made of proper copper: and may their ends be triangular in the same manner, and let the end be acute.
Head XXIV.
¶ Concerning the care of flesh arising in the nose.
Sometimes flesh of various kinds arises in the nose, from which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet: and from this is cancerous flesh, stony, of dark color: and from this is what is soft flesh, not of dark color.
In that which is soft from these flesh growths, not malignant, nor cancerous, you should make the patient sit with his hand opposite the sun, and open his nostril, and cast a hook into those flesh growths. Then draw them to the outside, and cut what you have grasped with a sharp, thin, and pointed instrument from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been completely removed.
If anything should remain from that which cannot be removed, then shave it off with one of the thin instruments, carefully, until nothing remains from it. If, however, blood predominates over you, or a hot abscess occurs: then oppose it with what is necessary. If it is from malignant abscesses, then apply cauterization until the blood is stopped and all flesh is removed.
Then acetic acid, and water, or wine, should be applied to the nose after the incision. If, however, the nose is incised and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that it is now healed.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within is flesh grown in the upper nasal bones, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then you should introduce a linen thread of certain thickness, with many knots in it. Place the length between each knot equal to that of a finger, or less: and instruct the patient to insert one end of the thread into the nose with a rod or whatever is possible for him after he has done the same with some aromatic substance: and draw his breath until it reaches the septum and exits above his throat.
And indeed they often do this with Attomi's boys in the schools: and it is an easy thing for him who wishes to do so.
Then place two ends of the thread, one which exits from the nose, and the other which remains in the nose. Then apply the knife to cut the flesh at the knots that are on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh at the knots of the thread is cut.
Then extract the thread: and place in the nose after the blood has been removed, something mild that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days, or more, until the ointment dissolves all that remains of the flesh.
Then place at the end of the thing a管窥xbf小窗口[窗口]铜管 in the nose, for some days until it is cured.
If it requires treatment that dries it out, use that.
For the preparation for cleansing the head, take what oil and other medicines distill, and place them in the nose; make it of silver or copper: let it be similar to a lantern frame, open like a shell, and its aperture likewise.
And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a reed.
And the shell instrument for cleansing the head should be full and open. It should have a handle at its end, with which you can hold it when you warm oil or what you wish from juices and fluid substances in it.
Chapter XXV.
Thelul often arises at the extremity of the nose, grows larger, and increases with days until a deformity is evident in its appearance.
And on account of this, it is necessary to treat the Thelul at its onset and eradicate the entire lesion. Then place on the area a cautery or a burning medicine that remains in its place.
If therefore the incision is delayed until it grows larger, consider whether it is hard, dark in color, and has few sensations. Then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
For oft have I seen one who suffers from a boil, and great evil befalls him therefrom.
And if the boil is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that its incision is possible throughout, then empty the weak one, and cut it without fear, without covetousness: and care for the place with what dries and constricts until it is healed.
Head XXVI.
¶ Concerning the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear.
Know that when there is a loss of continuity in one of these cartilages, the operation conveys little benefit, except in some people.
Therefore, when something from it happens to someone, consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then bring the wound edges together with the suture, and care for it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the loss of continuity are already separated, and each part is healthy: then it is necessary to expose all parts visible from the skin, until they bleed. Then bring the two lips together with the suture, and tie them tight. Dust the wound with dragon's blood and pulverized frankincense: place above this powder a piece of transparent plaster, and another one of hardened plasters. Leave it tied for two or three days. Then untie it, and change the medicine. Leave it until the threads dissolve by themselves. Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suturing is that you should unite the continuity, either with needles, as we have narrated in suturing the abdomen: or unite the continuity with thread, as I have made you know.
**Chapter XXVII.**
**On the Extraction of Nodes on the Lips.**
Many people are afflicted with hard tumors similar to grains of herbs in the inner lips, and some are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn the lip and find over every knot of it, and hang it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Then fill the place after the incision with what was mentioned, rubbed until the blood is absorbed.
Then wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with it until the wounds heal.
**Chapter XXVIII.**
**On the Incision of Flesh Grown Over the Gum.**
Flesh often grows over the gum, which the ancients called abuluss.
Therefore, you should hang it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus to flow, or the blood.
Then place over the area what was mentioned, rubbed, or other styptic powders, drying agents.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut it a second time and cauterize it: for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter XXIX.
On the Reason of Teeth with Iron.
Sometimes, aggregations occur on the surfaces of teeth from the inner and outer parts, and between the gum layers. They are rough, nasty, and sometimes yellowish, turning green until the corruption reaches the gum, making the teeth foul.
Therefore, you should cause the sick person to sit between your hands, and place his head on your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth where you see the layers, and what resembles sand: until nothing remains of them. Similarly, do this with the blackness, greenness, yellowity, and other similar conditions until they are cleansed.
If therefore what is at the beginning of the reason there is to be removed, it is good: and if not, then apply the reason again on them on another day, the second day, and the third day, until the last study reaches what you wish.
And know that the tooth requires rasps of various forms and many figures: according to what is prepared for your operation. Therefore, the rasp used to scrape the tooth from the inferior part is different from the one used between the teeth, according to other forms.
And these forms of rasps should be prepared for you, which you will see.
Chapter XXX.
On the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
You should treat the tooth from its pain with every skill and be slow in its removal. For it is not replaced by its equivalent when it is eradicated, because it is a superior substance: until, when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it must be eradicated when the sick man is compelled to do so, that he may be strengthened and you may be certain of a painful tooth.
For many times pain deceives the sick, and they think that it is due to a spot in the tooth and eradicate it; then the pain does not cease until the sick tooth is eradicated.
For we have already seen this from the operation of phlebotomists.
For when the painful tooth itself is certified to you, then it must be cut around the tooth with a scaler, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps first gradually, until you shake it.
Then place the forceps in those locations with good placement, and hold the sick person's head between your knees: which you have now firmly held so that it does not move. Then pull the tooth straight, so as not to break it.
For if it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and introduce it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
For if the tooth is perforated or corroded, then you must塞住那孔洞用一块布：并用细棒的末端紧紧握着它，以防在用夹子夹持时断裂。
And you must carefully perform the cutting around the gum from all sides.
And keep your strength, so that you do not break it, and let the part remain, and return to the sick from that evil which is greater than his pain at first.
And beware, lest you do what inexperienced phlebotomists do in their haste, and through their boldness exceed what needs to be removed. Moreover, do not administer that which we have narrated.
For many times they bring about great illnesses in men, of which the more difficult ones are broken and all their roots remain, or some of them. Or they remove it along with certain bones of the jaw: as we have often testified.
Then mix it after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
And if a blood flow occurs from the places (this happens many times), then rub something from zegi on it and fill the place with it. And if you do not have zegi, cauterize it.
The forms of细齿镊子，最初用于移动牙齿的，应具有长的末端，短的手柄，粗壮的，以便在与牙齿压合时不会弯曲：应如你所见，手柄粗壮的，直到当你用力握持它们时，牙齿不会滑脱且不弯曲：末端短而直，并由铁制成或适当制作的木制镊子，末端直接。并且在它们的末端有齿，其中一些可以插入某些位置并以适当的力度紧固。
And sometimes the endings are made like the form of a bird's mouth which is called a stork, and they provide a strong constriction.
Chapter XXXI.
On the Extraction of Teeth, and the Removal of Fractured Lower Jaw Bones.
When something remains after the extraction of a fractured tooth, you should place butter over the area for one or two days until the site becomes softened. Then, introduce algaji or forceps whose ends resemble the beak of a bird called a stork. The form of the forceps is as follows.
Let the ends be made like a file from within: or like algashi.
If therefore these forceps do not suffice for extraction, then you should be careful about the root and remove all the flesh, and introduce the instrument called the Small Ram's Horn, whose form is as follows.
Let the end be short and somewhat thick: and do not immerse it, so that it does not break.
If therefore the root emerges through this, it is good. And if not, you should use these other instruments whose forms are as follows.
The form of the first triangular end, which has some thickness.
The form of the thin triangular end.
And with the other instruments and tools that preceded in the treatment of teeth.
And even if an animal is used with this instrument that resembles a large hook, of triangular shaped twisted extremity, and has some thickness to prevent it from breaking: and let it not be imbued.
And know that the instruments of the teeth are many: and similarly other instruments are not counted, and a skilled craftsman, subtle in his art, finds an instrument for himself, according to what the operation and diseases themselves indicate.
Since from the kinds of corruption they are to those to which the ancients did not refer an instrument, because of the diversity of their species.
If the jaw is broken from a mandible, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then examine it in its place with what fits it from the instruments and forceps which I said in the extraction of roots, and treat it with the gesture whose form is this.
Let there be something of thickness gradually, so that the mouth is tightened or held with it, and does not flee and depart until the mouth emerges: and restore the place with medicines suitable for that.
If, however, there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it is cured.
Head XXIII.
On the extraction of prominent teeth above others.
When teeth are prominent not according to their natural alignment, a ugly form results from this: and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is, virgins.
Therefore you must consider. For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and it cannot be placed, nor its cusp, nor the grinding surface of it be made possible: then eradicate it; and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it off together with this instrument, the form of which is as follows.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of iron, with its extremity greatly sharpened.
And let your cut be such that you cut it off over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that no other tooth is shaken.
If it is prominent and exposed to its grinding surface: then grind it with a grinding tool made of iron, the form of which is as follows.
Let it be wholly of iron, and its handle made of small greatly pointed projections, as with aawl by which teeth are gradually ground over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not shaken and falls: then smooth it, at the end shave it off with certain razors.
If it is a tooth from which a part has been broken and injures the tongue: then you must file it until the roughness of that break is removed and made even, and smoothed so as not to injure the tongue or corrupt speech.
Head XXIII.
On the Treatment of Teeth with Gold Wires.
When the anterior teeth are shaken and moved by a blow or accident: and the patient cannot hold food against it so that it does not fall: and you have treated them with styptic medicines, and the treatment was ineffective: then skill must be used to bind them with a gold wire: for silver turns green and rots after days: but gold never changes.
And let the thread be medium in thinness and thickness according to the quantity that it takes between the teeth.
And the form of retention is that you take the thread and introduce double its length between two healthy teeth: then weave it with the two ends of the thread among the moved teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the needle to the healthy tooth of the other part. Then repeat the weaving until you reach the part from which you began: and use your hand with subtlety and skill, until it is not entirely removed: and let your knot, where you draw the thread taut at the roots of the teeth, be such that it does not come loose.
Then cut the excess ends of the thread with forceps: and gather both, and turn them while holding: and keep them hidden between the healthy tooth and the moved tooth, so as not to injure the tongue: then let it be tightened in this manner until it remains.
If it is either loosened or cut, tie them with another thread, and let it hold fast with it for the entire time.
And this is the form of the Teeth, and the figure of retaining two healthy teeth and two moved teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that a tooth or two returns to its place after falling out and being placed there, and is retained as we have described, and remains in that position: and this is done only by a skilled and experienced craftsman.
And sometimes a piece from the jawbone is fitted: and it is shaped like a tooth and placed in its place, where the tooth is reinforced and tied, as we have said: and remains there, serving for a long time.
Chapter XXXIV.
Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which one is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
And the operation is to open the mouth of the sick person at the back of his head in your hand, and raise his tongue: then cut that nerveous ligament widthwise until the tongue is released from its compression.
And if there is something hard and knotted in it, and that is due to the healing of a wound, then thrust a curved instrument into it and cut it widthwise until you sever the ligament and release the knot.
And beware, lest there be a fissure in the depth of the flesh, and you cut an artery there, resulting in a blood flow.
Then wash the incision site with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Then place a thin linen cloth under the tongue, which the patient should keep in every night: so that it does not adhere and scar.
If, however, there is a blood flow, then place something pressed and dried over the area. If the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a mild cauterizing instrument, which is suitable for this: then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Head XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a toad's swelling, hindering the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it enlarges so much as to fill the mouth.
And the operation for this is, to open the patient's mouth in the sun and examine the abscess.
If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, and the patient does not feel it: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it inclines toward whiteness, in which there is moisture, then thrust a hook into it, and cut it with a sharp and thin knife, and free it from all sides. And if blood overcomes you at the time of your operation, then place pounded cumin seed on it until the blood is止于此。请继续您的指令。
And let it be washed with vinegar and salt: and care for the rest with the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Head XXXVI.
Sometimes gland-like swellings occur in the throat, which are called adenoids and develop in front of the tonsils. They are known as the two tonsils. When you treat them with what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider the case further.
If therefore it is an abscess that is hard, of a dark color, and has little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is of a red color and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, but rather leave it until it matures. And then either you will puncture it: or it will break by itself.
And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is thin: then you must cut it.
And the operation on it is this: you should consider before his operation whether the apostema is calm and completely healed by rest, or has diminished by some reduction. Therefore, make the sick sit in the sun, and let his head be in your bosom, and open his mouth, and let a servant take it between his hands, and press his tongue down with an instrument, the form of which is this.
Let it be made of silver or brass, and let it be thin like a small knife.
When therefore you press with it the tongue, and the apostema is revealed to you, and falls upon it by your weight: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and extract it toward the outside as far as you can, beyond which draw something from the tissue.
Then cut it with an instrument, the form of which is as follows. It is similar to tweezers; however, its ends are curved, such that the opening of each is acutely directed toward the other. Hence, take care that it is made of iron or soaked in alum.
If, however, this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spoon-shaped implement, the form of which is as follows. Let it be acute from one side, not acute from the other.
And after you have incised one tonsil, incise the other according to this same manner of incision.
Then after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If however there is a bleeding, the patient should gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled: or with myrtle leaves, and similar things among styptics, until the bleeding stops: then care for it until it is healed.
And sometimes abscesses form in the throat other than the two tonsils. Incise these accordingly as I said in the incision of the two tonsils evenly.
And indeed I myself healed a woman who had an abscess in her throat that was drawing towards the blackened state, with very few remaining senses, which was nearly closing off her throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow opening, and had already forbidden herself food and drink: and she would have reached death if she had survived one more day, or two days.
And the abscess had only ascended so much that it had released two branches, until they exited through two nasal openings.
I clamped them quickly and fixed one of the branches with a hook. Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nasal opening.
Then I did to him what proceeded from the other nostril孔隙.
Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue, and afterwards hooked the apostema with a hook, then cut out part of it, and it flowed from him only a little blood: thus the throat of the woman was cured, and she began to drink water immediately, then she took food.
Therefore I did not cease to cut from that apostema many times over a long time. And the apostema kept appearing in the place where I was cutting it until it became excessively large and with her.
I therefore devised a plan and cauterized the apostema between the throat.
Therefore, there was no addition of the condition: then I walked away, and did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ Incision of the apostema of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the uvula and becomes an apostema and is long, then it is called a perpendicular apostema. And if it is in the lower part thick and round, then it is called a uvula.
When it is cured with what we said in the division, and the cure does not persist, and you see that the hot apostema has subsided and become thin, then you should incise it.
And what is aggregated round from it, and does not have length, and is bloody or of a dark color or black, and has no sensation: then you should make an incision in it. In that there is fear for the sick.
Therefore you must, when you see it according to the mode as I said, from albedo and length, so that you make the sick person sit facing the sun: and press its tongue with the instrument whose description preceded: then fix a forceps in the tumor, and draw it downward: and cut it with one of the two instruments as I said for the incision of two tonsils.
And you must not cut from it, unless that which is added beyond the natural term without addition.
For if you cut from it more than is necessary, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use what we have narrated for the incision of two tonsils: and care for it until it is healed.
If the sick person is frightened by the incision, then you must use your skill in cauterizing it without fear and worry.
And the measure of cauterization in this is not appropriate unless with sharp water: and you must place the sick person's head in your lap. Then press its tongue with the instrument as we have said. Then take from the water as I said to you in the chapter on cauterizing, and make a hot paste from it, neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument with it, which has this form.
Place the concavity of the medicine at its extremity, as in the concavity of a spoon's bowl.
And place the instrument with the medicine over the ulcer itself: and let the patient lie on his side, so that the saliva from his mouth may run out of the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it to his throat and injure him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And let the patient have it over the ulcer for the quantity of half an hour, until you see it blackened and the bite soothed by the medicine.
And if you wish to apply coturnix and wrap it around the end of the radius, and pour coturnix with the medicine, and insert the radius with the coturnix into the tube from above, until the coturnix adheres over the ulcer.
Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you desire in the cauterization of the ulcer. Then release it: for it will char and fall off after three days, or four.
If you need to apply the medicine again, do so: and after cauterization, cleanse around the ulcer with a cloth soaked in butter, and wash it with whatever is around it from the medicine, using cold water.
And treat externally with lotions and internally with gargles until it is healed.
Therefore, this method of cure is more healthful than incision and farther removed from fear.
And sometimes the ulcer is treated even with something finer than cauterization and incision: it is treated with inhalation, according to this method. Take reed, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and safflower, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar ones from herbs: and aggregate all of these, or some of them in a pot, and be submerged with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be glazed with plaster sufficiently: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot upon which an concave instrument should be placed according to this manner.
Let it be made of silver or bronze: and insert the end, in which is the pomegranate, into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula above the tube, until the uvula darkens much.
Then apply it repeatedly many times until it cools.
And beware, that you do not perform this treatment at the onset of the approaching gangrene. For he adds it frequently in gangrene: and it is not proper for you to do so unless at the decline of its heat.
If however this instrument is not present for you, then take a cane, and wrap its end with oak bark: so that the patient's mouth is not burned: for the oak bark prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is for good treatment with safety.
¶ On the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Head XXXVIII.
Many times a bone, or fish spine, or something similar adheres in the throat.
Therefore, you must extract what is apparent on the surface upon which it has fallen after you press the tongue with an instrument at the solar plexus, and it becomes clear to you what is in the throat.
And that which is not apparent to you and is concealed in the throat, it is necessary for you to make the sick person vomit before food is digested in the stomach. For perhaps the attached matter will be expelled through vomiting.
Or the sick person shall swallow a fragment of a date, or the root of a lettuce, or shall swallow a piece of dry bread: or he shall receive a fragment of a dry sea sponge: and bind it in a thread, then swallow it. When therefore it arrives at the place where the spines or the os are, and is extracted, then it will be expelled.
If therefore it does not be expelled with what we have said, then use the instrument made of lead according to this form.
Let it be somewhat thicker than a radius, and at the end let there be a curve, which he inserts into his throat with ease: and he himself should hold his head raised upwards.
And let him be careful of the touch of his epiglottis, lest he cough and force open the mouth or the spine, and the physician insert it with his hand.
But what the sick person inserts is better because of his knowledge of the place of the attached matter: and he should push it downward, or draw his hand with the instrument upward, the entire thing according to the quantity prepared for him until it is expelled.
**On the Extraction of the Bloodsucker.**
Chapter XXXIX.
When the bloodsucker is treated as I said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not stick, then consider in the throat of the sick person before the sun, or near the sun after you press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
If therefore your patient falls on a leech, remove it with a small forceps, or with fine tweezers properly.
If it is not possible with them: then take a concave cannula and introduce it into the patient's throat nearly to the throat. Then introduce into the concavity of the cannula a burning iron with fire. Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from water all day.
Then let him take the treated leech fully immersed in cold water, and open his mouth in the water: and moisten his mouth with it, and let him not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another with his hand. For the leech, as soon as it feels water, falls off.
If it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with lice, or with an ear of grain using the instrument I described in the fumigation of the vine.
Do this many times, for it will fall off on its own.
And the method of operation in fumigation is as follows: take a pot containing live prunes with fire, and cover the pot with its lid, which has a hole in the middle. Arrange the end of the instrument in that hole.
Then project the fumigation, and let the patient place his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech. The leech will immediately fall off.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And if the patient tolerates thirst, let him eat salty food and garlic, and not drink water.
It is therefore necessary that he leave with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it falls there by chance.
It is similar to forceps, as you can see; except that it has this curvature which enters the throat. And its extremity is similar to the beak of a bird called ciconia, which has the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go entirely.
¶ Concerning the Incision of Fistulas, Their Section, and General Care.
Head XL.
The species of fistulas are many, of various kinds, according as the memory brings them to mind, namely one kind in this book: and they differ in their perforation and section by two methods.
One of which is from the species of fistula within itself, and because it grasps from the humors.
And the second method is due to the places where it occurs in the body.
Since a fistula occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the anus: and a fistula occurring in a fleshy place is different from one occurring at joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the procedure.
And from abscesses there are some which ought not to be punctured, unless after the maturation of sanious matter in them and its completion: and among these are some which ought to be punctured while they are raw and do not mature according to their completion.
As abscesses which are near joints.
Since an abscess, when it occurs near a joint and prolongs its existence until putrefaction sets in what is around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: whence it is a cause nearer to the contraction of that limb.
Or it is an abscess near the principal limb: for if you delay the puncturing of it until it matures, it will harm either him or through that limb the principal limb.
Or it is near the anus; therefore, puncture it while it is raw. And you ought not to puncture a raw abscess, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extends into the interior of the anus, thereby forming a fistula or remaining unhealed at its terminus.
You ought to know the time for puncturing an abscess when it has matured according to its completion: and this is indicated by the subsidence of pain, the recession of fever, and the diminution of redness, swelling, and headache from the abscess: and other signs.
And you ought to make the same puncture in the lower part of the abscess and in the more prominent area: and the puncture should be lengthwise if the abscesses are in parts of the hands and feet, and on the limbs, and on the tendons, and on the nerves and arteries, and finally in all places where there is no reflection.
In those which are reflected, go with perforation according to that member.
When indeed an apostema is in fleshy places: then it is better to let its perforation pass until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to completion.
For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus will be prolonged from it, and there will be much foulness and putrefaction, and perhaps its lips will become hard and deep.
And some apostemas are perforated according to the width of the body out of necessity: or according to that which the member needs.
And it must be that you administer in small apostemas a small perforation, and in large apostemas a large perforation: or many sections in similarity to the size of the apostema.
And there are apostemas in which it is necessary to concave the skin and cut when it has become like a piece of flesh, and has reached its limit, which is now dead: as happens in many cases, including buboes.
And there are some which are cut with a section having three angles. And there is one from which you cut as the figure of a myrtle leaf.
As in the case of an inguinal apostema.
And there are some in which a circular cut and a crescent cut are administered: and similar to these from cuts.
That indeed which does not have a head, as are mild superficial apostemas, must be perforated with a superficial perforation, or a flat one only.
And it must be, when the abscess is large and has already collected much脓液, that you puncture it so as not to delay and draw out all the pus at that hour: rather, draw from that part itself. Then incise the abscess until the following day. Then draw off some of the pus again.
Perform this multiple times according to the severity until it exits: especially if the patient is weak in constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small boy, or an old man in poor health: for the animal spirit is frequently dissipated with the exit of the foul matter; and perhaps the weak patient dies, and you do not notice.
Therefore beware in this chapter, a great caution.
And after your puncture of the abscesses, you must cleanse the wound: and consider. If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision flat, then administer licorice from linen, or old honey. And if the abscess is large and there are many punctures, then you must introduce licorice into every fissure until they come together.
And if you have excised a part of the skin in the abscess, or depressed it around the area: then you must fill it with old honey, or as when a cloth is woven, or combed with linen wool without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Then remove it and care for it with what is necessary from the ointment until it heals.
If however there happens to be a flow of blood during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar; after they are imbued with them, place the cloth many times on the place of the blood flow.
If however the flow of blood persists, then you must administer treatment and care, and the powders which I have described in many places of this our book, and by division.
If however it is in the time of winter, and the site of the abscess contains many nerves: then you must pour hot powders with wine and oil on them, and place them over the areas.
And if it is in the summer, and the areas are fleshy: then you must place powders imbued in water and oil, or him in wine and oil, and the whole thing cold. When the third day is come, as we have said, then you must drain the abscess and cleanse it, and administer in its care what suits him until it is healed.
This is therefore what is necessary to know for the universal cure of abscesses.
According to the division however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how the way to its cure can be achieved step by step individually.
Chapter XLII.
On the incision of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Small abscesses occur on the skin of the head, and they are of the kind called Nodora, which contain sac-like tunics: as if they were blisters.
And their species are many.
From them are the fatty: and from them are those that contain moisture like mud: and from them those that contain moisture like frosted and soupy substances: and similar to these, and from them are those that are stony and hard.
And in the section of all, there is no fear in their extraction, as it does not cause contradiction with their section.
And the operation in their section is, that you try it with an instrument whose form comes after these, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then dry it with the section according to its length, superficially: in this form.
And begin with the section from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then strip away the tissue which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything there entirely.
For it will return many times if something remains from it.
Then immerse it in Egyptian ointment if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it and leave it until another day. For it will corrode what remains from the tissue.
Then apply the tissue again with the second and third Egyptian ointment, and if needed, continue until you are sure that nothing remains from the tissue. Then care for the wound with ointment until it is healed.
If the abscess contains a soft knot: then incise it according to this form, with the cut having the shape of a cross: and throw hooks between the limbs of the cut, and strip it from every part: and try your strength in extracting the covering which contains it.
If the artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
And similarly do this in an abscess if it is stony, with the same incision and cure as we have said.
And the incision for an abscess that is stony is easier: for it has little blood and moisture. And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are on the head in some people, in which there is no moisture at all.
For example: I incised on an abscess on the head of an old woman, and found the abscess like a solid and hard, rough, white stone which could not be broken. And if someone struck it with force, it would wound itself.
In other abscesses on the head, aside from these abscesses that occur on children's heads and near the roots of the ears, their incision should be a superficial incision.
Or make a perforation in them always from the lower part, so that the flow of healing may proceed to the lower parts.
Then treat it with what is appropriate for them according to the cure.
¶ Concerning the incision of Stropharia on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These apostemas often occur in the neck, under the buttocks, and in the groin: sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And over those that occur from them in the neck, there is one, and many: they are generated from each other: and every Strophula arises within its own proper sheath, as in the nodes and apostemas of the head, as we have narrated.
And there are many species of Strophula. And from these there are the stony ones: and from these there are those that contain humors: and from these there are the malignant ones, which do not respond to treatment.
In that one which you see from them with a good disposition upon touch, whose color is close to the skin's color, and which moves to every part, and is not attached with the nerves of the neck, nor with the glands, nor with the artery, and is not deep: it must be excised by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line b. to the line g., and scrape it off from every part. Extend two flaps of skin with a forceps, or with multiple forceps if needed, as we said in the apostemas of the head, and gradually remove it.
And it is a precaution to ensure that no vein or nerve is injured.
And let the spatium be not very acute: so that it does not complicate your incision or disturb the patient, and cut what is not necessary.
If however you cut a vein, or an artery, or the operation is hindered, then apply pounded zegi or certain powders that coagulate blood, and compress the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the apostema subsides, and the wound softens: or begins to putrefy.
For blood is let a twelfth part of a pint. Therefore return to your operation when you have completed it.
Then inquire with thy index finger, if anything remains from Strophulis of small ones: therefore cut them and cleanse them.
For if there is a large vein in the root of Strophula: then thou must not cut that Strophula from its root: rather it must be ligated with a doubled strong thread, and let it go until it falls by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with the old cloth, which thou hast already immersed in Egyptian ointment. Then care for it.
If the entire Strophula is cut, then thou must join the two lips of the wound and apply it immediately, after thou seest that there is no longer any excess.
If, however, thou seest that there is still excess due to the size of the Strophula, then thou must turn to cutting its root and extracting it: and administer the suture as we have said.
And which contains humors from Strophula, puncture it with a superficial puncture: so that the place of its maturity may become apparent to thee: and place the puncture below what follows in the body, as we have said.
Then apply licorice with ointment and similar substances, so that it may consume what remains from putrefaction, until thou seest the wound already cleansed: then care for it with generative flesh ointment until it is healed.
Chapter XLIII.
On the incision of the Epiglottis from an abscess within the throat.
The ancients said that this incision of the epiglottis should be performed, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their words.
In cases of synanchia, it is necessary to perform the incision of the epiglottis: since no relief is obtained through that means; for all the veins and lung are weak.
In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to use the incision of the epiglottis to prevent the danger that arises from obstruction.
Therefore, when we wish to do this, we must incise the epiglottis under three rings of the epiglottis, or four, with a small section in width, at the place that is between two rings in quantity, so that the section is made in the sifac, not in the cartilage: and this very place is suitable for the incision, because it is free from flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the physician is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a forceps. Then find the skin until it reaches the canal: avoid the blood vessel if he sees anything from there.
Then incise the sifac as we have described: and it is indicated above the incision of the canal from the phlegm that emerges from there, together with what is ruptured and cut from the voice.
And let the wound open at some time.
And when therefore the hour is removed in which fear of scalding exists, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and itself alone without cartilage.
Then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow until it is cured.
Albucasis says. Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: vadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.
And that which I myself have seen is this: a servant girl received a knife and thrust it into her throat, and it pierced a part of the canal of her lung.
And I was called to cure her, and I found her bellowing, as is the bellow of the dead.
I therefore examined the wound and found blood that had emerged from the wound. I therefore concluded that she had not severed the vein or the gue Sage (vein): and air was escaping from the wound.
Therefore I have treated it properly, both the wound and its care, until it is healed: and nothing happened to the maid except a hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better state of condition.
Therefore I say: that there is no danger in the incision of the Epiglottis.
¶ On the Incision for Goiter.
Chapter XLIV.
This is called an apostema of the throat, and it is a large apostema according to the color of the body, and it occurs frequently in women.
And it is according to two modes: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In the natural case, certainly there is no skill required.
Accidental, however, is according to two modes: of which one is similar to fatty knots. And the other mode is similar to an apostema that results from the concretion of an artery. And there is danger in it, and it is not appropriate to apply the iron to it unless it is a small area. And you should probe it and investigate it with the introducer. Therefore, if you find it similar to a fatty knot and it is not suspended with any vein, then cut it out as knots are cut. Remove it along with whatever it contains from the cyst if it is in a cyst; otherwise, thoroughly examine the entire area. Then care for the site with what is necessary from the treatment until it is healed.
Head XLV.
On Section Concerning the Species of Knots.
Many species of knots exist, and I have already described all their species in the division. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a Knot and an Exit: which creates doubt.
I say that when an exit is heat, fever, and severe pains, until the eruption of excess is stabilized and the corruption is completed: for then the fever and heat will cease.
But with a Knot there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them in cysts sifachin, which is their own sack, and it is according to the color of the body: and their beginning is like chickpeas, and it becomes like a sieve, and greater and lesser.
And they are of two species: either fatty: or contain moisture. And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a Knot, you must examine it and inquire about it first with an instrument called Intromissum, according to its form as described in the chapter that follows.
And the method of inquiry for abscesses and all Knots is this: you must take this instrument, and introduce it into the more humid place, which you find in the abscess. And you should slowly rotate your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin. Then, with your hand last, according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Then extract what has been inserted, and observe what comes out in its place.
If therefore moisture flows out, of whatever color it may be: then dry it with a superficial incision, as I said in the cases of other ulcers.
And if no moisture comes out in the place of what was inserted, then know that it is fatty: therefore dry it with a superficial incision having the form of a cross, as I have shown you: and suspend it with hooks, and strip the skin from every part with facility: and guard the chest if possible over it, that you may extract the healthy one with the Knot.
And if the chest is ruptured during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy one, for this often happens, then extract it bit by bit until nothing remains of it.
For if anything remains from it, whether little or much, the Knot returns according to the greatest extent.
And if it overcomes you and something remains from it little: then fill the wound at the end of your operation with some corrosive sharp powders: and tighten the wound, and place above what is set there a hot poultice, and care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And if the Knot is large, then treat its two lips, and care for it along with what grows flesh.
And if you have a contrary vein, whether pulsatile or not: then act quickly, and fill the place where I have pointed with pounded garlic, and leave it bound for two days, or three, until the wound putrifies and the ebullition of blood subsides: then return to incising what remains of the Knot.
Head XLVI.
Of instruments from outside for cutting and piercing.
These are the forms of Intromissorum, and they are of three species.
From these, there is the large one, and from these, there is the medium one, and from these, there is the small one.
Let them be made of iron, with the corners of the square cut off, so that the insertion into the aposteme may be quicker.
And these are the forms of Perforantia, and no, that is, perforating: and one of them is called beris, that is, perforating: and they are of three species.
From these, there is the large one, and the medium one, and the small one.
They are suited to investigate apostema, exiturae, and bubones from what is between them in the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and soft, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, made of yellow stuff, or of copper, or of iron, or of silver.
And the better ones are those made of yellow stuff.
And they are also made of black lead, which are suited for investigating fistulas, whose concavity causes reflections, so that they may be reflected with their gentle reflections.
And they are again of three species. For from these there are the long ones, and from these the medium ones, and from these the short ones, according to the width and stricture of the fistula.
Forma Vinconorum, et sunt multarum species.
Since they are simples, namely those which have but one virtue: and they are of three species as you see, Magni, Medii, and Parui.
And from these are the blind Vinca: and they are of three species.
And from these are the Vinca having two virtues, and they are of three species: and from these are the Vinca having three virtues, and they are of three species: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of Scalpels, with which nodules and apostemes are cut and excoriated: and they are of three species: for there is the large, the medium, and the small.
Their extremities with which the section is made are acute, while other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed thus unless it be to make assistance in excoriating nodules out of fear of incising a vein or nerve: and so that the sick may be healed by them and find some tranquility from the burning he finds during the excoriation of an apostema.
They are made of bronze and are similar to the rod with which alcohol is made. In their extremity, a hole for the Spatillumis is hidden: and it runs to the interior and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magni, mediui, et parvi.
Forms of Wind Diseases in which the blood flow is cut off: and they are of three kinds, great, medium, and small.
Let them be round, like in length as you see: and let them be fine.
And let these species of Wind Diseases be great and small with you: so that you may cut off the blood quickly when necessary, and then when medical help is not present.
However, you shall not use them for the cutting off of blood in every part of the body, but only in fleshy places: such as the thighs, the hips, the forearms, the breasts, the abdomen, the groin, and similar fleshy parts.
And sometimes they are made into small similar instruments from the thongs of gloves, according to their shape: with which the blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
Chapter XLVII.
¶ Concerning the Care of Breasts in Men Which Are Similar to Women's Breasts.
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell during sleep (that is, when they begin to wet the bed) until they resemble women's breasts: and they remain foul sore ulcers.
Therefore, whoever wishes to avoid this, should cut with a lunar blade along the line from b to g over the breasts. Then scrape off all the fatty tissue completely. Then fill the wound with flesh-renewing medicine. Then join the two edges of the wound with stitches, and care for it until it heals.
If the nipple declines to the lower parts and softens because of its size, as happens in women: then it must be incised on its two upper sides with two similar semicircular sections, each of which is contained with the other at the ends until a larger line contains a smaller one, according to this form from line b. to line g. Afterwards, scrape the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and administer what we said about stitching and powders, which is necessary for care, until it heals.
If, however, you do not close the incision that you are to make, because of the patient's restlessness or due to blood flow: then fill the wound with a poultice submerged in corrosive ointment, and leave it until the remaining fat is corroded. Then care for it until it heals.
¶ Concerning the perforation of an abscess that occurs beneath the subcutaneous tissue.
Head XXIV.
These abscesses that occur beneath the subcutaneous tissue are of the species of Stropharia, some containing cysts, and others containing humidities.
Those that contain humidities should be incised with a semicircular section, according to this form, from line b. to line g. When all the pus is evacuated from the abscess, then fill it with an old poultice and leave it for another day.
Then the pus shall be removed, and it shall be treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the species of Strophylae nodules, then incise above it, as we said in the section on equally divided Strophylae.
If the wound extends such that it discharges pus, then apply cauterization to it, as we said in what was previously mentioned.
Head XXLIX.
¶ Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs due to the Artery and Vein.
When the artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, abscesses often occur: similarly, this also happens with veins, causing abscesses and inflammation.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and inflammation are due to the artery and vein are as follows: for when an abscess is due to the artery, it is long and situated deep in the body. And when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there were a hissing sound within it.
And that which is due to the vein is round and evident on the surface of the body.
And the incision for this abscess is an error, and particularly when it is located under the armpits, groin, and neck, and in many other parts of the body: it is very significant. Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and what is also recommended at the extremities or on the head should be avoided.
Therefore, concerning that which arises from the inflation of the arterial orifice, incise in the skin at the section in length. Then make the incision with forceps, then the artery: and free it from the tunics until they are exposed.
Then introduce the needle under it and make it penetrate until the other side, and secure the artery with a double thread at two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Then puncture the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula, until all the blood therein flows out, and the abscess is dissolved.
Then administer the treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall away: thereafter, treat it with ointments suitable for it until it is healed.
If it is an abscess due to the cutting of the vein, then you must hold with your hand as much as possible from the abscess including the skin. Then introduce the needle under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: place a double thread in it until you extract it from the other side. Then tie the abscess with a good ligature: as I have instructed you for the ligature of the vein, using a thread with two parts and two extremities.
If you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then introduce another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision site. Press it, and secure your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in its middle until what is in it emerges; then cut the excess skin, and release what has been ligatured from it.
Then place upon it a poultice which has subsisted in wine and oil. Then administer the cure, which is done with licorices and ointments, until it is healed.
Head L.
¶ Of the abscess that occurs from the torsion of nerves.
As an abscess occurs in Arteria and Vena, similarly an abscess occurs in Nerves: what occurs to them is a blow, or it occurs from excessive labor, and similar causes: and they are most affected in places of assistance, or the calcaneus, and in every place where joints move: and it is a heavy abscess.
Its color resembles that of the rest of the body, and it is often disposed without pain: and when strained with frenzy, the sick person feels it similar to a state of stupor.
And it is not an aggregated abscess within the deep parts of the body, but it is beneath the skin, and moves to every part, and does not go forward or in front, nor backward behind.
Therefore, what is from them in joints should not be invaded with iron. For it may happen that there will be contraction.
For that which is from them in the head, or on the forehead, incise the skin with a spatula. If therefore an abscess is small, then hold it with forceps and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it: then remove it, and suture the wound: and care for it until it is healed.
Head VI.
¶ Of the incision of an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Sometimes fungi, which they call Fungalia, occur in their abdomens and in other parts of their bodies, resembling them in appearance.
Of which the root is fine, and their head is large, and the lips turn around. And it is small from them: and there is something from them that grows very large.
And I myself have indeed seen a man, and in his abdomen were two fungi, which were more similar to other things than to fungi: there was no difference between them, white, with fine roots, and their lips turned around, and they were found, and a moisture always flowed from them.
I cut into them and found one to weigh about 18 ounces and the other about 6 ounces. The operation in cutting them is this: consider then, if the patient is moist, and the color of the fungi is white, moist, with fine roots: then cut it with a broad spoon, and have cauterization ready in fire.
For much blood is often expelled during its incision: so if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
If you see a patient frightened and timid from incision with iron, then take a thread made properly of lead, and tie it with him athelul: the measure of which is what we said, and let him go for two days.
Then add to the tying of lead. Therefore do not cease to tie the lead until it is applied properly, and then let it fall off by itself without effort.
If the thlil be thick, there is some fear and weakness in the incision, especially in the belly.
Yet it is possible to incise the middle of it. Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then care for it until the wound heals.
And beware not to assume that thlil of a dark color, with few sensations, and a foul appearance, is diseased tissue: for it is a malignant tumor. And I shall relate the case of Cancer after this.
Head 52.
¶ Concerning the care of the prominence of the navel.
The prominence of the navel arises from many causes. Or from fissures near the abdomen, and what comes out is althub, or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures. Or from blood that flows from the vein, or from the artery, according to what has been previously stated. Aut ex ventilatione compressa in eo.
If, however, it is because of a fissure and the exit of thrombus: then its color is similar to the color of the body, and it is soft, without pain, and appears to have a different location. And if it is because of the passage of intestinal matter, then its location is more marked than what we have described. When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it magnifies much at the entrance of the bath, and causes great pain.
If, however, it is because of humidity, it is soft; then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is there any constriction or addition.
If it is because of the blood, then it appears as an apostema tending to blackness from the edge.
If, however, it is because of flesh grown there: then it is an apostema that is heavy, large, hard, and takes the shape of a lump.
If, however, it is because of windiness, then its touch is soft.
And the treatment for this is such that you should consider whether the prominence of the navel is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or windiness: then you must refrain from treating it. For there is fear and dread in this, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke of apostemas caused by arteries and veins.
If the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine, or the zirbum: then you should order the patient to hold his breath and stand stretched out. Then mark with cauterization around the circumference of the navel entirely. Then order him to be laid on his back with his hands under his head. Then spread the wide lintel around the circumference of the navel over the place you marked with cauterization. Then extend the middle bandage to the upper part, using a large pin. Then bind it around strongly with a thread, or with a silk ligature: and let the knot of the ligature be alexithymia.
Then open the extended middle bandage above the ligature. If therefore you are able to grasp it already captured by the ligature: then extract alexithymia, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine toward the interior of the abdomen: and if you find zirbum, then take it with a pin, and cut its excess.
If, however, it is an artery or vein: then mark it around greatly. Then return to your operation. And take two needles, and insert two strong threads into them: and insert two needles around the circle you made around the bandage in the form of a cross, making them penetrate.
Then stitch the bandage in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the space until the flesh decomposes and falls off by itself: or cut it when it is reduced and decomposed.
Then care for it with what is necessary from ointments until it is cured.
If the protrusion of the navel is from flesh growing therein, or from moisture: then it should be incised to form a recess, as we have said. And draw out the blood or moisture that you find therein.
Then care for it with what will harden the area.
Head III.
¶ Concerning the care of CANCER.
We have already discussed the division of the species of cancer, and how to approach its cure with medicines: and we have cautioned against using iron in its treatment to avoid ulceration. We have also spoken of cancer generated in the womb and the precautions in its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its removal is possible: just as cancer in the breasts, or in the thigh, and similar places, from members located for the extraction of the whole thing: especially when it is beginning and small.
When, however, it hardens and becomes large, you should not approach it closely.
For I was unable to cure anyone from it: nor have I seen anyone before me who has survived it.
And the operation when it is located as we have said, is to precede and relieve the sick area with black bile several times. Then perform phlebotomy if you find it with clear engorgement.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he will be placed during the operation.
Then project into the cancer hooks that suit it. Then concave it from every part with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains from the roots thereof: and let the blood run, and do not cut it quickly, but rather express the places, and cleanse all gross blood with your hand, or with what is possible there with instruments.
If, however, the blood flows excessively from the incision of an artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops. Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ Of the Care of Hydroosis.
Head IV. We have already described the divisions of Hydroosis and how the aggregation of water occurs in each case. We have also mentioned the signs of each species and the treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is none other than the species of ascites alone; and iron should not be applied to the species of tympanites or to the species of hypoastracum, for that is fatal.
When you have treated this species of Hydroosis (tympanites) with medicines and the treatment has not been effective, then consider. For if the patient has already suffered weakness, or there is another illness in addition to Hydroosis (such as coughing, or bowel release), then be careful not to treat him with iron, for that is dangerous.
If you see an ill person exhibiting excess of strength, and there is no ailment except Hydropisis: and neither a youth nor an old man, then the measure of operation in such a case is that you raise the ill person standing between your hands, and the attendant behind him express his abdomen by pushing water to the lower part with the back of his hand.
Then take thorn探查者，这里是“刺刀”还是“荆棘”更为合适？ Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with acute extremities like a spatule. But let there be something of shortness gradually, so that you do not pass through it during the operation to the intestine and wound it.
Then consider. For if the generation of Hydropisis is from the part of the intestines, then you must lengthen the incision from the navel by three fingers' breadth, downward directly above the ribs.
If, however, the generation of Hydropisis is due to an ailment of the liver: then your incision should be on the left side from the navel by three fingers' breadth.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side: and it is not advisable for the incision to be on the side on which the ill person wishes to lie, so that excessive fluids do not flow to that weak place.
Then puncture the entire skin with the instrument. Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatule between the skin, and scrape as if you were scrubbing it off. The amount to be scraped should be about the size of a nail or approximately that.
Then puncture the sinus until the spatula reaches the vacuum place: and it is the place of water. Then extract it, and introduce into the opening an instrument, the form of which is as follows. And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or brass, or golden brass, and should be soft and polished. At the lower part of it, there is a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two from one side and one from the other side. Its end is incised according to the manner of an incised reed, as you see. At its upper end, there is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends above the instrument, therefore evacuates from the water a medium quantity in an hour.
For if you evacuate from it more than is required, perhaps the sick person will die in an hour from the resolution of his own vital spirits: or it may happen to him a fainting that approaches death.
Indeed, evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to how the disposition of the sick person is indicated to you by the strength and goodness of his pulse.
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Because it is retained immediately due to the skin which retains the opening that is above the sinus: about which I have spoken, so that you puncture it according to this manner.
Then repeat the procedure with the instrument on the following day, if you see the sick person tolerate it: and extract from the water a small quantity.
Perform this for some days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains in the water only a little.
If, however, you fear for the sick person and let much sediment remain in the water: then take care of it with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in a bath and sun, and let it wait on thirst: and care for it with drying medicines until it is cured: and cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen after the extraction of the water: according to what I have described in what preceded.
Of the care of infants born in places where their urine passages are not perforated.
Head LV.
When some infants emerge from their mother's womb, and the headmutinus' aperture is not perforated, or the aperture is narrow, or in an improper place.
Therefore, it must be aided with the perforation of its aperture immediately upon birth using a Spatulimi subtile valde, according to this form.
Then place a fine nail made of lead in the aperture and ligate it. Hold it for three days, or four.
When therefore it wishes to emit urine, remove the nail and mix it. Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine, which flows over the place, will prevent it from being closed.
That one whose aperture is narrow is treated with lead, as we have said, over many days until it is enlarged.
Those, however, in which there is a hole in an improper place, are injured. Which is because, among those who are born, the hole is at the end of the spinal column: whence it cannot enter anteriorly until he raises the spinal column with his hand to the upper parts. Neither is there generation for this reason, namely, that the sperm cannot reach the uterus in a straight manner; and it is a very foul sickness.
And the method of operation in this case is to have the patient lie face downward on his back. Then extend the head of the spinal column with your left hand by a vigorous stretch, and cut the head of the spinal column from the glans, using a sharp needle or a sharp spoon-shaped tool: just as you would cut a reed, or as you might scrape something, so that its middle becomes similar to the head of the spinal column: and let the hole fall in the middle, according to what is required.
And beware to you during your operation from the flow of blood. For it happens often. Therefore oppose it with what cuts the blood, and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ Concerning the ailments of the foreskin and head of the penis, as well as corrosion, blackening, and adherences.
Chapter LVII.
These ailments often occur in the spinal column, and there is an prominence of foul flesh.
And from it there is a malignant one, and another that is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one ought to be suspended with a fine hook and cut it off until you cleanse it entirely. Then place it under the wound submerged in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it itself with dyafinicon ointment until it is cured.
If it is the malign Albather with a foul color, then you ought to apply cauterization after incising it and give its reason.
If, however, the Albather is within the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of it is inside the foreskin, and part outside: then you ought to remove the Albather that is inside first, until it is consolidated, then treat what is outside: for when you treat it together, the foreskin may split.
And even in the testicles, and the foreskin may become blackened and corrupted. Therefore, you ought to cauterize the entire part that is already blackened, and what wants to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Then apply a line over it after that with honey that is already mixed with flour of grain kernels and sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is cured.
If, however, there is bleeding, then apply cauterization with the lunar caustic in this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuvaluinium ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.
Quod si corroditur caput virgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatus priapi cannulam ex plumbō, ut mitiget infirmus super eam.
In adhaerentia praeputii cum capite virgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter vulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput virgae ab omni parte.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite virgae, et ex praeputio. Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam velociter.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput virgae cum panno linī subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.
Deinde curetur cum vino stiptico, donec consolidetur.
Caput LVII.
¶ Demundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, as are other wounds; yet since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is proper for boys, it is necessary that we signify in it an operation better and a way leading more gently to health.
I say, however, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: for they do not use it in their laws, and it is merely what we have acquired through experience.
Because I found the greater part of artists and phlebotomists use ablution, cutting with scissors, and using forceps: they also employ cauterization, ligature with thread, and incision with a knife.
And I have indeed tested all these methods and did not find one better than incision with forceps and ligature with thread for ablution.
Because in ablution using scissors, the skin often gets torn. Because the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore, perhaps the upper layer is torn, while the lower layer remains intact. This necessitates an incision to reach and treat the other layer, which will also cause future pain. And with the ablution performed through cauterization, which is done digitally, as dressers use it, the incision at the extremity of the male member is not secured: for it may enter the opening of its own.
In ablution using a knife, the iron might slip out and ruin your operation: and indeed, the nature of a boy's skin is brief, and often they are born such that they do not need ablution: and I have seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius. Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem virgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua. Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae. Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo. Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum. Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta. Deinde eleva cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput virgae. Deinde dimittes sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est vitellus oxyde coctus in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo rosae recenti bono: et dimittes eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus clavis: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae. For it will not harm him.
Therefore treat it with what we have described in the treatise on powders to consolidate wounds. And if it flows from the skin beyond measure and escapes to the upper parts, it will not harm him even.
Therefore treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter LVIII.
¶ Concerning the Extraction of Retained Vesicaria.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from powder made from a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh grown from it, and similar substances as we have mentioned in the methods of cure in division.
And if the urine is not relieved, and you see that the retention is due to a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary to treat the sick person with a curved instrument placed on his knees. Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he should stretch his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and the sick person should breathe deeply as much as possible. Therefore it is pressed against the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone, which is why the urine is relieved.
And if it is not relieved even with what we have said, and the matter becomes urgent for the sick person: then you must administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be made of silver, and be fine, soft, concave like the radius of a bird's feather in fineness, long in the likeness of the palm of one and a half fingers: it should have a fine tube at its head.
And the mode of exit of Vrina through it is this: take a doubled thread, and bind at its extremity wool or cotton, a good ligature; and insert the extremity of the thread into the inferior part of the Syringe: and cut with pincers if anything surplus from the wool remains, but insert in the cannula with eagerness, as alzer.
Then anoint the Syringe with oil or butter and aloë: and cause the patient to sit on a seat, and embrocate the blister, and its stick with oily substances and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert the Syringe into the stick with facility until it reaches the root of the vein.
Then double it upwards from the part of the navel.
Then push the Syringe into it until it reaches the blister, and let the patient feel that he has now reached the empty place: and this does not happen in this order unless because the passage in which it goes is tortuous.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually. For Vrina will follow the wool.
Then withdraw it, and let Vrina flow through the urine passage: and repeat the Syringe, and do not cease to perform this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
¶ Of the quality of clisterization of the bladder with Clepsydra.
Head 59.
When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals or is coagulated in it, and there is pus that needs to distill into it with water and medicines: then use the instrument called Clepsydra, and this is its form.
For it is deaf, that is, closed. And there are three foramina in it, two on one side and one on the other, as you can see.
And the concave place, in which that which is pressed upon it is situated, should be such that when it expels without addition according to its quantity, and when drawn with it something is drawn by humidity, and when pressed, it is expelled to a distance: just as the clepsydra works, by which naptha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in battles of Mars.
When therefore you wish to project the humors into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the humor, and draw with it what is pressed upon it to the upper part, for the humor is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Then insert the end of it into the rod, as we have described for the syringe. Then press the humor with what is pressed upon it; for the humidity will immediately reach the bladder, so that the patient feels it.
The form of the catheter is thin, through which the bladder is filled.
Let it be made of silver or bronze: whose head should be slightly higher and similar to a small camel's hump, and beneath it a sinus in which a ligament may fall.
Then take the goat's bladder and put into it humor through which you wish to fill the bladder with the catheter. Then tie it between the two sinuses with a strong ligature using double thread, and warm the humor slightly over fire.
Then insert the end of the catheter into the stick, afterwards grip your hand over the bladder with a suitable tightening of moisture, until the patient feels that this moisture has reached the bladder.
If however there is no bladder present for you, then take a fragment of parchment, and make from it a circle, and pierce it entirely round its circular shape. Then insert the thread forcefully into these openings, as they are turned. Then aggregate the circle, as an affractus is aggregated: after you place on it what you wish from moisture, oils, and waters.
Then ligate it on the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder when expressed by hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Head LX.
¶ Extraction of the Stone.
We have already discussed the division of the species of the Stone and its cure with medicines: I have also described the difference between the Stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of the whole condition: and I have spoken of the Stone where the operation is performed by hand and cutting: and there is the Stone generated properly in the bladder: and that which is fixed on a stick: and I am narrating this with a clear and abbreviated exposition.
I say, therefore, that the Stone generated in the bladder occurs most frequently in children.
And from its signs, the urine that is discharged from the bladder is similar to water in its fineness: and white sand is apparent in it, and the patient rubs his stick and labors with it, and often hangs or dangles. Then it is elevated, and they exit with it from many of them.
And the cure is easy for children as long as they are under fourteen years of age. And it is difficult in the elderly. In youth, it is moderate, depending on the condition: and for those whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if small, the treatment is otherwise.
When we arrive at the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with a purge using a calix, which expels all the feces in his intestines: for sometimes it impedes the discovery of the stone during examination.
Then the patient is to be taken with his feet elevated, and shaken, and moved towards the lower parts: so that the stone may descend into the depths of the bladder, or it may rise from a high place several times.
Then cause him to sit between your prepared hands, and his feet should be under his own thighs, so that the bladder may become completely inclined towards the lower parts.
Then examine him, and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel the stone in the space, then hasten immediately with the knife above it.
If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if the patient is a completed youth, and insert it into his anus, and examine for the stone until it stands beneath your finger: and turn it gradually towards the bladder neck.
Then press upon it with your finger and push it towards the exterior against the place whose section you wish to make: and command one assistant to press on the bladder with his hand, and command another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with the other hand, remove the skin which is beneath the testicles in the part from the place where the section is.
Then introduce the Spatium incidencei, whose form is this. And cut into what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the left side of the birth canal: and let the section be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the section be transverse, so that the external part is wide, and the internal part narrow, according to the quantity such that the exit of the stone from there is not greater.
For perhaps the finger in the anus compresses the stone at the section, and it exits without difficulty.
And know that for the stone which has angles and margins, the exit is difficult on account of this.
And from this it is soft, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy.
Therefore, for one that has angles and margins, add to the incision.
And if it does not exit thus, then you must probe above it: or tie a ligature above it with a gestus decenter, whose extremity is like the Moon, which will tie around the stone and not be expelled from it: or introduce under it a thin instrument with a curved extremity.
And if you cannot above it, then enlarge the opening slightly. If anything overcomes you from blood, cut it off with zegi.
If indeed there is more than one stone, then thrust first the largest one into the opening of the bladder. Then cut above it. Afterwards thrust the smaller one after it: and similarly do if there are more than two.
If the stone is very large, then it is ignorance to cut above it with a great incision. Since one of the two things happens to the sick person, either he dies, or there is an excessive discharge of urine: for because the place does not harden completely.
Truly, administer the expulsion of it until it exits: or use ingenuity in breaking it with forceps until you extract it piece by piece.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with balsam and aloes and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine or rose oil and cold water: that the hot abscess be cooled.
Then raise the sick person's head over its neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day. When therefore you release it, apply camphor to the area with water and much oil.
Then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
If indeed a hot abscess forms in the wound and becomes ulcerated, give similar treatments: just as if the blood congeals in the bladder and prevents urine from being excreted, which is recognized by the discharge of blood with the urine. Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood. For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar and water, and salt: and apply whatever species is appropriate from the cure until it is healed.
And it is necessary for the duration of the cure to bind two thighs and unite them, caused by the medicines placed over the area.
If the stone is small and is in the head of the urethra, and is fixed there, blocking the passage of urine: then treat it with what I describe before you reach the operation. For you will often be excused from performing the operation through this treatment, for I have already tested it.
And take the Perforator made of iron, whose form is triangular at the extremity, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread and tie it with a rod so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the perforating iron into the rod with ease until the Perforator reaches the stone: and turn the Perforator slowly in the stone with your hand: and ensure the perforation, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
For urine is then immediately relieved.
Then press your hand over what remains of the stone from the external part of the urethra. For it is broken and comes out with urine, and the sick man is cured.
If, however, this cure is not prepared for you, because of something that prohibits it from him: then tie the thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then dry above the stone on the same rod between two ligatures. Then extract it. Then undo the ligature and clean the congealed blood, which forms in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone, except that it does not return to the bladder: and another ligature above, except that when the thread is undone after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and because of this, you must tie the thread above when you tie it, so that you lift the skin to the upper parts, that it may return in its completion and cover the wound, as we have said.
Head 61.
§ On the Extraction of Stones from Women.
Stones are not commonly generated in women.
If, however, a stone happens to occur in one of them, then the cure is difficult and is prohibited because of many difficulties.
Their vein is: that the woman perhaps is a virgin.
And the second reason is because you will not find a woman who can detect herself when she is chaste or among those who have husbands.
The third reason is because you cannot find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth reason is the distance from the stone: wherefore deep section is needed, and there is fear in that.
Since necessity prompts you to do this, then you must take a female physician who is well knowing it: and such are not easily found.
If you are deprived of that, then seek a chaste, subtle physician, and present a female midwife well educated in women's affairs, or a woman who appears to have knowledge of this art: make her present, and especially for her, let her do all that you instruct her from the inquiry about the stone.
First, that she should observe whether the woman is a virgin: then she must introduce a finger into her anus and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she must constrict it with her finger, and then direct the obstetrician to introduce his finger into the patient's vagina and inquire about the stone, after placing his left hand on the bladder and pressing it with good compression.
If therefore she finds the stone, then she must gradually move it from the urethral opening toward the lower parts with great skill until it reaches the base of the thigh.
Then she must cut above it at the opposite side of the midpoint of the vagina at the base of the thigh, from whichever part it is prepared for her and she feels the stone: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, constricting beneath it: and let the incision be small first. Then insert the ray over that section.
Then insert the ray over that section. If therefore it feels the stone, then add to that section according to a proportionate quantity what the stone exits from it.
And know that there are many species of stones. From these, there is the small and the large, the soft and the rough, the long, and the round with branches.
Therefore know its species, so that it may be signified to you through this regarding what you wish.
If therefore the blood overcomes you, then add in the place spoken of ground black mustard seed, and hold it for one hour until the blood is discharged.
Then return to your operation until the stone exits. And make sure you prepare with your instruments as I said in the extraction of stones in males, so that you may assist through these in your operation.
If therefore the blood flow overcomes you, and you know that the discharge of blood is from the artery that was incised: then place powder at that location, and compress it with a suitable ligature: and do not change that; and let go of the stone, and do not pull it. For the sick woman might die. Then care for the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood is quieted after a few days, and the area putsrefies, then return to your operation until the stone exits.
Chapter LXII.
§ On the section for hydrocele.
Watery discharge is not present unless there is an aggregation of humidity in the white phyma, which is beneath the skin of the scrotum containing the testicles: and it is called phyma.
And sometimes it is within its own pannicle, which nature prepared for it in the part of the testicle, until it is putrefied: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white phyma, which we have said, and it does not occur except rarely.
And the generation of this in the testicles is due to weakness that occurs in them: whence this material is discharged to them. And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
And this humidity has many colors. For its color is either yellowish, or blood-red, or foul and black, or watery white, and that is the one that predominates.
And the signs by which the aggregation of water is known are these. For if it is in the white phyma which we have said, then the abscess is round about as long as the figure of the egg: and the testicle does not appear because the humidity contains it from every side.
And if the humidity is within its own pannicle, then the abscess is round with a part resembling an egg, and for this reason the man suspects that it is another egg.
And if the humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white phyma, then it becomes perceivable.
When therefore you wish to know the color of the humidity, then test the color of the humidity in the aposteme with the Inserted square, whose form preceded. According to that which issues from the trace of the Inserted, judge of that which is between it.
When therefore we come to treatment with a knife, then it must be that you first examine the patient, whether phlebotomy can be done for him, and you see his body full.
Then it is turned upside down over its back on a high stool, and place many cloths beneath it.
Then sit you on its left side, and command your assistant to seat himself on its right side, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the scrotum, and to the part of the flank.
Then take a broad spatula and dry the skin of the scrotum lengthwise from the middle, nearly to the groin: and let the cut be made straight according to the distance of the line which divides the scrotal skin, until it reaches the white part comprehending: and strip it off and observe, or beware in stripping it, that you do not cut it: and let your incision be on the side which hangs more than when suspended with an egg: and carefully examine it along with the stripping according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Then puncture the white part full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Then separate with forceps the part of the incision between the two labia, and extend the white part to the upper side, and do not touch the skin enclosing the scrotum: and cut the white part in whatever way is possible for you to cut it, either wholly or fragmentarily, especially the fine side. For if thou dost not thoroughly examine, in incising there is no security that water will not return.
If the egg proceeds outward from its skin during your operative hour: then when thou hast completed the incision thus, reduce it. Then join the two skin lips of the testicle with suture.
Then care for it as for other wounds until it heals.
If you find an egg corrupted by black mold, then you must ligate the vessels which are suspensory, fearing a flow of blood.
Then incise the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and extract the egg: thereafter care for it as we have said.
If indeed water is aggregated in two parts, then know that there are two branches: dry the other part equally as you did the other.
And if you find it appropriate that the operation be one, then do so: thereafter wipe away the blood. And insert into the incisions wool浸没在橄榄油中，或者浸入玫瑰橄榄油：然后在外放置另一块羊毛，之前浸在酒和橄榄油中，并将其展开覆盖在两个睾丸和小腹部上：再上面放两层布，这些是辅垫：然后用带有六股的线将它们绑起来。
Then take two pieces of cloth, soak them, and fill with medicated wool according to this likeness: and make ends by which they are pressed from below or with wet wool: and join these ends to the stricture in the loincloth: and one end may receive from above down to the back, and the second may receive toward the pectoral area: and two ends over the two lower thighs, and two other ends over the two inguinal areas, and join the entire stricture to the loincloth.
And, when artificially treated, this branch is cut with a cautery in place of the section using iron: and it is such that you should take a sharp surgical cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is ignited, as we have narrated, until when the white substance containing water is revealed: then take the cautery according to this form.
The Greek letter is assimilated.
Then perforate with it that white substance, and let it be ignited until all the moisture has escaped.
Then extend the white substance with forceps, and scrape it with a sharp ignited cautery, and cut it as much as possible for you, until you eradicate all of it.
And be careful with the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and farther from blood loss, and better than the operation with sectioning.
If, however, it causes you a contrary effect at the hour of sectioning, or at the hour of cautery, such as a hot abscess, or blood loss, or something else: then you must treat the contrary effect caused by it with the appropriate cure, according to what has been previously stated.
If the patient is timid and does not expect this operation due to its horror: then administer the perforation as I have described it.
When it is confirmed to you through what we have said about the signs that the branch is watery: then it must be that you make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then pierce the abscess at the lower part of it with a spatule of broad width: and place the puncture according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water runs out.
Then place over the wound, and ligate it, and let it be until the remaining water runs out: then care for it until the wound is healed.
If, however, there is a contrariety to the egress of water at the hour when you pierce it: and this is so only because the white membrane causes contrariety at the wound's opening, and prevents the exit of water: then you must introduce a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of dropsy is extracted, whose form preceded this: or add somewhat in the operation of the wound.
And know that the water returns and accumulates about six months after, or about that time. When therefore it accumulates, then it should be treated according to the same method, and the sick will pass his days.
Head LXIII.
On the care of Ramicis carnosa.
Know that in the section on this Ramicis, there is a danger of pernicious effects arising from a weakening fear in many dispositions. Therefore, I believe its removal to be beneficial from this.
And I recall the operation performed on it and the appearance of the abscess.
I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed, and this happens for many reasons, namely.
From acute excess or severe flux that flows to the testicles. From percussion.
And it is the color of an abscess according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a heavy abscess.
And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark, and no sensation is found in it.
And sometimes it happens from the nodulation of the arteries and their inflation: as its previous mention has already indicated; or from the inflation of the veins.
What therefore is from them, from the inflation of the arteries, is recognized by the arrangement of the abscess when you compress it with your fingers. And you should not touch it entirely.
That which happens from the inflation of the veins, does not disperse when compressed with fingers.
And it is now possible that the incision be made over this species and over the remaining flesh: and you should cut the skin of the testicles. Then extend the knife upwards, and extract it with a white forceps: and free the suspensory ligament from the vein, and ligate the vein: and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from all parts of the vein.
If therefore the knife is consolidated with those flesh tissues, then you should draw the knife, and cut it.
And if there is adhesion between something from the siphaket, or in what is between the veins: then you should free the entire adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
If there is a flesh birth at a place of adhesion which is behind, then you must cut through the entire thing, and extract the egg, as we have said.
When therefore your operation is completed,填空 - 应该是 "then fill the wound with wool浸润在玫瑰油和酒中：" and thereafter care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter LXIV.
¶ Concerning the care of Ramicis, which is with Vite.
Vitre is an abscess wrapped in a wrapping similar to that of a swelling of the testicles: and it becomes difficult for the sick person due to lack of movement and exercise, and inability to walk.
And in the care of this illness there is from fear, due to the recall of what preceded it.
Indeed, we must say that the operation for this should be performed as the pioneers did.
I say that you must make the sick person sit on an elevated seat. Then press down the suspension of the testicles to the lower area. Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the areas close to the vagina: and let another person hold and stretch them with vigorous extension.
Then cut with a broad sharp blade across the vessels directly until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape from all sides, as we have told you in the extraction of arteries in the temples.
Later, fix a needle with a double thread into them, and ligate it at the first places where the veins occur: and ligate it again at the last of them. Then cut it straight in the middle section according to the length of the body, and extract what is aggregated from the decomposed foul humors.
Then care for the wound as you would with other wounds in which you see sanguine matter forming, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle fall. For it is not evil through that.
If the vein occurs in all the vessels, then it is necessary to extract the testicles and vessels for this reason: so that the womb is not deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and does not waste away or burn, and there will be no use for them.
Chapter LXV.
¶ Concerning the care of the Ramus Intestinalis.
The cause of this Ramus is from the section that occurs in the sifach extended over the abdomen in the groin area from the wind of the belly.
Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle. And this rupture is either from the sifach or its extension.
And these two species occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a leap, or a cry, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar events.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach. It is something that occurs gradually over a long period of time and does not happen suddenly: and it is an apostema equal in width to its depth: therefore, because the same compresses the intestine.
And its sign when it is from the incision of the apostema, because it causes a sudden severe pain at the beginning: and it is an apostema different, appearing beneath the skin and nearby: and that is due to the passage of the intestine, and its course to the exterior.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine around it: and this is called the Intestinal Ramus, and zirbia: and sometimes it occurs with flatulence.
And sometimes it runs into the intestine and is retained there: and this is detrimental to the patient: for it causes a severe pain, especially when it is compressed.
And in the treatment of cases of this illness with iron, there is fear; therefore, it is necessary to be careful in such cases.
And the method of operation is to instruct the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand to the inner concavity of his body, if it yields to the return. Then it is turned upside down over its neck between your hands: and lift its legs.
Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut the entire length of the scrotal skin. Then fix clamps in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and the incision should be made as much as possible so that the egg can emerge.
Then excise the syphilis, and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until when the white syphilis is revealed, hard from all parts: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, that which is between the white syphilis, which is beneath the skin of the scrotum, and between the second syphilis, and complete the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the scrotum.
Then probe with your right hand into the skin of the testicles: and with this, elevate the white syphilis upwards with your left hand: and raise the scrotum with the white syphilis to the section area: and direct your assistant, that he extend the scrotum upwards: and you release the adhesion which is behind the completion of the incision.
And examine with your fingers that there is nothing from the intestine involuted in the hard white syphilis. If you find anything from it: then push it downward toward the abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, made of ten strands: and insert it at the last syphilis, that is, the tunica which is beneath the skin of the testicle following the section: then cut the ends that protrude from the thread until there are four strands. Then join some of them over those with the figure which is in the shape of a cross: and ligate with them around the syphilis, about which we said, because it is beneath the skin of the testicle with a strong ligature, until no part from the vessels, which nourish them, can send anything to them: so that no hot abscess may occur. And place the ligature again outside the first ligature, distant from it by less than two digits. And after these two ligaments are removed from the skin beneath the testicles, take the size of a finger's breadth: and cut the rest according to its roundness, and remove the ovum.
Then dry the lower part of the skin incision of the testicles from which the blood and pus flow, as we have described earlier.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound: and apply the ligament as we have described. And when the white skin which we have mentioned is cauterized after its incision, be careful about the flow of blood. For this often happens. And remove the ligament until it falls by itself.
If the case is delayed, then soak it in warm water: and place what we have said above it until it falls.
Then care for the wound with the remaining wound treatment until it is healed.
Chapter LXVI.
¶ For Ramie Ventosa.
In This For Ramie Ventosa, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron in its treatment.
And first they said that it occurs as we have described for the Ramie which is mixed with Vine. That is, you should ligate the vessels after the incision and place them below with ease: then dry in the middle, and care for it lastly as what opens it, until the vessels fall: and care for the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Head LXVII.
On the rupture that occurs in the groin.
When a Rupture occurs in the inguins, as we have said, and the site protrudes, but nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is only a little and returns in all hours; indeed, if this persists over time, an additional fissure is added to the sac, until the intestines descend into the sac.
And this occurs from the extension of the sac, which is in the inguins, as we have said. Because the sac extends: then it softens, and the site becomes inflamed and protrudes.
And its care is with cauterization, as the previous narration has preceded it.
And sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and the patient should lie on his back between your hands. Then dry the site of the rupture, which is inflamed and protruding, by cutting laterally, according to the width of three fingers.
Then stitch the sac and what is beneath the skin until the white sac, which is beneath the skin that follows it, is revealed.
Then take a needle and place it over the protruding site from the sac, and press it deeply into the abdomen.
Then stitch the two protruding sites at the end of the needle from the sac, and connect one with the other using a stitch: then withdraw the end of the needle.
And do not incise entirely, nor tend the vein, nor anything else, as I have taught you in the cure of intestinal ramification.
Then care for that with the wound cure. When therefore you incise the vein, cleanse it, and restore the wound until it is consolidated.
The sinew indeed contracts, and no prominence of rupture is added.
And cauterization is better in this place: for it is nearer to health.
Head LXVIII.
¶ On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
The skin of the testicles is often softened in some people, which causes the flesh between them to soften as well, and spoils the appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is asked to cure this to have the patient lie on his back and incise the entire softened skin over the natural skin.
Then gather the two lips together with suturing: and if you wish, first remove the excess of the softened skin with three or four stitches, and a firm suture.
Then incise between the stitches.
Then care for the other wounds until it is healed, and let the stitches fall out.
Head LXIX.
¶ On Castration.
You should know that Castration is proscribed by our law and for this reason it would be permissible to me not to remember it in my book. And its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
One reason is that it may be included in the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it: and so that he may know the cure for him who suffers from it.
And another reason is that we often need castration of certain animals for our beasts, such as rams, hyraxes, and cats, and similar animals.
I say that Castration is performed according to two methods. Or through friction. Or through a incision and cutting.
In that which is performed through friction, the procedure is as follows: we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles become soft and relaxed and hang down. Then, we apply pressure to them with your hand until they become completely resolved and no longer noticeable upon touch.
In castration through incision and cutting, you must hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Then ligate the suspensory ligament, and cut above all the sacs with a single incision until two sacs appear. Then cut them after you have stripped both of their coverings, and do not leave anything except for a fine thread above the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than that which is performed through friction because friction might leave something behind in the testicles, which would cause the animal to seek copulation.
Then care for the wound until it is healed.
Head LXVII.
¶ Concerning the care of Hermaphroditus in two ways.
Hermaphrodite is of two sexes. Their vagina is apparent because it is clear from the space that follows, or on the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, there is a figure resembling a woman's vulva, with hair: and sometimes urine flows from what is on the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is but one species, and it is a woman's vulva above the clitoris, like very small testicles entirely protruding to the outside: of which one resembles a priapus, and two resemble two testicles.
And the care for three species, two of which are of men, and one of women, is: because it is necessary to cut the added flesh until the impression of them is eliminated. Then care for them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second species of men, from which urine emerges on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, and its care is not complete.
Head LXVIII.
¶ Concerning the incision of Tentigo and protruding flesh in women's wounds.
Tentigo is perhaps added to the natural condition until it spoils and becomes ugly: and sometimes it enlarges in some women so much that it expands like in men, and reaches the point of intercourse.
Therefore you must apply the excrescence of the contagion with your hand or with forceps and cut: and not the last part in the incision, especially at the deep root: so that there does not occur a flow of blood.
Then care for the wound itself with treatment until it is healed.
But flesh has arisen, which is flesh that is born in the opening of the womb, until it fills it: and perhaps it emerges to the exterior according to the likeness of a tail: and on account of this some call the illness taeniac. Therefore you must cut it as you cut the contagion, and treat it until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the care of Alrauttle, which is a wound of the woman that is not perforated.
Chapter LXXII.
Alrauttle is such that it is a wound of the woman that is not perforated, or has a small aperture. And it can be either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from an illness that preceded it: and itself arises either from flesh born added, or fine thread-like substance, or thick: and it occurs either in the deep part of the womb, or on its sides, or on its upper part, or on its lower part: and it prevents intercourse and conception, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And its recognition is made through the observation of midwives if the obstruction is apparent and nearby.
If it is not apparent, then examine it with your fingers or with a probe.
If the abscess is from a fine sponge and is close to two lips [tissues], then act quickly and cut it.
And place poultices over the two lips.
Then place your fingers of both hands simultaneously, and the woman should lie on her back with her legs spread. Then spread the two lips with strength until the fine sponge is cut and the abscess is opened.
Then take a woolen cloth, soak it in oil, and place it over the area. Let the woman apply this daily to ensure the wound does not heal over with scar tissue.
If the sponge is coarse and thick, then you should cut it with a broad blade of a spoon-like leaf of myrtle.
If the abscess is from flesh that has formed, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it. Have with you medicines that control blood flow without causing pain, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and a mixture of storax with white wax.
Then administer a broad copper tube to prevent the wound from healing quickly, hold it for a few days, and apply dry linen. Continue the treatment until it is healed.
And when other animals are born in the womb: it must be cut according to this method: while there is no abscess, for an abscess that is cancerous, what is in the womb will not contradict iron entirely.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
¶ Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athelil, and Bothor rubra in women's vulva.
Hemorrhoids are an opening of the veins, until much blood flows from them continuously.
When therefore hemorrhoids are antiquated, they become thrombosed: and I have already spoken of the division of their species and their signs: and I will say here which of them receive cure and which do not.
I say that hemorrhoids which are in the uterine opening and do not appear by touch: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Those, however, which from them are in the uterine opening upon which sensation falls, are those which can be cured.
Therefore, you should introduce the woman into a cold room. Then extend the thrombosed hemorrhoids with forceps or with a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Then powder them near the flow of blood from one of the cut areas without bruising: as with acacia, and dragon's blood, and tamarisk, and similar substances.
Then press her feet against the wall for one hour. Then lay her down in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peel, and gooseberry, and similar substances.
Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it for her back.
If therefore blood is cut away with it, that is good; and if not, cause the back cups and nipples to adhere, without scarification.
Then take a woolen cloth and immerse it in the juice of colocynth, or the juice of arnoglossum, or the juice of alaula branches, that is, aglanthe, and apply it.
When therefore the abscess is settled, then care for the area with ointments until it heals.
Albarth is reddish and similar to the heads of alhase, and has a rough appearance.
Therefore you must cut what is apparent from it, according to what I said regarding the thilil equally: and care for it until it heals.
Head LXXXIV.
¶ Concerning the perforation of the exitura that occurs in the matrix.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the matrix, such as cancer, and lapideum abscess, and ulcers, and those filled with pus, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thilil, and hot abscess.
And I have indeed already said all these ailments and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary for me to say in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the matrix, when it is from abscesses which collect pus, and you must know how its opening is made with a steel instrument.
Therefore you must consider. Then if the pain of an abscess at its onset is acute with percussion and flame and fever: and you see it redden; if sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with perforation of it: and care for it along with it as may help toward maturation until the acuteness of the accidents quiets.
Then you must cause the woman to sit on a seat which drips from two stools, and recline or foment her back, and draw up her feet toward her lower abdomen: and let her thighs be spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, and bind her with a bandage suitable for that.
Then the midwife should sit from the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the uterus is dilated.
And you must place the instrument so that it enters to the depth of the uterus when you wish to administer this instrument, lest what enters from the instrument be greater than the depth of the uterus and injure the frail one.
If, however, the instrument is deeper than the depth of the uterus, then you must place wicks on the covering of the depth of the uterus: so as to prevent the entire entry of the instrument into the depth of the uterus. And you must place a screw, which runs along the instrument, from the upper side: and hold the instrument, and turn the screw until the depth of the uterus is dilated.
When therefore the exit is apparent and is touched by hand and is soft and yielding: then you must cut it off near its head with a spatula broad.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then you should place on the wound mild and submerged in rose oil, or green oil with some astringency, and place the mild one, and extract the section from the deep uterus.
And place externally over the uterus and over the comb clean wool submerged in water in which pears have boiled.
Then it should be treated with a salve suitable for it for two days until it is healed.
And when the uterus and wound are washed, it should be irrigated with water and honey, then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has boiled: then return to the salve.
And if the wound is hidden internally in the uterus, then you must refrain from treating it with a steel instrument, rather treat it as we have said in the division.
Chapter LXXVI.
The Doctrine of Obstetric Medicine, how to treat living fetuses that have emerged with an unnatural figure.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to first know the natural figure of birth.
From these signs you will know that when you see a woman pressing downward, and desires to smell the air, and something above her related to the birth is lifted away from her, and the exit of the fetus hastens: then you should know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and the exit is over its head, and the afterbirth with it: or hanging, or suspended from the umbilicus.
When therefore you see these signs, then it must be that the abdomen is compressed so that the embryo may descend quickly.
For when it descends to its head, the afterbirth follows it and is cleansed from those excesses with good purification.
Whoever is beyond this birth is unnatural, unfathomable.
For sometimes the fetus emerges over its feet, and its body comes out with its head, its feet, and one of its hands: or its head and its hand come out: or its abdomen emerges: and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar things from the unfathomable figures.
It is therefore necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how the disposition is within it, and it is signified by that, and stands upon it.
When the fetus emerges over its head naturally, and that becomes strenuous for the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see its strength already weakened, then make her sit on a seat, or women hold her: and let vapor from fennel decocted with oil be applied to her.
Then the Obstetrician shall introduce a small spatula between her fingers and find the afterbirth with it, and cut it with her nail until what is inside comes out due to moisture: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman must be administered a cleansing enema with fennel decoction and olive oil.
Then command her after instilling, that it be compressed: and make her sneeze when she is placed, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour. The foetus will immediately emerge.
If two hands of the foetus emerge first, you should reduce them with gentle force gradually. If, however, it does not yield on entering, then place the woman on a seat, and elevate her feet upwards. Then shake the seat upon the ground. And the woman should be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the foetus dies: then cut them and extract the remaining foetus. Bind his hand with a cloth, and extract it equally, for he will emerge himself.
The exit of the embryo over its feet. When the foetus emerges over its feet, then you should push them upwards. Then turn the foetus gradually, and afterwards adjust it.
Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When therefore they emerge up to the hips, then command her that it be compressed, and make her sneeze when she is placed. For she will emerge if God wills it.
And if it does not emerge with what we have narrated, then reduce the foetus gradually until you place it in its natural position. For he will emerge then with an easy exit.
If it is forbidden to use what we have described entirely: then take from the thick mucilage, and olive oil, and dissolved gum: and pound all together in a mortar with good beating: then add linen with it from a woman's womb, and below her abdominal cavity. Then make her sit in warm water until hypochondria is achieved.
When you see that her lower parts are already warmed, then give her a draught of myrrh, and apply it. When she holds the draught for one hour, then make her sit on a seat. Then make her sneeze: and close her mouth and nose: and apply gentle compression to the lower part of her abdomen. For the fetus will immediately emerge.
The exit of the fetus occurs over the knees and hands. When it emerges in this form, then introduce your hands gradually. Then let the woman be laid on her back with her head elevated, and her feet hanging down below: and she should lie on the bed, and fold her hands. Then apply gentle compression above her abdomen. Then extract what is below her feet from the cloths until it is prepared in the lower part. If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with violent motion. Then apply gentle compression above the hypochondria until the fetus ascends to the upper parts. Then insert his hand and equalize the fetus gradually: and command the woman that it may be compressed until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands. Let there be devised in the reduction of his hand. If, however, he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
If she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her thighs with a violent shaking.
Then apply the ointment you have prepared from mucilages.
If she receives the delivery, then make her sit on a seat. Then study the reduction of his hand, and equalize the fetus according to its natural position: and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is toward the back of its mother. The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then roll it gradually, and equalize it with ease.
When it is equalized, then place it over the vulva as we have instructed with oil and mucilages.
Then command her to move gradually. When you have done this, then make her sit on a seat, and command her to lean to the right side. Then command her, that she be compressed: and make her sneeze as she is placed.
The exitus foetus praeparati super latus. When it descends to the uterine-orifice in this manner with the secunda, then cut the secunda with your nail until it is evacuated by the moisture.
If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the umbilicus: so that it is not retained and may die.
Then urge the fetus into the interior, until you place it as it should be: and command the woman to compress herself several times; for it will emerge by the light exit.
The Exitus Geminorum, or foetuum multorum. Know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four. Yet that is foreign and rarely happens.
Yet five are things beyond nature, and do not live at all: and contain them, although they multiply, with one secunda: and are separated by the sifech, distinguishing between them with a tie around each of their umbilici.
And sometimes they emerge as one fetus emerges naturally, easily: and they emerge by an unworthy exit, as we have narrated.
If some of them are difficult at birth, and arrive at that which we said from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have narrated: and let it be a sharp obstetrical instrument, and do what it does with ease and delay, and devise according to every figure with whatever is prepared for it by the skill directing towards health.
Remembrance of that which is formed in the matrix from embryos, and are aborted.
Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the matrix: and it has been verified to me that a woman, aborting, discharged seven, and others fifteen, all formed.
Which was measured by the glorious wise man.
Therefore, this must all be known to obstetricians. For perhaps it will come to be like that one; let him therefore compare it with that one according to what is necessary.
Chapter LXXVI.
On the Extraction of Dead Fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus and it does not pass with the treatment I described in the division of medical therapy, and you are forced to use manual operation, then you should consider.
If therefore the woman is in good health and there are no complications from which fear of loss is justified, then the woman should be laid on her back on a bed, with her head inclined downward and her legs elevated: and the assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not come loose during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the cervix with a mixture of oily liquids and mucilages from fennel and flaxseed.
Then the obstetrician should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then she should introduce it into the cervix with ease. Then he should inquire where he may place the hooks from the fetus, and suitable places for this.
Consider therefore if the fetus is prepared to descend below its head: then place hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its hyoid bone, or in nearby places of its ribs and beneath its knees.
If the descent is below its feet, then place the hooks at the pubic region and midway along its ribs.
And he must hold the hook with his right hand and place its curved part between the fingers of his left hand. He should introduce it with ease and place the hook at one of the places we have mentioned until it reaches the empty space.
Then place another hook opposite it, or a third if needed, so that the contraction is equal and does not偏移。
Then extend it with equal tension, and do not stretch it only straight. Rather, move it in all directions to facilitate its expulsion: just as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it must be placed between the hook and the area, so that the tension is relaxed. If a part is retained, then the Obstetrix should grease some fingers with oil and introduce them from the side to rotate and dislodge what is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be moved to a higher location. Do this until the entire fetus has emerged.
If therefore the hand comes out first and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it must be covered with a cloth. Then extract it until the entire hand comes out, and cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow: and thus you must do the same in the other hand and in both feet.
If the head of the fetus is large, or there is constriction during exit, or water has accumulated in its head: then it must be that Spatumile with spines is inserted between the fingers, and cut with it the head, and extract the water: or rupture it with the instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which follows.
Similarly, if the fetus has a nature of a large head, then it must be cut with algengam: or extract it with misdach, as we have said. Then extract the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out and is constricted at the pelvis: then cut it until the moisture in the chest is discharged.
If, however, it is not constricted and does not yield to extraction: then cut the head gradually, according to what is possible for you.
If the lower part of the abdomen is infected with an apostema or has hydrocele: then you must puncture it until the moisture flows out from it.
If the fetus is above the feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the maternal pelvis is gentle.
If it is constricted within the abdomen or chest: then you must extract it with the cloth you have wrapped around your hand: and expand the abdomen or chest until that which is within them passes.
If the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns: then the Obstetrician shall introduce his left hand. If therefore the opening of the womb is open, then introduce the hand into the depths of the womb, and seek out the head, and draw it with the fingers until the head reaches the opening of the womb: then introduce one hook or two hooks, and draw it with them.
If the opening of the womb is constricted, owing to a hot abscess that has occurred: then it is not necessary to labor over it, but rather it is necessary to administer an application of moist substances, oils: and apply poultices: and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
If the fetus is in a breech position, then it is possible to bring it into a normal position: then administer what we have said regarding a live fetus.
If it is not possible to bring it into a normal position, then cut it out and extract it.
And you must not let anything remain inside the afterbirth completely.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said regarding hot abscesses that occur in wombs.
If there is a flow of blood, then let it be immersed in astringent waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
And I have indeed seen a woman whose fetus had died in her womb: then she became pregnant again by another intercourse and the fetus died once more. Therefore, after a long time, a boil appeared at his navel and it became inflamed until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
I was therefore called to cure him, and I treated him for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
I therefore applied to him some strong attracting ointments: and the abscess discharged from its place. Then some days passed, and another abscess discharged. I therefore wondered then, since there is no abscess in the womb.
I therefore concluded that the abscesses were from the bones of the dead fetus.
I therefore examined the wound and extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and she has now lived for a long time, discharging only a little pus.
And I did not firm this external application here, except because there is knowledge and assistance in it for what the skilled physician does with his hand in treatment.
Head 77.
¶ Concerning the Forms of Necessary Instruments in the Extraction of the Fetus.
The form of the Vertigo that opens the matrix.
Here is the form of the Forceps, which has two cogs at both ends of two wooden rods. Truly, this Vertigo must be finer than a strictorium: and it is to be made either of ebony or of bussi wood.
And let the width of every piece of wood be about two fingers: and the edge of each is about one finger, and the length of each is a palm and half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already hardened on both, whose length is half a palm more or less: and the width of each is about two fingers, or more or less.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you rotate the two Vertigo devices.
Another form for the same purpose, finer and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony or bussi wood, according to the likeness of forceps. Truly, at the extremity thereof are two additions, as you see above: and the length of each addition is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
When therefore you wish to open the matrix with it, then cause the woman to sit on a bed, with her feet hanging between her legs. Then insert these two additions joined together into the matrix: and you are holding the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity you wish from the opening of the matrix's mouth, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alii dicunt Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.
And sometimes it is oblong, like a forceps according to this form, as you see, having teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Vinculi habentis spinam unam.
Forma Vinculi habentis spinas duas.
Forma Spathamilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.
Forma duorum Spathamiliorum etiam latorum.
These instruments are all used, and the more various their forms are, and the better prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster they are for use, and the more valuable they are to men, on account of their quantity.
Therefore, do not disregard any of these instruments, for they should be prepared for you. For their necessity is inexcusable.
Chapter LXXVIII.
¶ On the Extraction of the Secunda.
When Secundina retains the child at childbirth, then you must command the weak one to hold her breath. Then make her sneeze when you place something: and grasp her mouth with your hand, and her nostrils. If it therefore emerges through this, it is good.
If not: then take a pot and make a hole in its cover: and put herbs opening the mouth of the uterus in it, as calamus, rue, angelica, chamomile, safflower, and cinnamon wood, and centaury: take all these herbs or some of them, and submerge them in water, and place them on fire.
Then place a reed bulb over the hole in the pot's cover, and the other end in the uterus: and hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the uterus.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said. Secundina will then emerge with facility.
If, however, Secundina remains after this treatment and does not emerge, then command the midwife to immerse her hand in olive oil or acacia gum. Then introduce it into the uterus and seek out Secundina with it. When therefore she finds it, then take it and extend it gradually.
If, however, it is attached deeply in the uterus, then introduce your hand, as we have described, until when you find Secundina, and extract her gradually in a straight line to prevent the uterus from falling due to strong suction: rather, it should be moved with ease to the right and left sides, and then added in proportion to the strength of the suction. For then it yields to this, and is secured, and is discharged from adhesion.
If the mouth of the matrix is constricted, as we have already narrated: care for it with sneezing, and from the medicament of the pot with herbs.
If it does not discharge with all that we have narrated, then beware lest you fatigue yourself in repeating the extraction.
Indeed, what discharges to the mouth of the matrix, bind it to the thigh of the woman. Then cleanse her with a clyster using a tetrapharmcon ointment. For it will putrefy her after a few days, and dissolve, and discharge.
Indeed, when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and affects them unfavorably. Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered for this.
Some of the ancients have already found fumigations with nasturtium and dried figs to be effective.
The form of the instrument with which fumigations should be administered to the woman during retention of Secundine and menstruation.
Let the instrument be made like a cama or from zephyr reed. Place the broad end over the fire, and position the fumigation above the pine branches. Hold it until that fumigation is consumed, then repeat with another.

¶ On the treatment of an unperforated wound.
Many boys are born, and their ani are not perforated, which he has already treated with a fine instrument. Therefore, the midwife must perforate that with her finger: and if not, she must perforate it with a sharp Spatumilium: and let her beware lest the finger touch it.
Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If you fear that it is infected, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wants to void.
And infection of the ani has also occurred due to the consolidation of the wound or abscess. Therefore, that consolidation must be cut out, and then it must be treated with what we have said regarding treatment and lead.
Head LXXX.
¶ Concerning the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodatio and Grossitudo, which occur near the anus outside or in the space of one part: and they can be one fistula or multiple.
When therefore that Nodatio is incised, it is opened, and a watery white fluid or fine pus flows from it.
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating. Therefore, the penetrating substances are known through that which is excreted, and by windiness, when the sick person uses evacuation: and perhaps a worm emerges from them.
And they are from them Fistulas when they are penetrating in space until the bladder, and until the meatus urethrae. And they are from them penetrating until the hip joint, and until the coccyx.
From the place where it is known that a penetrating fistula goes to the anus, even if not penetrating, you should insert your index finger into the anus: and insert a fine probe from the air or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
If there is tortuosity in it, then insert a fine probe made of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything come out of the opening during evacuation, nor windiness, nor a worm as I said: then know that it is non-penetrating. Therefore, proceed immediately to treatment.
And when a fistula is penetrating to the bladder or to the urethral meatus: then its indication is the exit of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the area may be consolidated with medications.
If it is penetrating to the hip joint or to the socket of the hip: then its sign is that a probe can reach there if there is no tortuosity to the socket. And the discovery of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus always emerges from it: and that treatment does not work there, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all these fistulas penetrating there is no complete cure: and the cure of them is labor and vanity to him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
In that one which is not penetrating and not old, cure is hoped for with a sword: according as I report to you, and I have now tested: and it is, that the sick man lie upon his back in your hands, and raise his legs until above his hips, and let his thighs be inclined towards his own belly. Then introduce a lead or air tube, if there is a tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where it has arrived by probing.
If the patient feels it around the anus, then you must introduce your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel by your finger that the probe has already penetrated through itself detected, beyond which you feel between your finger and either the sphincter or the flesh, then you may know surely that it is a penetrating fistula: hence do not labor in it, for there is no cure for it, as we have said.
They have also said that in some people the flesh is cured, and from the medication by which hope of relief is given, it is necessary to use a fine cautery ignited according to the width of the fistula, as has been mentioned before, and to introduce the ignited one into the fistula until it reaches the anus. Then repeat this process twice or three times until you know that all those added fleshlike tissues similar to the veins of a bird have been cauterized.
Then dress it with clean bandages in butter until the cauterized flesh has healed: then treat it with ointments that promote the growth of flesh and strengthen it.
If therefore it is cured, that is good.
And if not, then it is not cured with any other cure.
And if it issues forth with the probe, and does not endure until your finger, which is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or sinus between it and the probe, and you see an abscess where the surface of the skin follows, then dry the skin from the beginning of the abscess, and you proceed cutting with the probe that is in the abscess until the cutting reaches the point where the probe's end emerges, and the probe is freed and falls.
Then cleanse those sliced tissues, which resemble bird feathers, so that nothing remains from them.
If however blood overcomes you and separates those tissues from you and the operation by cutting them, then it is better that you cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Since cauterization with fire aggregates good qualities, such as the burning of those added tissues, the cutting of blood, and the drying up of moisture.
Then care for it with clean bandages in butter or mashed cucumbers until the place discharges pus, and those burned tissues exit as pus.
Then care for the wound with consolidating ointments that generate hard flesh: and use medicines that contain astringents and drying properties.
For when they are healed, then it is already cured: and you need not fear recurrence.
If, however, the Fistula has reached the depth of the anus and has lengthened due to bodily discharge: then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with it.
If therefore you feel a partition, and between you and it is a covering of skin or flesh, and it is near penetration: then there is no operation on it, unless according to the way of faith and hope.
Which is because it is treated in one of three ways: either you cauterize it as we said, or you cut it off until you reach its cavity so that it is possible for you to insert a probe and effect a cure nearby. And do not cut too much so as not to penetrate the muscle containing the anus, and happen an involuntary evacuation of feces to the weak. Then care for it as we have said.
For it may be cured: or you may lengthen this covering, and cleanse it after drying it near the anus, as we have said, or by probing it, or with another sharp instrument. Then cleanse those filtered tissues that are in the incision until you can do so with probing.
Then attempt the healing of the wound in its entirety with the incision and the upper opening where it heals. And the fistula will remain open in the inner part of the anus, and this will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is sewn according to this method: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the body surface with skin and the edge of the anus: then take the probe with its perforated end, which is like an awl, that is, a preparation needle, according to this form. And insert into it a wound-wrapped thread of five strands, and about that. Then insert the speculum with a thread into the fistula until its cavity is reached.
If therefore it penetrates to the internal margin near the anus, then withdraw the thread from that opening: thus insert your finger into the anus and withdraw the end of the thread, and tie the two ends together: and tighten both, and let it remain for one or two days: and the more the thread penetrates into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the two ends of the thread necroses and falls off: then care for the wound until it consolidates and heals.
If the fistula opening is not yet penetrable, then make it penetrate in any way prepared for you, unless it be deeply situated. For you do not have the option to make it for the sake of a lizard without piercing it.
Then proceed with it as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the pointed speculum for treating the fistula is such that one end is very sharp, and the other end is not sharp so as to avoid piercing what is unnecessary, as you can see.
Chapter LXXXI.
For the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows after incising them: and care for fissures.
There are hemorrhoids in two modes. For either they are within the anus, similar to bladder carbuncles or warts: or they are like grains of wheat. And from them are fine and great: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many. And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum pauci humores, ex quibus currit aqua citrina aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colore corporis.
And the cure for what is within the anus is that you should advise the patient to assellet: and it should be expressed until the anus expels it and the athelils appear to you. Therefore, hang them with hooks: or hold them with your fingernail. Then cut them at their roots.
If, however, they are not retained with hooks due to their moisture and softening: then grasp them with a rough cloth, or with a forceps made of doubled linen thread, and extract them with your fingers. Then cut them, and pulverize some hot powders over the incisions afterward, so that they may serve as a substitute for cautery. Or cauterize them according to what was described in the chapter on cauterization. Then cure them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
If the anus does not yield to expulsion, then administer a clyster with a small dose of emetic, so that it may induce vomiting along with what is in the anus, and cause it to yield quickly when the patient expels it.
If the abscesses are external to the anus, then they are light and easy: and you may take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them. Then care for them as we have said until they are cured.
And if one fears making an incision with a knife, then it must be sewn up according to this manner. Take a thread wrapped around a needle and insert it into the eye of the needle. Then extract the abscess to the top, and make it penetrate with the needle at the root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle, making them wide: and tightly tie the abscess with a strong knot. Then tie off the thread with a knot, and extract the needle.
Do this with all the abscesses, and leave one open to allow the excess blood to flow out.
Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate over the anus and put it on the anus: and order the patient to rest. Then leave it there until it falls off.
When the abscesses therefore fall, care for them with ointments and other treatment until they are cured.
¶ Concerning the Care of Fissures. For fissures often occur from the drying effect of feces and natural contraction.
When therefore they are ancient and medicine does not avail in them: then it must be scraped with points of Spatumilis, or with your own nail, until they become moist, and the outer cortex which prevents their consolidation must be removed. Then care for them until they consolidate as required.
If they do not consolidate: then scrape them with a more vigorous reason than the first, until they bleed much, and let them drain. Then care for them until they are healed.
¶ Concerning the care of Almirmar both with and without inversion, and Athelil ulcers, and those caused by ants.
Chapter LXXXII.
Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the body, primarily in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and pain happens because of it during walking.
Therefore, it must be cut what is around the head of the nail, and it should be held with tweezers or a hook, and extracted from its root.
Then care for that: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what was preceded in its own chapter.
From Athelil ulcers, there is one small prominence, rough, stratum-like, round above the surface of the body. And it often occurs in the hands of children.
And its care is to expand the Athelil, and cut it: or tie it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls. And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been mentioned with fire, or with sharp medicine: and now the inverted and not inverted thorns are eradicated with the instrument that I shall say.
A freckle is also a small elevation filtered, coarse, on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when it finds it, cold is felt in it similar to the bite of a ant, and it happens throughout the body: and most of it happens in the hands.
And the treatment for it is, that you take a quill from an eagle's feather or from a vulture's strong feather, and place that quill over the freckle until a circle of skin around the freckle is affected. Then turn your hand with the quill until you separate what is around the freckle: and place it deeply into the flesh, and eradicate the freckle from its root.
And if you wish, do this with an air quill or iron quill according to this form.
Place the quill at its upper limit, drawing out the deaf appendage, so as to relieve the grip on the finger and its turning.
And if you wish, cauterize the freckle according to what has been mentioned in the cauterization of thorns in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter LXXXIII.
¶ Of the Forms of Instruments Administered for Enemas in Diseases of the Anus, and Bowel Relief, and Colic.
Sometimes an enema is made from silver, or from brass, or from drawn copper, or from beaten copper.
And sometimes these Instruments are made small and great according to those in which they are administered.
That which is administered in the cure of small children should be small: and of those whose ages are weak or painful, so also with their enemas.
Enema great.
The cannula, that is, the upper head in which the uterus is ligated, should be large according to this mode: and there should be a distinction so that the uterus is ligated as you see, and the lower extremity which is inserted into the anus, should be deaf, that is, not open, soft, very fine, drawing towards subtlety: and on one side thereof are two orifices, and on the other side one orifice.
And the width of the orifice should be according to the thickness of the ribs, and somewhat broader, and the uterus in which medicines from animal bladder or from sheepskin are placed, should be according to the shape of a small asafetida: whose root is one palm.
And it should be perforated with many orifices as it is revolved, and the space between each orifice should be the width of a finger. Then insert a strong thread from raw fiber, which should be made of ten threads or about that number, and attach it to the cannula as with a small asafetida. When therefore the cannula is placed therein, it should be tied at the head of the enema between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong string. Then the enema should be attached to it.
And this is the form of the circle here depicted, and of the holes.
The quality of the enema for this purpose is as follows: fill the vessel or bladder with medicine which has been heated according to the tolerance of the patient, and be careful that it is not excessively hot or excessively cold.
Then the patient is turned face downward on his back, and raises his legs toward the upper part: and place under him a cushion, that is, a skin or cloth upon which men lie.
Then anoint the end of the enema with oil, or with white vitriol, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances. Then insert it into the anus with ease. Then the servant holds the vessel with both hands and expresses it vigorously until all the enema is evacuated into the intestine.
Then remove the enema, and the patient raises his legs against the wall.
If the medicine causes him to expel it, then he should hold it as much as possible. And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial in relief.
If, however, you give him an enema during attacks of colic and hastens its expulsion: then repeat the enemas until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then use a very fine, gentle enema with those enemas that are used for children.
And this be the form of a thin enema for which the skin is drawn taut.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already spoken of the division of the treatment of wounds in the book, and I will now speak of the treatment using hands and medicines according to need.
I say that wounds are varied according to the manner in which they are inflicted, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore, the things by which wounds are inflicted are often like the throwing of a stone, or a cut with a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or wood, or an arrow, and similar things from many objects.
Wounds that are inflicted according to the places of the body are, for example, a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the flank, and similar ones from other body parts.
And I shall now narrate the treatments of certain wounds, that I may set forth this reasoning and rule for other wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, for the recollection of their composition will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore. When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture of the bone, consider then if it is from the throwing of a stone or something similar, and has only broken the skin: and it is a large wound, and fear the possibility of a severe outcome such as an apsteme (a feverish abscess): then hasten, and immediately perform a cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay that: and draw off from him blood according to the quantity of his strength: if nothing forbids phlebotomy, especially if the blood issuing from the wound is scanty. And let phlebotomy be from the opposite part of the wounded area.
And let phlebotomy be from the opposite part of the wounded area. And let the patient beware from repletion, and wine, and fatty foods.
If, however, something prohibits diminution, then it should be diminished from food, and let him not approach flesh, nor wine.
And apply over the wound if it happens to him an hot abscess, soak cotilage in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
If, however, you are free from a hot abscess, then apply over the wound if it is recent with its own blood, and has not changed by air, the powder which I shall narrate presently: and if it has already changed by air, then apply to it certain ointments until it is healed.
If, however, the wound is large, or is from a cut by a sword or similar: and its lips do not aggregate through granulations, then aggregate them with sutures, according to what I shall narrate about wounds of the abdomen regarding their suturing.
If, however, the wound has been detected from the bone and hangs down, and there is no retention of it except by a small ligature: then cut it. Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore flesh hard in place of skin, and command the patient to nourish himself with foods that are fatty, such as meat and cooked wheat, until he is well: and similar things.
If you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut away the entire putrefied part, and discard it: then treat that.
If, however, there is an artery or vein from which blood flows in these wounds: and it cannot be severed by medicines, then inquire about the artery. If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with Spatumili, or ligate it. If necessity prompts it when it does not bring what we have said, then cauterize it until the blood is severed.
If, however, these wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy and gentle: so that you may dust them with this powder, for it will consolidate them before the air changes them.
¶ The Method of the Powder of Incarnated Blood. Recipe of libanum one part, and of dragon's blood two parts, and of unextinguished lime three parts: grind all together much, and sift it. Fill the wound with it, and bind it with good binding until it adheres well upon itself and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it above with strips of cloth, and remove it, not loosening it while it remains, so that it does not become inflamed. For medicine does not remove it until it is cured.
And sometimes it is made with lime alone, when you do not have libanum or dragon's blood. Even so, it performs the same operation on many from large wounds, when it is fit to be placed upon them and bound, and the wounds are recent with their own blood, which has not been altered by air.
If, however, the air has altered them with a certain alteration, especially when it is in the summer season, then this is not the intent of placing this powder. Therefore, treat it with what we have said, so that you may place some digesting ointment on it: or place on it poultices made from barley flour, mixed with water and honey, until pus is discharged. Then care for the rest with the remaining cure until they are healed.
If there happens to be a fracture of the bone with a wound, and it is small, then extract it with Gesti: and I will now say the cure for fractures of the head when that comes.
¶ Of Wounds of the Neck.
If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment and it is the same as a wound of the head when it is simple.
If the nerve of the neck or the artery has already been incised: then if it is a nerve, there is no special skill, except that the cure for it should be treated with strong cauterization, as with ziniar and zegi and similar substances. Since the nerves are harmful and contract them.
And do not place anything completely cold over the wound: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuity is with the brain, which is the most sublime of bodily parts. Let it be what is used to be cured by medicines gently, such as chalk moistened with sweet water several times infused with oil or rose oil, and tuthia, when washed even with sweet water: and the other wet mineral stones according to this manner, and ointments.
If the wound is large, then administer stitches: or draw the edges of the wound together with pins. Then care for it until it is healed.
If the wound be deep, or a sinus occurs in the lower part thereof, in which pus has already aggregated, then puncture it in a more depressed place therein.
If the artery is already incised in the wound and there is a flow of its blood: then separate it, or dry it, and ligate it; or cauterize it if necessity demands that.
If the spinal cord is already injured to the throat or entirely, and the organs have been saved or not: then join the skin margins with sutures over the throat, and do not touch the throat, but equalize it, and reduce it to its natural form. Then suture it tightly, and release it after a few days. Then care for it with ointments containing styptic and drying ingredients until it is healed.
If the wound has already made an impression in the bone, then probe it. Then if there are any fragments of bone therein, remove all that you can or those that are ready for removal; leave that which is not prepared until the wound decays and is separated and facilitated by drainage.
If the wound is recent, then dust it with the powder I have described. If bone is found in the wound and a fistula occurs, then care for it along with what is described in the chapter that mentions it.
¶ Of the Wound on the Back of the Hand.
If it is a blow with a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider. If therefore the wind passes from the wound and the sick person is breathing from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
If it has no depth, and is recent with its own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor compress it, so that blood does not remain in its depth and return to the heart and kill the sick: but put attractive ointment on it, and release it twice a day.
If indeed ointment is not present for you, then put on the wound an old wick, so that it may absorb what passes from it due to moisture: and make sure the sick person sleeps over the wound, so that what aggregates there may flow.
If indeed three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasm, nor bad heart tremor, nor constriction in breathing occur, and you see that all his conditions are good: then know that the wound is healing. Take care of it and treat it with remedies and other treatments until it heals.
If indeed the healing is excused and it opens up again always, then know that a Fistula has formed. Take care of it according to its own chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then take care of it with what preceded it from suturing if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
If, however, he has already made an incision in the bone and fragments result from it: then inquire about the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments if they are separated. If, however, they are not separated, then leave them alone until the wound putsrefies, for the extraction of them will be detrimental.
The judgment concerning the accidents of wounds in other parts is the judgment which we have said.
Of wounds of the abdomen, and the discharge of the intestines, and their treatment.
The disruption that occurs in the abdomen is great, medium, and small.
From a great disruption, the intestine or number of intestines may sometimes emerge.
Hence, there is an intrusion of the intestine, and their suture is more urgent and more difficult.
And even a small disruption can become difficult from another mode. Therefore, the reduction of them becomes more difficult if you do not hasten to place them back in their location during the intrusion: for they swell, open, and become congested, which makes their entry difficult.
Therefore, the disruption that is medium becomes better: for while the reduction of the intestine does not become difficult with it, it does so with these two species.
Know that the suturing of the vein is according to four modes.
Two common stitches are suitable for stitching the abdomen and other wounds of the body, and two other stitches properly communicate with other wounds. However, they are more proper for the stitching of the abdomen: and I will tell you about each with explanation and declaration.
I say, when a wound is small and something from the intestines emerges from it, making it difficult to reduce it: then it is due to one of two methods. Either because of the looseness of the rupture, as we have said: or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Therefore, when this is the case, it is necessary to warm it, thus submerging a sponge or wet cloth in warm water. Or boil it in water with saffron, calamus, and pepper, and foment the intestine with this until the inflation resolves.
Sometimes it causes the use of wine in which styptic herbs are mixed: and this is better than water alone in resolving inflammation.
Therefore, when you see the inflammation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea or mallow has been boiled. For through this, the entrance of the wound is alleviated with small contents.
If the return is prevented after this cure, then reduce the rupture slightly with the instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better when prepared than cutting: and there is no forced necessity to cut after it becomes necessary and the instrument is lacking.
Let one part of it be twisted and sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let its extremity not be very fine like that of Spatumilis, but somewhat more blunt: and that is similar to a cauda, as you see.
When therefore the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it must be reduced according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible above it: for that is better.
When the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it must be made to lie on its back, and raise its legs higher than its head. And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then raise its head and its chest higher than its lower part.
And similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then direct your attention and consideration always to this, that the part where the wound is situated be higher than the other part.
And so it must be applied in great wounds, and in medium-sized wounds.
In small wounds, place it according to how it is prepared for you.
Then make sure a pious minister is present with your hands, who holds the entire disruption with his hand and draws the edges together. Then detect the proper interval for the stitch after the stitch: and this is the common interval for a single stitch.
And you should take the needle, or the number of needles according to the width of the wound. Then release from the end of the disruption the quantity of the ring finger, that is, the medic: and fix one needle outside what you will introduce into it thread in two extremities of skin, with two extremities of sinew beneath the skin from within, until you make it penetrate from another part, and now you have aggregated two extremities of skin, and two extremities of sinew: and they become four orders.
Then tie with double thread around the needle several times from both parts simultaneously, until the two edges of the wound are properly aggregated.
Then release the thickness of the finger as well, and fix another needle in them: thereafter thread it with thread, just as you did with the first needle. Therefore, do not cease to do this with those needles where you need to, until you complete the constriction of the wound entirely.
And let the needles be of medium thickness between the thick and thin: for very thin needles quickly pierce the flesh, while thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin. Therefore, they should be of medium thickness both in fineness and thickness.
And it is not necessary to fix the needle in the two adjacent extremities of the skin too closely: so that the flesh is not quickly pierced, and the wound is not opened before its healing, and do not extend even during suturing, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
Then cut the extremities of the needles, so that they do not harm the weak person during their sleep: and place small cloth pads from all sides on them, which hold the extremities of the needles: and release them until you know that the wound has already healed.
And this very kind of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds. Since one or two needles suffice for stitching them.
The second kind of stitching is common, as you gather the edges with four: edges, two of skin, and two edges of flesh, placing them in pairs together, using a needle on which a thread equal in thinness and thickness is wound.
Then, when you have penetrated the four edges with the needle, withdraw the needle from the same part where you began, so that the thread wound from the upper part of the wound falls: let the stitching be as stitching of cloth which is tied together with threads, and place the thickness equivalent to a minor finger's breadth between every stitch.
Men know this kind of stitching.
And with this kind of stitching, I缝合了我自己腹部的一个伤口，这个伤口是一位被刀刺伤的男人的，伤口裂开大约一个手掌宽：并且有大约两个手掌长的肠子从中间的肠道中突出了，伤口在腹中部裂开了。
I therefore reduced that after the intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
The wound therefore consolidated over a period of about fifteen days: and I healed it, and it was cured, and he lived many years thereafter, occupied with his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that it would not be cured.
And by miracle, I healed that without using ointment. Since I was in a place where ointment could not be found, nor anything else from medicines. I applied therefore to the old wound twice a day, and performed frequent washing of it with honey water until it was healed.
I will however mention two kinds of suturing proper according to the narrative speech.
And begin with the sharp suture: insert the needle from the external side to the internal part.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin and enters the muscle according to the length and breadth of the whole body: let the end of the stitch be made on the side where you inserted the needle, and have it penetrate to the other end from the internal part to the external part in the other extremity.
When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same side from the external part to the internal: let the end of the stitch be made on the side where you are now, and have the needle penetrate to the other end from the internal part to the external part. And make the penetration with the movement by which you made it penetrate in the end of the stitch on the other side, until it penetrates into the whole.
Then begin also from this same side, and bring the stitch back with the end which is from the side you just used, and withdraw the needle from the skin where it penetrated.
Then bring it back to that skin, and with the end which is on the other side, make the stitch with this other end: withdraw it from the skin which is on its side, and do this in one way and another: and do it alternately, until you have brought it outside completely according to that example.
And the sum of this suturing is that you should use their skin-sewing stitches as they sew skins: thus you should place one stitch on one side of the edge of the skin and then release it on the other side, until you complete it.
Second kind of proper suturing, which Gale said.
This his speech is narrated thus: as they use it according to similarity, so that they join every part to its proper comparison in nature; and they apply the extremity to another extremity, and the extremity mirach to the extremity of the other. And this is done according to what I narrate to you.
You must fix the needle at the extremity mirach close to you from the outer side, and make it penetrate into the inner part in that place: and release the two extremities thus. Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outer side into the inner part at two extremities thus, namely on both sides.
Then turn both needles, and make each penetrate from the inner side to the outer side at two extremities mirach alias, which are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suturing is better than the common easy method, and is the suture of which the reminder preceded.
This is therefore Galen's speech as well.
And some have said. The suturing of the abdomen is done with two needles. That is, you should introduce into both with one thread: and begin with the needle being introduced, from what is at your disposal, and make it penetrate up to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew skins equally.
And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the abdomen: then the suture of it is more difficult than the other places of the abdomen.
True judgment of wound treatment is the judgment of other wounds.
That is, when you examine a recent wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and reduce the intestine, and its own part, and apply the appropriate treatment, then place it over powdered incense.
If the air has already altered the wound, then place upon it certain ointments that are present with you until they produce pus. And let the threads fall out, and may sinew be strengthened and mirech. Then treat it as the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
If, however, the medicines are not present with you, then place upon it immediately as soon as it begins to emit pus, old croton: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
For you do not need other medicines in many cases when wounds are simple.
If, however, you fear that the wound communicates with the principal members in the injury, then it must be that you immerse a soft cloth in tempered warm oil, or in rose oil, and place it around the areas between the thighs and under the armpits.
If he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then use the enema with styptic wine, black and warm: particularly if the putrefaction has already come into the intestine and a penetrating discharge is made until it reaches the curvature of it.
And know that which is from the large intestine is more easily cured, and that which is from the finer parts is more difficult to cure.
The intestine called Iejunum does not receive cure from the wound that occurs in it at all: and this is due to its great number, which is from veins, and their magnitude, and due to the subtlety of its body, and its nearness to the nature of nerves.
If what proceeds from the wound is zirbum, and you perceive it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, time has passed, and it has already become green or black: then you must tie it with a thread above the place that has darkened from it, so that there does not occur a flow of blood. In zirbum there are veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the attraction of it and the extraction of it at the time of the zirbum will aid you, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
**Remembrance of the wound that occurs in the Intestine.**
When a disruption occurs in the Intestine and it is small: then it is possible that it may be restored in some people: therefore, for I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old: and a Fistula was formed, and evacuation occurred from it.
Therefore I provided the treatment until I was not confident in its cure: nor did I cease to refine it until it was healed and the site was strengthened.
After I saw the site had become consolidated, I feared for the patient, lest some evil happen to him in his belly: and no evil happened to him from that. And he remained in better condition, eating and drinking, and cohabiting, and bathed, and exercised on his diet.
And some experienced practitioners have said that when a small wound occurs in the Intestine, then it should be ligated in this manner. And you should take ants of large heads. Then bring together the two edges of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth over the two edges of the wound. When therefore it clamps onto the wound and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Then place another ant nearby the first, and continue doing this with each ant in proportion to the size of the entire wound.
Then reduce it and treat the wound. For the head remains attached to the intestine until the intestine is nourished and heals, and no further harm occurs to the sick person.
And it is now possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread: which is extracted from the intestine of an animal and attached to it after it is introduced into the needle.
And you should take the end of this thread from the intestine and it should be thoroughly dried. Then tie with a fine thread wrapped around the end of it. Then introduce that thread into the needle, and use it with the intestine. Then reduce it to the disruption.
And this method of suturing with threads and intestine is not possible except through the way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines, then the only skill is to ligate it tightly, and its complete healing is not possible.
¶ Concerning the care of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Know that every wound or apsema, when it grows old and becomes chronic, fails to heal and always discharges pus and does not close up: then it is universally called a fistula wherever it may be in the body, and we call it zuchemen.
And Fistula is indeed a filtered knot, hard, white: with which there is no pain, and it has the concavity of an bird's feather: and because of that, some call it Risati, that is, feather.
And it is moist in some hours, which emits pus. And perhaps the moisture is split in some hours. And at times this moisture is much, and little: and it is thick, and it is thin.
And I have already mentioned in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and new flesh does not grow therein is not that except for one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of its malice: or because between it and above its lips there is hard flesh, hindering the growth of flesh: or because it is full of filth and uncleanness: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter sent to it is of bad quality: or because the medicine used in its cure is inappropriate: or because corruption falling into that region is a genus of pestilence, or by the property of that region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: where digestion of diseases becomes difficult, and the healing of abscesses is delayed naturally: or because there is one opening or number of bones.
And I have already shown all these causes and signs of them, and the treatments with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment for Fistula and Zucken, which is done through the way of manual operation.
Therefore, you should know that Fistula occurs in all parts of the body. For from these there arise Fistulas that reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews; or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some from the ribs, or to some from the vertebrae of the back, or to some compound joints, such as the hand and foot; and from these there arise those that extend to the vicinity of the principal limb and its like.
Therefore, of these Fistulas, those are according to this mode difficult to cure and do not receive cure, and when they are occupied with them, labor and ignorance arise.
For if it is from any Fistula whose depth does not reach the places I have said: and you hope and confide in its cure, and wish to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe from air or iron, if the Fistula extends straight, and seek it with it.
If there is a tortuosity in the Fistula, then investigate it with probes of fine lead. Since lead, when used with gentleness, yields and bends around the tortuosity.
For if the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate it with probes. Therefore, the Clisteriza is used from its own openings among its other openings.
For the moisture with which you apply the Clisteriza penetrates to other openings and flows from them.
Then inquire precisely according to the manner by which it is possible for you to know whether there is a bone or a nerve there: and whether it is a distant concavity of the Fistula, or near: or whether it is one Fistula with many openings, and stands upon all that, using your utmost strength: by your questioning of the sick, and in finding pain at compression over the place with your hand, and similar significations and causes of accidents apostemati.
Therefore, when you stand in that true station, then proceed to the cure according to your confidence: and then consider whether it is a near Fistula appearing, or at a distant healthy place from the joint, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I have told you: then dry up the Fistula as has been mentioned in my narration, and remove what exists therein from filtration and decayed flesh that arises at its opening from flesh or thelul and similar things: and care for it until it is healed.
If, however, the Fistula is of deep depth and is straight, then it must be cut deeply as far as is possible. Then cleanse it from all decayed flesh.
Then apply an uninwoven cloth in strong medicines: and insert it until it reaches the concavity of the Fistula which you have grasped with your instrument: do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the Fistula from decay.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
If, however, it does not heal through that, then cauterize it as we have described.
If therefore the cause of the Fistula is an opening, and it is certified to you that this is so: then inquire into it and cut it according to what I have told you: if nothing from the vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we said, forbids you.
If therefore an opening is discovered to you, and there is some corruption and blackness in it: then shave it until the entire corruption is removed. Then care for it together with what incarnates it until it is healed.
If it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before: then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore shave over that area again and thoroughly examine it, and perform its cleansing with your utmost diligence.
Then restore it. If therefore it is healed, that is good: and if not, then know that the corruption is at a great depth within the body, which you have not reached. Therefore, you do not have the ability to treat it unless you let nature take its course.
If the opening is slightly corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it with fine forceps that are suited to it.
If there are many bones, then thoroughly perform the extraction of all of them, and do not leave anything out with your diligence.
If however something from the moisture causes you opposition, and there is no fear or mistake in the incision: then cut those moistures and the flesh if they are there, and liberate the bones.
If, however, you do not have the preparation for removing bones at hand, then place something over the wound that will corrupt it: and leave it until what is in the vicinity of those bones from flesh and humidity corrupts.
And watch over the wound so that it does not consolidate. And the section which you made in your operation be tied up. I think place over it, if you fear it, a wick submerged in sulfur rubbed with oil: or a wick submerged in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those humidities putrefy and separate from the bones, the removal of them and the drawing out of them will be facilitated.
If, however, there is one large bone, such as the thigh bone or the socket of the hip, and what has decayed from it is a large part, then shave it with the lastest razor until that blackness and decay are removed. Then restore the wound.
If, however, what is decayed in it is a large part, and the decay has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw through it, and cut it completely until the place where the decay stops. Then take care of it until it consolidates.
And I will tell you what happens to a man in his thigh: so that you may place this example and aid above your operation.
There was a young man in his thirties who experienced pain in his thigh due to a cause that was initiated within the body, that is, from the interior, until the matter reached the thigh and an apostema formed, a large one: and there was no external cause for him.
Therefore, the time has extended with it until the abscess was opened, and many materials converged upon it. And the treatment of it was postponed until the leg became a fistula, and many openings were formed in it, which all discharged pus and bodily humors.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated it for about two years, and there was no skilled hand in it until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials which were flowing from those openings in great quantity: even the whole body of the man was now afflicted, and its color was yellowish.
I therefore introduced a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the cavity.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them communicating with each other from all parts of the leg.
I incised and cut through one of the openings until I reached a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was now consumed, blackened, rotten, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
I cut away what was discovered from the corrupted bone and prepared it.
And I removed what was not in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and cut out. And I had now rooted it out.
Then I applied a restoration of the wound using consolidative medicines over a long space of time. And it was not consolidated.
Then I tested and discovered a continuous decay with the second mouth above the first discovery: and I extracted what appeared to me even from that decay.
Then I attempted its restoration. And it was not restored.
I discovered again above it, and I did not cease to cut into the bone piece by piece and to attempt its restoration: and it was not restored until I cut from the bone about one palm's breadth, and extracted that with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition was not necessary in its operation and sectioning, except on account of the patient's weakened condition, and his limited tolerance, and my fear for him concerning death: for it happened to him at all times from an excess of evacuation due to malignant fainting.
It was therefore completely healed: and flesh hard and well formed grew in its place, and his condition within the body was properly arranged, and his strength returned: and he resumed his usual condition: and walking did not at all harm him.
If the bone is prominent in a place where the body is already fractured, then it must be cut as follows: and do this: take a ligament and tie it at the end of the prominent bone; and command someone to extend it upwards. Then put another ligament, thicker than the first, over it. Then tie it over the flesh which is beneath the bone: and extend its end, so that you draw the flesh downwards: and thus you have tied the flesh above the place you wish to cut, so as not to injure the saw with the flesh.
Place a stick or board under the lower bone in the proper position: for when you do this, it is not prevented that it may cut decayed flesh.
And it must be that the Saw is placed over the decayed place slightly, so as not to be in the concavity of the bone decay: and it should not appear in its appearance to the sense, and force another Sawing upon it.
And if the bone is decayed and not prominent, let a part of it be joined with another part: and the decay is in the middle of it, or in its part; then remove flesh from all parts entirely. Then place a stick below.
Then saw it from the first part where the decay is, until the Sawing continues from the other part: and let the Sawing be slightly according to the length from the decay, as we have said.
And if the decay is at the joint, cut the decayed joint, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
And if the decay is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no skill in it but merely scraping.
And if the decay is in the heel of the hand or the heel of the foot, then the matter is greatly difficult. Truly, you must inquire how the decay appears to you. And scrape it and clean it according to whatever disposition you find most possible, and let it be corrected by whatever skill you have: when it does not oppose you with a Vein or Nerve.
And know that incisors and Serrae for cutting these bones are many, according to the location of the bones, and their preparation, and their grossness, and their subtlety, and their magnitude, and their thinness, and their hardness, and their rarity. Therefore, you must prepare an instrument suitable for each species of operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the species of instrument with which you need to operate when you have a long study ahead. And the knowledge of the measures of this art is a testimony to the measures of diseases: for then you will find by yourself what is suitable for it from the instruments for every illness.
And I affirm to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you should place as examples of those on which you will operate, and the test by which you will verify others.
The Form of Another Serrae.
The Form of the Joints of the Razor. Let the head of this Razor be according to the form of the head of a stellar hammer: and its points be according to the form of the points of elischetfegi.
And it does not fit unless heads of sutures are rubbed with it when they are corrupted, or a wide and large mouth.
Forma maioris Rasorii.
Forma Rasorii lati.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concavitas.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.
Forma Rasorii alterius curvatae extremiatis.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis teneae.
This is similar to a Radius, and the extremity is like a Saw: exhibited in many places for the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod convenit ad rationem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.
Extremitas eius triangulata, acuarum est extremitatum.
It is made from India. And similarly, it is necessary that all which we have said be made from Rasorii, and Incisoriis, and Serris.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et serratura ossium.
The extremities putrefy, either from an external cause or an internal cause.
When therefore you have treated that corruption with medicinal cure, and the cure does not prove effective: and you see the corruption attack the limb, which is not stayed by anything, then it must be that you cut out that limb until where the corruption follows, so that the sick person may escape death through that or because the evil is greater than the defect of the member.
And the sign that this occurs is when the limb darkens until it rots: which fire has burned or decayed after discoloration: until that corruption is cut away to where the rot follows, and spreads throughout the entire body.
Therefore, when you make the incision for it, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the strike of certain venomous creatures: such as the marine scorpion, the viper, and the rattle snake, and similar ones.
If therefore the corruption or strike is in the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption to spread to the remainder of the hand.
And similarly if this happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption to spread until it reaches the forearm.
And if it invades to that extent, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
And if the corruption penetrates and you see it about the elbow: then death of the patient is near. And administer in addition to that from the cure, is the quantity virtue.
And similarly do for the foot, when corruption invades the digit, then cut it at one node: and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut the foot entirely. If it has ascended to the knee, then cut the thigh at the knee joint.
If corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy except dismissal and leaving the sick person to die.
And the method of cutting the limb, or sawing it, is to tighten the ligament below the part you wish to cut, and tighten another ligament above the site. And the attendant stretch one ligament downward: and stretch another ligament upward. And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with Spatulum wide until all the flesh is exposed. Then cut it or saw it.
And it must be that you place a linen cloth from all sides, and the saw does not touch the healthy site: and happen to the sick person an additional injury and a hot abscess.
If, however, an internal flow of blood occurs while working, then cauterize the site quickly: or place some blood-letting powders over it. Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with an appropriate ligament, and care for it until it is healed.
And I tell you what happens to a man in his foot, this being the same as what I tell you.
Which is because it happens in his foot as blackening, resembling the burning by fire: and that corruption first occurs on his toe until it began to affect the entire foot.
Therefore, the man treated himself, after he saw the corruption occur on his limb with the pain he discovered from its blackening: and it affected him at the joint, and he was cured.
And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred on his index finger.
Therefore, he came to me, and I tried to recover that flux by what I applied to his hand from medicines after cleansing his body: but the flux did not subside, and it began to affect another finger: until the corruption affected his hand.
Therefore, he called for me to examine his hand: and I did not want that, hoping for a recovery from the flux: and I even feared death for him at the incision on his hand. For the man's strength was above his misfortune.
Therefore, since he despaired of me, he returned to his native land: and he came back to me quickly because of this, and the entire hand was affected: and he was cured.
And I have included this narrative only as an aid in understanding what falls under the genus of this illness: and as a demonstration to show how it should be handled.
On the care of Sinus, and the quality of medicated enemas.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until a collection of sanious matter is formed: then it is broken or perforated, and what is within it exudes from it, leaving a void as if it were a vessel: and the skin above it is like a thin cloth: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, nor impresses upon bone, nor nerve, nor ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and is not named a Fistula: yet if the space is prolonged until corruption impresses upon one of these members, then it is called a Fistula or zuken.
And the care of it is to cut that skin completely away as if it were rolled off: and especially when it is thin like a cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
If, however, you suspect that the skin will adhere and does not result in that ultimate corruption: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then treat it with a medicated enema, and consider it as for a Sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor: then prepare the medicated enema with Egyptian medicine, which consists of vinegar, oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, and mix them in a vessel: and boil them over fire until the medicine turns red: and thicken it to the consistency of honey.
Then take what you need from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and use it to treat the Sinus with an enema: and plug its opening, and let the medicine remain in it for a duration of two hours.
Then extract it with expression: let it remain for days until the sinus is purified and the odor is removed.
And when it is irrigated with ash water, when this medicine is not at hand: and you should take ashes of vine branches or ashes from holm oaks, and pour water over it. Then apply it and irrigate with it until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor ash water, then irrigate it with water and honey, to which some crushed zinc has been added. Or irrigate it with a mixture of honey and wine, for honey has the property to purify and cleanse, while wine helps adhere to the sinus, especially when the wine contains excess astringency and dryness.
When you do this several times and are confident that the sinus corruption is removed, then irrigate it with something that causes flesh to regenerate in it.
And take from the dyafinicon plaster: dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine. Or irrigate it with certain medicines and other ointments whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
If the sinus opening is narrow, into which the irrigation tube will not fit: then enlarge it slightly with a ironawl. Or place a wick wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment in it until it expands.
And similarly, if the opening is even wide, then suture its edges together: and allow only the amount to enter that can be irrigated without additional material.
And similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is elevated, then dry it out in a lower place that is within it, so that the pus may flow downward; for when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated therein.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus below it as you wish: then try to prepare the flesh with a preparation by which the pus may flow from it easily according to its preparation. Try to prevent anything from being retained by the pus altogether: and take consolidating medicines which are applied over the mark, suitable for what you wish. And apply them on a linen cloth. And let the cloth be of such quantity that it may cover the entire sinus. Then cut with forceps directly into the opening of the sinus to make a hole, somewhat larger than the opening of the sinus. Then apply another cloth with a gentle ointment on it, according to the size of the hole: and place it far from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of the pus may be eased: and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days one by one.
That which is over the opening of the sinus, you should remove every hour so that what aggregates there from the pus may exit: and by this you will know whether what flows from it is much or little, whether it is digested or undigested.
And with this, again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether the lord thereof feels pain therein, or there is no pain, and whether there is an abscess therein, or there is not an abscess.
When therefore your medical treatment is thus extended, and you see the matter which comes out above the sinus orifice, then know that the sinus now adheres, or approaches adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then replace another pad, and renew the ointment.
If however the subtle poison comes out of the sinus after a long interval, then do not despair of adhesion, for its cure is approaching, since there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to this.
If however the foul pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its course is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, but let the doctors do it so that they are medicines in substance moist and in virtue dry: as with dyafinicon ointment when additional spina sindonis is added to it.
And from the very latest stage of its cure, take the dyafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle it over old wine that is equal in substance to it.
Then prepare it with it, and use it.
And now it performs a similar action when you do not have the dyafinicon ointment at hand, use honey until it thickens and use it. Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: dry the whole, and powder it over honey while it is on fire. Then draw a line over the cloth, and bind it above the sinew: and with the thread soaked in honey until it is saturated: and dust the surface with the powder, and place the cloth over it, and bind it.
And from time to time it is administered with long aristolochia, and the roots of celestial lily, and lily: and herb flour, and centaury. Use them simple or combined, wash them, and sieve them: and dust the honey as I have told you, and use it.
If the condition of the sinew prolongs and is not cured by this treatment: then know that there is deep corruption within it. It may have already made an impression in the bones, or in other hard parts, or in the ligaments. Then treat it with the cure for fistulas, as previously stated.
Regarding the care of fistulas, nail erosion, and incision of the finger, and excision.
A panaritm is an abscess that arises under the thumb nail, or the foot nail: and perhaps it arises in other digits.
When therefore the condition prolongs, and is neglected by its caretaker, and becomes an abscess with a hot abscess: or it corrupts, and emits pus until it eats into the nail root: and perhaps it corrupts the whole nail, and perhaps corruption reaches the bone until there is a foul odor: and the end of the finger swells, and its color darkens.
When therefore you cure it, using what we said in division and the treatment is not sufficient: then you must incise with a knife all the excess that remains from the nail. Then cauterize the wound after that. For the cautery is very useful.
If indeed the mouth is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the additional nails are already pressing the flesh towards the interior and begin to prick it and hurt it: then you should place Subtile Radium at an angle under the nail that pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards. Cut the flesh with facility, and place over what remains of the flesh from the burning and corrosive medicines until all of it is removed. Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the corruption, however, already encroaches on the mouth, then you must cut out that part of the mouth and remove it: for it is never cured while a corrupted mouth remains.
If you see the corruption advancing to the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints, according to the previous mention of it. Then treat it until it heals.
If there is, however, nail friction or impact, and severe pain occurs in it, then you should bleed the patient first. Then dry the nail with a sharp transverse section of Spathamille from top to bottom.
And beware that the section does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the patient and it will be a cause of additional flesh growth in that place.
Then care for the place with what alleviates pain.
But the additional digit that is born in some men's hands, perhaps it is wholly fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail on it: and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birthplace is in some knuckles. Therefore, the one that is born at the knuckles of the digit does not move: and the one that is born at the joint of the digit perhaps moves.
Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them, his section is easy. What you should do is to cut it at its root with Spatuli lato.
Therefore, the treatment for that which is born at the root of the joint is difficult. Therefore, do not cut it.
In that one which is born at the digit at the last knuckle, then you should cut the flesh of it with a round incision up to the bone. Then cut the bone with one of those bone-cutting saws that fits it. Then care for it until it heals.
Consolidation which happens to digits next to each other occurs often either from the person's birth (i.e., it is born with him), or from the healing of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar causes.
Therefore, you should cut away that consolidation until the digits return to their natural form. Then place among them licorice or cloths soaked in rose oil so that they do not heal quickly, and separate them from each other: or place among them a thin sheet of lead until the area hardens as required.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then dry that consolidation according to how it is prepared and fits the shape of the limb.
¶ Incision for Vitiatio.
Uites are veins wrapped up, thick, full of excessive melancholic fluid which affect many parts of the body: and they discharge most frequently in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk much, labor, or carry things.
Therefore, you should administer the excision of the body from black bile occasionally with a strong excision.
Then phlebotomize the patient and let the basilic vein flow.
The treatment of these with a steel instrument is according to two methods. Their vein is to be ligated, and black bile should be drawn out. And the other method is to elevate the vein and draw out all of it.
The section of this should be done according to this method. Anoint the leg first with warm water abundantly, until the thick, foul blood is resolved. Then tie the leg of the patient from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the knee with a ligature. Then sever the vein in one, or two, or three broad sections.
Then elevate, that is, draw off the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg to the top, and from the upper part it is necessary to incise the phlebotome for the sick first. Then sever the nail with its base: continue until a quantity of blood sufficient and as tolerated by the patient emerges.
Then ligate it: and instruct him to abstain from foods producing black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and this is harmful to the sick.
The elevation of it is to be done in this manner. Shave the leg of the patient if there are many hairs. Then immerse it in a bath: or apply warm embrocation with water to the leg until it reddens and the veins swell: or perform vigorous exercise if a bath is not available until the limb becomes warm.
Then dry the skin along the length of the vein section: or at its end near the knee, or at the lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with forceps, and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears to your senses: and at its appearance, you will see it reddening towards blackness. When it therefore flows out of the skin, you will see it white as if it were a string.
Then introduce the Radium beneath it until when it is elevated and comes out of the skin: suspend it with a blind hook gently.
Then dry the other section near that section with three fingers. Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears. Then elevate it with the Radium as you did, and suspend it with another blind hook as you did first.
Then dry the other section, or multiple sections if needed. Then elevate it, and cut the last section near the heel.
Then extract it to the section that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the section that is above, or all higher sections, until it comes out completely: then cut it.
If it does not comply with your extraction and elevation, then introduce a needle with a strong doubled thread, and ligate it, and extract it. Or introduce the Radium beneath it, and rotate your hand in all directions until it comes out. And be careful, lest it be cut. For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to elevate it greatly, and it enters the surrounding tissues causing harm.
When therefore you have extracted it completely, then place over the wound a piece of wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and care for it until it is healed.
If the Vine is contracted, having a tortuosity with a卷缩 towards parts, and is not as we said according to rectitude: then you must find over it for all parts of its tortuosity, and places of its卷缩.
Then suspend it with forceps until you lift it entirely: and beware at your cut above it not to pierce a vein or wound: for it will be difficult for you to lift or extract it. Therefore preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidendi qua sanatur Vitis.
Forma Vini caeci.
It does not have the same suppleness as other vines, nor is it acute at its extremity, so as not to wound a vein: and it is of great flexibility, being gentle: for if it were subtle, it would wound the vein with its subtlety: rather, its excess in thickness, as we said.
Of the Extraction of the Crural Vein.
This vein is generated in the legs in warm lands, such as Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, warm, tender lands, that is, in which no herbs nor trees are born.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as snakes and ascariasis worms occur within the body, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the onset of this vein's event is that a violent inflammation occurs in the thigh. Then the area is blistered. Then the Vein begins to emerge from that blistered area, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When therefore the extremity of it becomes apparent, then you should wrap a fragment of lead, whose weight is one third of a drachm, up to two drachms and the node itself, around it; and let the lead hang from the thigh.
Whenever therefore something emerges from it to the exterior, wrap that in lead, and mark it with the node. If it extends greatly, then cut a portion of it, and wrap the remainder. And do not cut it to its root until it has emerged entirely. For if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, causing an abscess, putrefaction, and a malignant ulcer to occur.
Therefore, it should be gently handled and drawn out gradually until it emerges from its last portion, and nothing of it remains in the body: in some people, this vein emerges to a length of five handbreadths and ten. And it has now arrived at me, for it emerged from the man to twenty handbreadths.
If however it occurs to you during your hour of medication: then insert a needle into its aperture, and perforate it with a long aperture, together with the body, until all that is in it from the matter is evacuated: and administer putrefaction to the place for several days with medicinal treatments. Then concern itself with the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle or in the foot itself: and it has many openings, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Therefore, treat it as we said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
¶ Concerning the section on worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bovine Illness.
This illness is called Bovine Illness in certain lands among us: for it often happens in cows, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it travels throughout the body, ascending and descending: and its presence is felt through the movement from limb to limb until it breaks through a spot in the skin and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors. Just as worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and ascarids, occur in the stomach.
And it is feared because of its malignity. Because when it travels through the body and rises to the head, and reaches a certain place, then perhaps it opens up there, emerges, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
When therefore you wish to treat it and extract it, then this can be done only through the movement of the worm and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore, you must tie what is above him and what is below him with a strong constriction ligature. Then dry above it, and extract it.
If it is deep in the flesh and you do not find it, then place above that place a cautery with fire until it dies.
And that which is greater than what is feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
If you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then tie below it the eyebrow with a good constriction. Then dry above it, and extract it.
And the patient should use for his purification medicines that dissolve putrid and bad fluids.
And let him beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ Concerning the incision for the illness Nakir.
This illness is called Nakir in our land: it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs and then changes from limb to limb.
And I have indeed seen it myself, as I am narrating to you. I was called to a sick woman in some vineyards. And she showed her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the brachium.
And after I remained for one hour, I saw one inflation move with speed, like a worm, ascending to his shoulder faster than can be: as is the case with live silver when it runs from place to place.
Therefore, the pain recessed from that place and fixed itself in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it moved into the remainder of the body until it reached the other arm.
Then it told me that it was rotating throughout its entire body, as I had seen.
I therefore marveled at the speed of its permutation from member to member. And I, before that, had not seen this illness move in my eyes in such a manner. However, I have seen many who find the pain move from member to member: and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think that to be the case except because the woman was among those who are from the dry body, where veins have been detected: hence this airiness is perceived to have moved.
And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and have humid bodies, where the veins are hidden.
When therefore you wish to effect its cure, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to your eye, as we have said, then bind above it and below it quickly, and draw off that constricted airiness above it, until the airiness exits: and cauterize the place.
If, however, you do not see it with your eyes: then cure it with the excision of the body, and with that which expels wind, and fumigate it with foul pills, and pills of serpentaria, and similar things.
¶ Of the Extraction of Arrows.
Arrows vary according to their kinds and according to the places at which they strike the body.
The diversity of these arrows is as follows: for some have large and small points, and others are concave and deaf. And some have three angles. And some have tongues. And some have barbs.
Those that fall upon the limbs vary according to two modes. For the limbs are either from principal concave parts, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar organs. For when it falls into any of these limbs, and you see signs of death, which I will narrate to you later, then it is necessary to perform the proper extraction from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions. And when you do not see these evil signs, and the arrow is not embedded deep in the limb, then extract it and care for the wound.
For when a dart falls into the brain and penetrates the nose and exits through what is above the brain, it results in: since these are caused by intense heat, scotoma, vertigo, redness of the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasm, confusion of understanding, and vomiting of choler. And perhaps blood emerges from the nostrils or ears. And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed. And from the place of the wound emerges a white moisture resembling pus. And what resembles the moisture of flesh exits from it.
If therefore you see these signs, then abstain from treatment, and extract the dart if it does not exit.
The signs of the dart when it falls into the heart are: for it is close to the left breast, and one feels as if it were fixed in a hard substance, not in a void. And perhaps the movement of the dart is similar to the pulse: and black blood flows from the wound. And follows that cold in the extremities, cold sweat, and syncope. Therefore, know that death descends without doubt.
And the sign of the dart when it wounds the lung is the exit of foamy blood from the wound: and the vessels that follow the neck become inflamed, and the color of the patient changes. And he exhales a great, high spirit: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
And if the arrow falls on the veil, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is a great panting with a vehement pain, with a sigh: and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls on the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the wound will be discharged.
And if the arrow falls on the Belly and is fixed therein: something of feces emerges from the wound, or that which is intestinal and already disrupted. Therefore, there is no hope in curing him, nor in extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow falls on the Bladder and urine emerges: and something proceeds from it to the external parts, and the pain is more severe upon the sick man: then know that it is fatal.
And the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, spout (possibly a surgical tool), assistant bone, vertebrae of the back, fork骨（可能是手术工具），助骨，脊椎，叉骨，和类似部位，根据不同的位置治疗：当箭没有找到动脉或神经，并且不是毒 arrow。
And I tell you what I have seen about these arrows, so that you may understand it for your treatment.
Because an arrow fell on the lacrimal apparatus of one man, at the root of the nose. Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, beneath the fatty tissue of his ear: and he was cured, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not find it except for its small end, with which it adheres to its wood: and the arrow was large among arrows of the Turcos, having soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was cured, and no evil happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from the throat of the Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it has ears. I cut it above the arrow between two guides: and it was already submerged in his throat. I extracted it carefully until I removed it: and the Christian was cured.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his abdomen: and we thought that he would die from it.
After thirty days had passed, and nothing changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow: and I extracted it with care: and he was cured, and no evil happened to him.
And I saw a man from whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound healed over it. After seven years had passed, an arrow emerged from the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman from whose abdomen an arrow had fallen, and the wound healed over it, and the arrow remained within her: and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man, to whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound had become consolidated, and remained, not finding him in great pain: and similar to these many.
And I extracted the arrow from one of the king's men, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already slightly declined to the right side: and the entire arrow was hidden.
I was therefore called to cure him after the arrow fell until three days. I found the arrow wound very deep.
I examined it with a fine probe and did not sense the arrow: and he himself found a puncture and pain on the side of his ear from the right. I hoped that this puncture was at the tip of the arrow.
I applied a plaster to the area with a plaster that had drawing and dissipating properties, and I trusted that the place would suppurate and show me a sign of the arrow, so that I could cut above it: and nothing happened in the place that would indicate that the arrow had reached it.
I applied a plaster to him daily for many days: and nothing happened, and the wound consolidated in the meantime: and he remained weak from the extraction for a space of days until he felt the arrow within his nose on a certain day. And he told me about it.
And he told me about it. I applied a sharp and corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened up: and when I probed it again, I felt the fine tip of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the incision of the wound by means of that sharp medicine until we visibly saw the extremity of the arrow, and it passed with it a space of time about four months.
Then, after the wound had been enlarged, and it was possible for me to introduce forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to extraction: then I ceased not to refine and devise methods for it until one day with properly made forceps, as their form is described at the end of this chapter, I extracted it. Then I restored the wound.
And the physicians indeed judge that the cartilage of the nose does not restore itself. Then I restored it, and the wound healed firmly, and the sick man was completely cured: nor did anything harm him at all.
And I tell you the quality of extracting certain arrows: so that you may establish a rule and definition for what I did not say.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not included in the narration: nor does the book encompass it, and a skilled artisan compares it with a little more and a little less: and with that which is present, to that which is absent: and he finds a new operation and a new instrument at the descent of matters foreign to this art when they occur.
I say that arrows do not exit from the parts where they are fixed unless according to two modes. Or through attraction from the place whence it entered. Or from the opposite side.
And that which comes out where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place: and is drawn out, and comes out.
And if it does not respond to the exit at the time it falls: then it is necessary to let it alone for a few days until the flesh around it putrifies. And the drawing out and its exit should be alleviated.
And similarly, if it is embedded in bone, and does not respond to your efforts for exit, then let it alone for a few days: and repeat it with drawing and motion every day until it comes out.
And if it does not respond to your efforts for exit after days, then it is necessary to perforate around the arrow in the bone from every side with a sharp probe until the arrows swell. Then draw it out, and extract it.
If the arrow has already hidden in the body and is concealed from sensation: then seek it out and probe. If you feel it, then draw it out with instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
If you cannot draw it out due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow deep within: and there is no hole, nor nerve, nor vein there: then cut above it until the wound expands, making it possible to extract the arrow.
If there are ears through which it is held, then free the flesh fixed therein from every side with all skill you can, and use other methods. If this cannot be done by freeing the flesh through a puncture in the ear, then distort the ear until the arrow emerges.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow in any place, then use the distortion of your hand with forceps on all parts until you make it emerge: and with utmost subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and the attraction and extraction become difficult for you.
If you cannot extract it in one attempt, then leave it for a few days until the tissue around it becomes putrefied. Then repeat the procedure: for it will become easier with the putrefaction. If however, it causes contrary effects such as a blood flow, then apply what we have said in the cure chapter of its section, and guard your strength from cutting the vein, or nerve, or cord.
And administer the skill in every way that is possible to thee for the discharge of the Arrow: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or tardiness, and firmness, as I have told thee.
And thou shalt do it when drawing the Arrow, so that it be weak according to the figure, according to which it was at the time of the fall of the Arrow. For it is more advantageous. If, however, this is not possible for thee, then administer what is possible for thee from the figures.
The Arrow which comes out from the opposite part of the other, or has proceeded from it to the exterior: causes a gibbosity at the end of the Arrow by a sense from the neighboring skin above, and thou seest it projecting. Therefore cut above it, and let the cut be according to the quantity that the forceps can grasp in it.
Then draw it out: for it becomes easy to extract.
If, however, it is retained in the bone, then twist thy hand according to the roundness until the Arrow presses into the bone and enlarges itself: then draw it out.
And if not, let it alone for a few days, then repeat it until it comes out.
If the wood of the Arrow is in it, then push it out with it.
If the wood has fallen off, and thou wishest to administer a push: then introduce into it a concave instrument, so that its concavity enters the fletching of the Arrow: then push it out with it.
If the arrow is concave, then drive it with an instrument entering into itself. The arrow will be extracted through this.
If the arrow is poisoned, then one must extract all the flesh in which the poison is located: if it is possible for you to do so. Then treat it with what is suitable for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near because you can feel it when you probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut and be careful of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then dress the wound if you see it, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the extremities be similar to the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp over the arrow, they do not let go of it.
And many species of forceps are made, large and small, and those of medium size, according to the size and thickness of the arrow, and the width and tension of the wound.
The form of the driving instrument for concave arrows.
And the form of the driving instrument for blunt arrows.
This is the blunt arrow's extremity, like a radius, so that it can enter into the concave arrow and be driven with it.
¶ On Phlebotomy of Veins.
Veins to be phlebotomized, of which custom runs in the body, are thirty.
From which in the head are sixteen: two Pulsatiles veins, which are behind the ears and called the two Herbae: and two Arteries, which appear in the two temples: and two veins which are in the two lacrimal glands of both eyes, which are called Aspicientes: and one vein prepared in the middle of the forehead: and one vein which is at the tip of the nose. And two Guidegi, which are in the neck. And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two veins which are in the lower lip. And these are the veins called Algecherich. And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins to be phlebotomized in the arms are five veins in each arm.
One of them is Cephalica, and it is from the side of the tree (or wood): and the common people call it the vein of the head. And Fusca. And it is the Median vein, and it is composed of the basilicon branch and the cephalic branch: and the common people name it the body vein. And the basilicon, and it is placed on the domestic side: and it is also named titillaris. And the common people name it the vein of the belly. And the brachial vein, and it is placed above the basilicon: and that is the one in which phlebotomy is performed, and that is the one which appears above the thumb when examined clearly.
And Saluatella: and it is a vein which is between the annular and the smallest: and it has two branches.
And in the thigh and in the foot there are three veins. One of them is the vein which is below the curvature of the thumb from the Sylvian side. And the second is the Saphena: and its location is near the heel from the domestic side. And the vein Nesse: and its location is near the heel from the Sylvian side.
And in the thigh there are three other veins similar to them.
¶ On phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomy of the two veins behind the ears is helpful for old catarrhs, hemigraine, sahafati, and old maladies of the head.
And the quality of phlebotomy for these veins is as I narrate. And it is that the head of the sick person should be shaved, and the back of his head, at the place of the two veins, should be rubbed with a rough cloth in good friction. Then the sick person should tie his neck with a band until the two veins become apparent. And the places of these veins are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head. Seek out these veins with your finger, and where you feel the pulse of the veins beneath your finger, mark those places with cauterization.
Then take the cutting bloodletting knife, which is called Incidens. Then insert it under the vein in the skin until the bloodletting knife reaches the vein. Then raise your hand with the vein and skin向上，並在皮肤與静脉处切开一个切口。 And the length of the cut should be about two joined fingers, or approximately that. And let the blood flow out as much as you desire.
Then tie it with sutures and leave it alone until it heals.
And the cutting and cauterization of these have already been described at the beginning of the book.
Of the two arteries that are in the two temples, bloodletting is beneficial for ancient migraine: and for severe headache, and for continuous inflammation affecting the eyes.
And the quality of bloodletting is according to what I narrate to you. The sick man should draw his neck much taut, until two veins become clearly apparent to the eye: and their pulse will be demonstrated by pressing with your finger. Then the signs shall appear with the application of encaustic.
Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and introduce the lancet coming from below, and lift the vein upwards. And cut it, as you did with the other two veins: and let the blood flow according to the quantity needed.
Then release the constriction of the sick person, and place your finger on the vein for one hour. Then place the cloth and pillows over it, and apply a strong constriction from above: and remove the constriction until it is healed.
And the mention of these, and their cutting, and their extraction, has already been made at the beginning of the book.
The interval for the bloodletting of the frontal vein is after cephalic bloodletting, for old facial ailments: and for hemigraine, and rubefaction: and for foul sores.
And the quality of this bloodletting is according to what I narrate to you. The sick person should draw his neck with a string, until the vein becomes apparent. Then take the instrument called Fossorium.
Place a prominent point on the head of the Fossorium over the vein, and strike it with a plectrum or with another object in a similar manner: and allow the blood to flow according to the quantity you wish. Then release the perforation in the sick person and bind it tightly until it is healed.
And when it is opened with a broad phlebotome. Indeed, it is not appropriate for the phlebotome to have a sharp end, as do the other phlebotomes; rather, it should have a broad end. And open the vein using the phlebotome by turning it: for the opening is close by. And perhaps the phlebotome will break when it is thin.
The ligature of the two veins that are in the lacrimal areas of the two eyes is for scabies and rubedine: it binds in the eye and for facial illnesses.
And the quality of phlebotomy for this is that the sick person should bind his neck with a bandage. Then puncture these veins: and stand over his head.
And make the phlebotome puncture slightly along its length using a small, broad phlebotome, for there is no flesh in that area. If the phlebotomy is of a fine extremity, perhaps it will break.
Then cause to run out the blood that is necessary for you. And place cloths over them, and tighten them overnight, and release them.
The veins of Nasi for phlebotomy are applied to a acute fever, a severe sciatica, and diseases of the face, such as hemigraine and rubescence that occurs on the face: particularly when it is old.
And the quality of the phlebotomy for this is that the patient will tighten his neck. Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a fine, long phlebotomy needle: and insert it in the middle of his nose, between the part that distinguishes the nostril according to its straightness. Since the veins do not appear to touch, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And you should hold your hand with the phlebotomy needle slightly back: and cause the blood to run out according to your necessity. Then ligate it overnight. It will recover quickly.
The phlebotomy of the veins Guidegi is useful for the constriction of shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, melancholic illnesses, impetigo, and malignant sores, as well as by corroding agents, that is, herpetic affections.
And the quality of those phlebotomies is that the sick person should be stretched under both sides of his neck with a ligature: and let the craftsman stand over the head of the sick person, and let the sick person sit on a seat.
Then perform a venous phlebotomy of greater length briefly. Then draw an appropriate quantity of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for that. Then do the same from the other vein.
Then release the ligature, and tie the two veins with a tight ligature in the middle: so that the sick person does not suffocate. And let her remain thus until morning. For the wound is healed.
¶ Concerning venous phlebotomy for Algeberich. Veins for phlebotomy in Algeberich are beneficial: because they contribute to alcoholism in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and bad sores, and cracks in the lips, and bad sores, even those in the nose and around it.
And the quality of these phlebotomies is that you make the sick person sit before you and tie his neck with a ligature. Then roll back the lip and look at the two veins: one is on the right side of the lip, and the second on the left side. The demonstration of both is through their blackness. And that is true: because around them are small black veins. Therefore cut with both cuts intersecting.
If there is any doubt about them, and you do not know which one it is: then direct your attention to the larger cut, and make it more evident.
And similarly do this with two veins in the upper lip: and indeed the custom greatly favors this: and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ Concerning Phlebotomy of the Vein under the Tongue after Phlebotomy of the Cephalic Veins. Of the two veins which are under the tongue, the benefit of phlebotomy is that the phlebotomy of the cephalic veins is for prefactions which are in the throat, and ulceration of the tongue, and diseases of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomy for these is that the sick person should sit between your hands in the sun: and elevate his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side for one vein, and on the other side for another vein: and the color of both should incline to blackness.
Therefore cut both veins: and watch that you do not place your hand too deeply in cutting them. For beneath them are arteries, and perhaps there may be a flow of blood from those arteries.
The three veins which are cut in the elbow are those for which the custom of phlebotomy has run in all men.
And phlebotomy of them is done according to two modes. Or by puncturing with a phlebotomizing myrtle rod: or by olive oil to cause subsidence: or by cutting with a phlebotomizing surgical knife, and this is Alnesil. And this is its form.
And there are broad and fine species according to the width of the veins and their tension. The form of the phlebotomizing myrtle should be broad, as you can see. And it is suitable for opening concave, full, flowing, visible, large veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy is of lesser width and more fine at the points.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of fine veins, which contain thin yellow blood.
Basilicae, which is one of these three venous phlebotomies, is a remedy. Because it draws blood from diseases that are below the throat and neck, following the chest and abdomen. It is suitable for a phlebotomist to use this along with a phlebotomy needle, being careful, as there is an artery beneath. If therefore it errs and adds a puncture of the phlebotomy needle, it will hit that artery, and there will be a flow of blood. Therefore, it is necessary not to use a puncturing phlebotome on it; instead, use a cutting one according to Alnesil.
That being said if the basilica does not appear in a clear manifestation, then it is necessary to remove it yourself, and exchange it for another, or seek some branch thereof: or use a phlebotome in place of it on the arm. For it is clear and cut with a phlebotome according to Anesil, as we have said.
If you wish to perform a phlebotome on the same, then it is necessary to first press the arm to find the location, until you recognize the pulse point. Then mark the location with cauterization, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using a phlebotome according to Alnesil, as we have said. And be careful that the strike does not fall outside the space from the artery's location.
And when you see that, upon tightening the ligature, there is swelling at the location you marked with cauterization, then that swelling is due to the artery: avoid it accordingly.
And if you see blood spurting at the phlebotome as urine from a boy, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the artery. Therefore, act quickly, and place your finger over that space for a while, then remove your finger. If therefore blood is cut (for it is cut many times), then press the arm, and release it. Be careful of the patient from its motion, and let him be fearful of it.
And let it not be moved for a few days until it is healed.
If the blood does not drain and overcomes you, and there is no medicine at your moment of need, then cut the artery if it appears to you. For its extremities are drawn together, and the blood is drained.
Or take a strip of leather and cut it: take one half and tie it over the place where the vein is constricted, with a ligature and small knots until another day.
Then if the blood is drained, it is good. And if not: then take care of it with him from whom the mention preceded regarding the place where the powder is absciss and stops the flow of blood. The draining of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions because of the location of the small wound and the possibility of ligating from the arm.
The blue veins are useful for phlebotomy, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomist that this vein be above the fear of harm from phlebotomy, for beneath it is a nerve. If therefore he adds to the puncture of phlebotomy and finds a nerve, it happens that there is a stupor in it, and the healing of it becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not cured at all.
And this nerve often appears to the sense. If, however, it is hidden in some people and is fine and not visible, then you must make your incision where you would phlebotomize it, the section with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
If the vein is between two nerves, then incise the vein lengthwise.
Of the Cephalic Vein. Phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and contributes to the treatment of eye ailments.
And it is proper to use this vein for phlebotomy by puncturing it with an olive-phlebotome or a myrtle-phlebotome, because it is safer than all other veins, since it is neither an artery nor a nerve.
However, it is fitting for you during phlebotomy to avoid the head of the limb with the olive-phlebotome and seek a milder place: and it does not harm him if it is not found on the first strike, so that it may be repeated over it with phlebotomy several times.
However, perhaps an abscess may form in some people if it is not phlebotomized on the first strike, but that abscess does not harm him in any way.
Of the Utility of Phlebotomy and Precautions to Be Observed. The quality of phlebotomy, and the accidents arising from it, which you should consider in its correction.
First, therefore, you must know of that which should be understood, namely that phlebotomy is not administered, except for the conservation of health, and its perseverance, and caution from the advent of illness.
And that phlebotomy be made in one of the three veins which are in the cubit, namely Cephalica, and Fusca, and Basilica. And that phlebotomy be made at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in spring, and summer: in autumn, and winter after eating, when signs of excess appear.
And phlebotomy be made on the first day, or on the third day, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomy which is administered in illnesses does not have a fixed hour: but when provoked by convenience and necessity, it may be done at night, or during the day, and at any hour, and at any time.
And it is not advisable to perform phlebotomy on children until they reach fourteen years of age. Nor shall phlebotomy be performed on a pregnant woman, except from the fourth month until the seventh. Nor shall phlebotomy be performed on seniors who have already surpassed sixty years of age.
When therefore someone wishes to be phlebotomized for any reason, it must be that he purges his intestines before phlebotomy with a mild enema if there is much retained feces, so that the veins at the time of phlebotomy do not draw harmful putrid excesses from the intestines into the body's main organs.
Neither is a patient with tōctina, that is, satiety with nausea, bloodlet; nor one who is overfed, nor one who has expelled from intoxication, until that is removed from them. Neither is a patient with hydropsy.
And caution be taken that bloodletting not be performed again after a colic attack, vomiting, diarrhea, multiplication of intercourse, labor, exercise, watchfulness, fasting, and all that dissolves virtue from the body or animal.
Then consider in subtlety of humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks and medicines: if it is possible for him to do that.
Then he should enter the bath if nothing forbids it; or he should exercise some exercise, that the blood may be subtletized.
And let his bloodletting be in the chest on the third day, as we said: and try that his breast be evacuated of all such evils on that day: as stricture, and anger, and fear: and of all bodily accidents, as labor, pain, excess of intercourse, and like things.
And let there be present at his seat things of whose use custom among men has been established from their aroma, fragrance, and pleasure, and the like through the quantity possible.
Then let the bloodletter sit on a stool that is higher than the stool for bloodletting. Afterward, he should extend his arm and the bloodletter should rub it twice or three times with his hand. Then tie the ligament with forceps, and wrap it twice.
And let the ligature be tight适度些，因为当结扎不均匀，或是因过紧，都会阻碍血液的流通；若是过松，则同样会阻碍血液的流通。
Then after the ligature, let the phlebotomist rub his hands together briskly until the veins become engorged and can be felt.
Then let the phlebotomist cleanse the puncture site with a little old oil.
Then let the phlebotomist place his index finger of his left hand on the vein at the site where he intends to perform the phlebotomy, lightly: so that the vein does not slip and the strike is accurate. For the vein is like astringent when you find it as it flees at the phlebotomy. And some veins are full of wind: and when you place the lancet on it, it contracts under the lancet, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the lancet does not open the vein. If it does open the vein, it is too tight. Therefore, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and diligent in all these matters.
Then let the phlebotomist remove the lancet. If therefore the vein opens with one stroke, then it is good. And if not, then repeat the stroke with another lancet below that place lightly, or above it with dispatch: so that the site does not become inflamed.
If the inflammation subsides or the patient improves, then discharge him on that day or the following two days: and do not tightens the bandage. For perhaps it will draw a hot abscess. He should not enter the bath.
Then he may repeat the bloodletting if he wishes.
If the opening is small, or the blood flows slowly: and fear that not enough blood may escape: then repeat the bloodletting at the same opening according to its exact position, and add a little in the procedure.
And do that with haste before the area inflames: for the inflamed area often occurs in many people following a small procedure.
If you therefore see the area already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure over it at all, for nothing excuses you in this. And apply something from the oil to the area: for it will facilitate the flow of blood. And it is better in this case than pure oil and than other oils.
And similarly administer the oil feces in every bloodletting where you need to let the veins flow freely: and they do this with Tyriaca Alfarach and Sagzenea when applied from one of them to the area.
Blood thickens and solidifies when it is coarse.
If a large abscess occurs at the site of bloodletting, for this often happens, especially to those who are bled only twice a year, or if the vein opening is small, then act quickly and apply a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated slightly, to the area: and keep it tight for one hour, for it will dissolve.
And you should do this after the blood has exited the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein.
And if after several days there remains in the place some blackness or greenishness, that is not harmful; and if you wish, apply something of aloes, or myrrh dissolved: or something from the juice of mint, that is, horehound, or similar to that.
And indeed, blisters and swellings often occur after phlebotomy at the Basilica.
And place your hand upon it, then if you find it soft upon pressing with your hand, then that swelling is bad. Therefore, be careful to apply something of what we have said. For perhaps blood from the artery is flowing from it.
But make a poultice for it with what we have said, which contains styptic substances, so that the area may harden. Then attend to it with the rest of the treatment until it is cured.
And you should draw blood from every person according to the strength of his virtue. And what is apparent from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it be allowed to exit until it becomes red: and similarly, if you see it thick, let it be allowed to flow until it becomes thin: and similarly, if it is sharp, let its sharpness be removed.
And it must be that one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting by means of a single process, that the phlebotomy of the vein be augmented, and let the phlebotomy be broad: and in him who is weak, let it be contrary to his.
And it must be that the extraction occurs alternately, and that the aperture be narrow: and better in a venous phlebotomy is a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this mode of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and from cutting the nerve: and it is more commendable and safer than a phlebotomy by width and length.
And for one to whom it is accustomed to come upon collapse at phlebotomy, it must be that he takes food before phlebotomy with a small infusion of pomegranate juice in water: or dry mulberry, if it is heated: and extract from him in three alternations, or four, by bloodletting.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread infused in pomegranate syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup, or in fragrant syrup flavored with spices.
And if collapse occurs at phlebotomy, and the cause of its death is the loss of much blood, then it must be that he takes in his drink water of meat and fine fragrant syrup: and use aromatic substances with aloe and daub his breast with them: and use all that we have said in the division in the chapter on collapse from evacuation.
And whoever wishes to treat his arm and let his blood the second time: it must be that for him whose phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and his strength is weak, he let his blood gradually according to the quantity of his strength over continuous days.
Whoever wishes to evacuate his arm and release his blood for the second time, and his body is strong: then let him do this seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite side of the part on which it declines: it should be evacuated for him on the second or third day.
In whose body the blood is already much heated and sharpened and causes a fever: it should be evacuated from him in one bleeding, and a large quantity of blood should be drawn from him. The opening should be increased until syncope occurs: after you have preserved all the conditions of phlebotomy, and you place your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur instead of syncope. For this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and acts negligently.
And it is not advisable when you wish to evacuate the arm and release blood for the second time, if the vein's opening has already closed, and the exit of the blood becomes difficult, so that it must be pressed upon with frenzy and the incision extended quickly. For that is very evil; indeed, leave it until it is bled for the second time.
Or remove with the sharpness of the lancet that which has coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place something of dissolved salt on it. And place something on it from tyriaca, alfarroba, or sagzenea, and keep it with a gentle compression until the blood flows.
If the vein is indeed an apostema, then leave it alone and do not puncture it until the apostema settles.
If necessity prompts to bleed the second time, and there is no excuse, then either perform phlebotomy at that same place, or on another arm in some other vein.
The vein of the arm is phlebotomized at the location of Fuscæ and Basilicæ, when they are not found and are occult, because it is composed of them.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that the sick person should place his hand in warm water until it turns red, and the vein should become apparent.
Then tie it above with a ligature with only slight constriction in the middle. Then perform the phlebotomy diagonally, not laterally, nor along its length: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such as you make it over the joint of the hand slightly.
If the exit of blood is prohibited, then place the hand in warm water again, and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your necessity.
If you are in summer days, then you may excuse yourself from placing the hand in warm water again. And the blood flows abundantly into warm water during winter.
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than that of all other veins, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy of the Saluatella of the right hand is applied to ailments of the liver.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you draw the mahason of the hand with a ligament, or with your own hand, after which you insert it into hot water until the vein becomes flexible and clearly demonstrated to the senses. Then perform the phlebotomy by crossing it. And if you puncture it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
And preserve, lest you withdraw your hand with the phlebotomy. For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Then repeat the hand over hot water, and allow the blood to flow into it. For if you do not repeat it in hot water, the blood will coagulate at the opening of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
When therefore you have drawn from the blood the quantity necessary, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not congeal quickly.
And similarly, you should do this with every rigid branch.
The ligature for the phlebotomy of the Saluatella from the left hand is: because it is applied to ailments of the spleen. And similarly, do this in the phlebotomy of the other branch, just as you did in the second equally.
The ligature for the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for ailments in the lower part of the body, such as uterine disorders, retention of menstruation, kidney diseases, and old sores of the thighs and legs, and similar ailments.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the sick person should place his foot in hot water and make friction over it until the veins swell, and ligate above the foot's joint with a blade. And the veins are located near the heel, apparent opposite the big toe: and they branch from there into the face of the foot with many branches.
Therefore phlebotomize her in a larger branch of it, or near the heel at its confluence: for it is better and safer.
If you phlebotomize it on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the face of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy through it as if you wish to cut into it, and call the phlebotomy Nesil.
If the exit of the blood is prohibited, then immerse his foot in hot water again: and allow the blood to flow into it until it is evacuated.
If the vein is missed in the first attempt, then repeat with phlebotomy to the upper parts slightly, for the location is safe, and you should not fear any harm from it, provided you beware of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the Saphena vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel from the side of the tree (i.e., the outer side).
And the benefit of his phlebotomy is for pain in the hip when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is such that the sick person should enter a bath and hurry. Bind the leg from the side of the anchor up to four digits above the heel with a thin, long cord: for it does not appear otherwise due to this.
When therefore it appears, then phlebotomize it according to whatever skill is possible for you, or by transversion: it is better, either by making an incision, or by cutting it with a section. For its place is safer, and it is hidden to many people.
For its place is safer, and it is hidden to many people. And if you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the senses: then phlebotomize some branch of it, and that one is the one that appears on the back of the foot and towards the ear: and beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood flow that you wish.
Then release the bandage, and place skin over the phlebotomy site, and bind the area. For it is quickly cured.
¶ On Ventosation and the quality of its use.
Vented diseases arise from horns, and from air, and from glass.
And ventosation is performed according to two methods. When with scarification and bloodletting: and the other is ventosation without scarification.
And this ventosation which is without scarification is performed according to two methods. For it is with fire. Or it is without fire.
And those ventosae which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places of the body. Of which one is Ventosatio Alnocrati and is the last part of the head; and Alkehel, and is in the middle of the neck; and ventosae Alhagdahim, and are two laminae of the neck from both parts simultaneously; and ventosae menti, and is under the mandible in the lower lip; and ventosae duarum spatularum; and ventosae Alachosos above the end of the tail; and ventosae duorum focilium, and are in the middle of the two arms; and ventosae duorum crurium; and ventosae duarum cauillarum.
And ventosae indeed does not draw blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this reason, its virtue does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy. Nor should ventosation be administered with or without fire when any diseases arise from congestion until the entire body is evacuated.
If necessity prompts us to administer ventosation due to the disease or for the sake of custom, we may do so at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month, and at any time.
That is because there are people who, when the blood increases in them to a point where its extraction through ventosation is needed, find heaviness and soreness in their head.
And among them is one who finds congestion and reddening on his face, head, and neck. And among them is one who finds itching on his face, forehead, and darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
And among them is one who cuts the place of his flatulence. And among them is one whose laughter is increased. And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth; or his tongue swells, and he吐血。 And among them is one whose sleep is increased. And among them is one who sees in his sleep blood and reddening, and slain persons, and wounds, and things similar to these.
When therefore we see something from these, and properly it is in the middle of the third week: then we order flatulence to occur after two or three hours have passed from the day.
The jawium for flatulence of the neck is: because it contributes to heaviness in the head, and what is discharged into the eyes. And indeed it should be at that time after the evacuation of the entire body.
And this indeed is flatulence in place of cranial phlebotomy.
And it is not permissible for one who has a cold constitution or one in whom there is a catarrh to use this. Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.
And for this reason, it is not advisable for seniors to use them, and in whose head there are cold diseases.
He who becomes an assiduous user of it, will experience forgetfulness.
And for this reason, you should instruct the Ventosator to lower his hand with the ventosa slightly on the inferior parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio or Alkehel is in place of phlebotomiae Fuscae and phlebotomiae Basilicae, and for this reason, it causes asma, constriction of breathing, fissures of the instrument causing breathing difficulties, and coughing, and repletion.
And it is necessary to apply the ventosa Alkehel slightly upwards, for if placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio alhagdahim, however, causes headaches, ophthalmia, hemigraine, perforation, and toothache: and it is in place of phlebotomiae Basilicae.
And you should instruct the Ventosator not to apply his hand with the scarification tool: to avoid hitting an artery and causing a blood flow.
Ventosatio, however, applied under the chin, causes caries in the mouth, and gingival decay, and similar conditions from diseases of the mouth: and it takes the place of phlebotomiae alieherich, which are applied to the two lips.
The ventilation of spatulas, is conveyed to the alchafafa, which is made from folding and heating.
The ventilation of the internal parts of two focilium, confers aid to phlebotomy of three veins, Basilicae, and Fuscae, and Cephalicae: for it draws blood from all those minute veins which are in the flesh: and those minute veins draw from other veins more gross than they, until the drawing reaches the three veins.
And it must be ordered to the Ventosator that he does not proceed too much in scarification, for the place is stripped of flesh, and beneath are nerves and arteries.
The Ventosa which is ventilated over the alchausos confers to hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
And it must be ordered to the Ventosator that the Ventosa be large and made of air, for the place requires a strong suction, and perhaps the fine Ventosas will break: and scarification should be done with a large incision.
The Ventosas for the legs reduce manifest diminution by drawing blood from the whole body, and they confer pain to old ailments in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder: they provoke menstruation, and cause bothorrheal discharges and ademenula: and they stand in place of phlebotomies of the two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Indeed, they greatly weaken the body and cause syncope to occur in many people.
And the aid of Ventosas alhorcobeni is close to the aid of Ventosas of two legs.
The quality of the position of the ventosae is that you shall place the ventosae first in the empty space, and draw them by a moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the ventosae, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, that the fluids may come to an equal place at the time of their arrival: and do not cease repeating this and continuing until you see the place already reddening and inflating, and the redness of blood appears: then therefore make a cut, and iterate suction gradually. Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
For he who is of tender flesh and has few pores should be incised but once, not more, lest the place ulcerate.
And command the ventosator to enlarge the incision and deepen it slightly: and regulate the suction for ease, speed, and gentle movement.
If there is thickness in the blood, then you should incise it twice. In the first incision, a way is opened for the subtlety of blood and its moisture: and in the second, for the thorough probing and extraction of thick blood.
If the blood is exceedingly foul, then make a third incision: so that the ultimate result may be achieved.
And for the ultimate purpose, when we wish to draw blood gradually or slightly, one incision is sufficient. If we wish to extract much blood, we incise with multiple cuts.
And if we measure and find the blood to be thick, then it is necessary to incise deeply. The equal limit in an incision is the depth of the skin.
What is that which should be administered from oils during the positioning of Wind-making, and what the wind-maker should beware of.
In that case where the skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are constricted, it should be anointed with places for Wind-making using opening oils, soothing oils, resolving oils: if it is in the time of summer, as is olive oil, or infused oil, or almond oil, or cucumber seed oil.
And if it is in the time of winter, then almond oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or syrup: and similar substances.
If the excess is large and cold, then use bitter almond oil, or balsamic oil, or white almond oil, or eucalyptus oil: and similar substances.
If the wind-maker is of large pores and tender flesh, then it should be prevented from oils, and they should wash the places for Wind-making after Wind-making with rose water, or cold water, or solar water, or cucumber water, or purslane water: and similar substances.
He, however, whose blood is of much moisture, should wash Wind-making places with vinegar, or myrtle water, or sumac: and similar substances.
Whose excesses are large, should wash his Wind-making places with old wine, or samsuc water, or eucalyptus decoction, or chamomile decoction: and similar substances.
And it should be noted that Wind-making should be done in a bath, or in the place where the bath was, or it should be administered after exiting the bath for one hour, or two hours.
And one should not sleep after a ventilation.
What is required to be observed before ventilation or phlebotomy.
And after that, one should consider first: if the ventilation or phlebotomy is choleric, and the acidity and inflammation overpower the blood, then it ought to receive cooling substances, such as pomegranate juice, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and celeriac, and julab: and similar things.
And set his foods as tender meats and those of sheep sekebiget, and pickled foods with herbs: and similar things.
And for one who has a cold complexion, he should take in drink a syrup made from honey, or from aloes, or else celeriac made from seeds: and let him take medium-scented wine, which is between old and new: and it should be ordered that he eat in small quantity. And set his foods as tender meats and canned beef: and nestling birds, that is, small birds: and nestlings of pigeons.
And it ought to be that the drink on the day of ventilation and phlebotomy is more than food: and in some people it should be given in drink at Tyrian hours alfaroch, or a medicine from musk, that is, mace, or allspice before ventilation: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood thinned. And it ought not to be taken in drink heated up.
Of Suctions Without Scarification. Suctions which are without scarification, are those applied to the hip, and spleen, and foot, and to the abdomen, navel, and regions of the kidney, and scrotum: for these parts do not bear scarification upon them.
And they are not sought through them except by contact from a blood vessel to another part: as we apply Suction to the breasts in the disease of nasal bleeding. And we use them so that we may induce cold and dense suction in the limb from a part: as we apply Suction to the abdomen and navel. For it rarifies the limb and heats it, and removes pain therefore, because it resolves that suction.
And it is also applied to the kidneys when obstruction or stone occurs there. By its virtue of attraction, it perhaps opens the obstruction or removes the stone from its place.
And similarly it does so when applied to the hip and spleen during suction treatment for both of them.
And these Suctions are administered with vacuums after merely cutting. And sometimes they are administered with the use of fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in diseases of the pleura: and this is done so that the Suction cup may be filled and contain a large amount of warm water, or water in which herbs suitable for the condition have been decocted.
Forma ventosae administratae cum igne.
Let the size of its opening be two fingers wide, as we have formed it: and its length in depth be the half of a palm: and let there be a small hole on its side at about the middle place thereof, according to the size that a needle will enter into it: make it from copper or brass, large bordered ones, thin ones, equal ones, polished ones: so as not to hurt the member in its position upon it: and let there be a rod across its middle from copper or iron whereon the candle with fire is placed.
And now this large suction cup is made, greater than that which we have narrated, and only slightly smaller than the other, according to the illnesses and age of him who uses it.
For the suction cups of children and slender individuals are different from those of adults and people with larger bodies.
The quality of placing this suction cup with fire on the member is to light a wick with fire from linen cloth decently, or a small candle made of tallow: and place it in the middle of the rod across which is in the middle of the suction cup: so that the fire burns at about the lower part of the suction cup, so as not to burn the sick person.
Then it is placed on the member: and the finger is placed over the hole as I said, until when we hold the suction cup: when needed, remove the finger, and the vapor will escape through that hole, and the suction cup will release immediately.
Then place the wick over the fire according to its size, and repeat if you need to do so.
In ventosa, however, which is administered in the illness of pleuritis, there is no cross rod, nor a hole: and it is not administered unless it is filled with water and placed only on the limb.
And this is its form.
And this ventosa is better the more it is large so that it can hold much water.
¶ Concerning the Suspension of Sanguisugae.
Sanguisugae are not administered in many cases, except where the application of ventosas to the limbs is impossible due to their thinness, such as the lip, gums, and similar areas. Or on a limb that is bare of flesh, such as the finger, nose, and similar areas.
And the quality of using them is: to use the sanguisugae that are in sweet and clean waters, free from corruption.
Then they should be left in water overnight and during the day until they become flaccid, and nothing remains in their interiors. Then the body should be evacuated first with phlebotomy and with ventosas. Then cleanse the limb of the patient until it becomes reddish. Then place them on it.
When therefore they are filled and fall, and it is possible to draw blood with the ventosa, then it is more effective for healing. And if not, then cleanse the area with vinegar. Then, after much water, and it is rubbed and pressed.
If the course of the blood is prolonged after the fall of Sugardrops, and this is exuding: then pour a linen cloth into cold water, and place it above, until the exuding stops.
If the blood multiplies, then powder zegi ground up, or galls and similar from styptics, until the blood stops.
Or place halves of peeled beans on the spot, and let them remain until the beans adhere to the spot, for the blood stops.
And it is necessary that if the administration of Sugardrops is required, when possible, to change them.
If the Sugardrops are prohibited due to suspension, then the area should be cleansed with fresh blood. Or prick with a needle in the area until something comes out from the blood. Then they should be placed, for they adhere immediately to something from the blood when they sense it.
When you wish for them to fall, powder something like ground aloes, or salt, or ashes over them: and they will fall immediately.
This Chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of Medicine, and is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations in bones.
Know, my Sons, that the foolish physicians and the common people boast of this Chapter, and those who have never examined an ancient book, nor read a single letter from it.
And for this reason, this method is lacking in our local medical science. And I have never found it to be entirely good, and I have not obtained that which I have obtained only because of the length of reading the ancient books and the study beyond understanding them until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Then I adhered to experience and the study through the length of my life.
And now I have described to you from that in this Chapter all that my science contains: and for what my experience has passed over, after I abbreviated it for you and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and showed it at the end of declination: and I formed many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, as there is addition of declination, just as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
Head II.
We must say in the prologue of this Chapter that summaries of speech and heads, for whose understanding the craftsman is compelled to take up his position regarding their truth: namely, that you, and those who are proficient, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
I say therefore that when a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or accident befall someone, then it is necessary first to hasten to let blood from him and release him, either by one method or both simultaneously: if nothing prevent such, as a lack of strength: or he who befalls something from those is a boy or an elderly decrepit man: or it is a time of intense heat or intense cold very much.
Then let him be content with his food, vegetables that are cold, and fowl and hares. And prohibit wine, and fatty meats, and being filled from foods and every food that fills the veins with blood. When you are secure from the hot apoplexy and fear no outflow of matter into the limb, then the sick person should return to his usual regimen with which custom led him first.
When therefore the broken jaw begins to heal, then the sick person should be fed with nourishing foods in large, ample, and substantial quantities, in which there is richness: such as dishes made from cooked wheat with water, rice, heads, feet, and bellies of cattle, eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar substances. With this regimen, the fracture coagulates more quickly and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in the first stages of old age and decrepit, cannot always be maintained and strengthened according to their natural condition because of the drying out of their limbs: and those which are maintained and remain strong at the end of their strength, like the bones of young boys, do so.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.
And know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the members: for a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the skull bone; and a fracture of the rib bone is different from a fracture of the spine bone: and similarly, all other members differ from one another. And I have come with the recollection of every species of fracture exposed in my Chapter, each distinguished from the other. And the species of bone fractures are also diverse among themselves.
For there is a curved fracture, besides splinters that may occur in it. And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and there are fractures called satagiae, i.e., splinters, and additions proceeding from them, as in a reed when it is fitted with a knife for writing. And not proceeding from it: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the head: and there is a small fissure fracture.
And there is an appropriate art or instrument for each species in its restoration, as will be recalled in its respective places.
And from that which is known of a bone fracture, there is its tortuosity and elevation: and its appearance to the sense, and the sound when you compress it with your hand.
When therefore there is no tortuosity apparent, nor sound at the touch when you feel the bone with agitation, and the patient does not find great pain: then there is not a fracture there, rather it is possible that there is tortuosity, or a small fissure: hence it is not necessary to move it with your hand and compression entirely, rather place it on top of what comes from medicines, which will be recalled after the momentum that suits the place: then the stricture is tightened gently.
And know that when the place is bowed and split into two, besides what happens in it of separation, yet every part is removed from comparison with its proper state: then you must begin at the hour when such an injury occurs to correct it, equalizing it before a hot suppuration arises.
If therefore hot suppuration arises, then let it be left for a few days until the hot suppuration subsides. Then equalize it according to any method possible from gentleness and ingenuity.
And know that the restoration and equalization of such a place is easier than the bone where separation occurs.
Then tighten it according to what comes to your memory of the method.
If indeed there are separations in the bone, then extension of this fractured member from two parts is necessary, if it be a hand or foot: or with your hand, if the member is small: or with two strings, or with a string and your hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb upon an equal place according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the fractured member are extended: then try to make those additions return with all your ingenuity and in any manner whatsoever in their places: and beware according to your strength, lest by your operation pain come to the weak, nor injury: and try according to your strength that you apply one or both bones with their associate, according to better forms.
And you must at that hour try and feel it with your hand. And if therefore you see something different there, correct it and equalize it with the measure of your strength.
And beware of excessive extension and strong compression, as many fools do. For many times they cause hot abscesses or contraction in the limb to occur through their operation, as we have already seen from their operations many times.
Then apply after equalization and a suitable operation, and the binding of that limb, and rest, and tranquility: and advise the patient to be upon it. And make him beware, lest he move it in the hours of his waking and his sleep at the turn of his body and its agitation, and during his defecation and all his movements with his last strength. And let him beware that the position of the limb does not cause pain. For when he feels pain or injury in the arrangement of the limb's position, then you must change it to another arrangement where he does not feel pain.
And beware with it, so that its position be that which is equal and straight: lest there be a tortuosity in the member when it is restored.
And the quality of the compression of the fractured member is as I narrate.
Know that fractured members vary in their littleness and size, and in their form.
Therefore, for those that are small, such as the arm, the finger, and the thumb, and similar parts, it should be a卷绕 of a soft, fine cloth. Those that are large, such as the thigh and the leg, should have a broad, hard卷绕 of cloth.
Since a broad ligament connects the large member and tightens it equally from all sides, so that it does not enter the member through any spot.
Then begin after your evacuation from the equation by applying the appropriate ointment to it, on soft cloth over the place of the fracture. Then begin to卷绕 the ligament over the place of the fracture in three or four turns, according to what is deserved by the member: and slightly tighten your hand with the ligament.
Then proceed with it to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and tighten it less than you tightened the fractured place. Then extend yourself with the卷绕 from the place of the fracture slightly, and gradually soften the compression until you reach a large amount from the healthy area.
Then take another cloth and wrap it again over the fractured area with folds. Then go with the wrap to the lower part from the fracture. And let your operation be in the tightening of the wrap and its softening, according to what we said in the first upper wrap.
Then place between the wraps of soft cloth or cloth that matches the curvature of the fracture, if there is any curvature; and if not, do not place anything there.
Then wrap another cloth over the same one. Then apply astral stones centered over these wraps immediately, if there is no inflation and no hot abscess.
If, however, there is inflammation or an abscess, then place over it what sits and removes the inflammation, and let it remain for a few days. Then tighten the astral stones over it then.
And let the astral stones be made from the middle sections of broad, scraped, and skillfully shaped sticks. Or they may be made from wood that is cut to form sieves, which are made from pine or palm branches, or from flax. And let the width of every astral stone be according to this form and this same shape.
However, the astral stone placed over the treatment area should be slightly thicker and broader. The length of the astral stone should be appropriate to the size and perfection of the limb.
Then stitch over theAstellas with another thread, according to the first incision. Then ligate from above with threads appropriately, according to what we said about incision; and let your incision be more over the place of the fracture, and the less it is elongated from the fracture, the greater the incision.
And let the threads be medium in thickness and fineness, and let them be made of soft linen.
For if the threads are thick, as I saw in the operation of those placing coarse threads from twisted linen fibers, it is a great mistake: for the incision falls outside the proper quality.
And fine threads again do not suit: for you will not achieve through the incision what you wish.
And it should not be less than an inch between the Astella and the next Astella.
For if the patient is injured at the extremities of the Astella after the incision in healthy tissue, then place something soft such as fine wool or matted wool underneath until nothing is injured from it.
When there is a fracture with a wound, and there is a rupture in the skin, I will treat it with the remedy mentioned in the chapter according to its particularity.
And know that not every fractured limb should be stitched with Astellas from the first day. For when a limb is large, you should not place Astellas over it from the first day, but only after five days, or seven days, or more, according to your safety concerning the risk of a warm abscess.
And this is the measure of plasters which the ancients used, which are applied over fracture and dislocation.
¶ The Measure of the Abbreviated Common Plaster, which restores fractures and is suitable for many complexions, especially women and children: for it is prepared from what neither heat nor cold overcomes.
And take from the flour dust of the mill, which is the meal that hangs on the walls of the mill near the motion of the grinding stone: mix it as it is, except that sieve it with bran mixed in: and place its preparation neither thick nor thin. Then use it.
¶ The Measure of Another Plaster, which restores fractures, dislocations, and twists. Recipe almond, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugat: and take the juice of all, amounting to ʒ X myrrh, and ʒ V of aloes (both types), and ʒ XX alethil. Pound all together, sieve them, and mix with alethil water: or with bran mixed in if the patient's complexion is heated. Then use this plaster. For it is of good composition, and restores fractured bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ The Measure of Another Plaster, which also benefits fractures and twists. Recipe mugat, myrrh, almond, and white alethil, amounting to ʒ X of myrrh, ʒ V of each type of aloes, and ʒ VI of acacia, and ʒ XX of Armenian bile. Pound all together with much pounding, sieve them, and mix with water or bran mixed in: and administer them.
The method of applying a plaster to joints and bones separated from their places: and it soothes the pain that occurs in them, and the fracture of bones, and the incision of bones. Lana succida is taken, and submerged in boiled oil and vinegar, and applied to the place.
And indeed, this plaster has no restorative virtue, but it is good for soothing a hot apostema: and it expels pain properly.
The method of applying a plaster that restores a fractured bone. Take the leaves of fig and the leaves of broom sapling: and rub them all together, and make a plaster from both.
The method of applying a shortened plaster for the restoration of a fractured bone: and when you wish to promote the resolution of remaining apostema. Recipe for the root of althea, chamomile, violet flowers, and herb flour, each one part: all are rubbed together, and mixed with wine if the limb is not already heated.
If it is already heated, then mix it with coriander decoction or with water, and use it.
The method of another stronger plaster for the resolution of an apostema that occurs during the restoration of a limb. Recipe for the root of althea, linseed, balsam flower, melilot, sarsaparilla, violet flowers, and chamomile, each one part: all are rubbed together, and mixed with willow water, or sweet water, or wine. That altogether according to the heat of the member and the quiet of its warmth.
Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a broken member during its restoration, unless it is made from charcoal and oil; nothing else: and he described what lies between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno, however, it has been seen that things are placed on a broken member during its restoration, in which there is the extraction of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense, and similar things as we have described.
¶ The Mode of Plaster that Contributes to Injuries and Pain. Recipe of mugwort, chickpeas, human hair, eagle feathers, and salt in equal parts: grind them, sift them, and mix them: and make thereof a plaster.
The quantity, however, according to which one should remain the bandage, and then dissolve it, is such that you consider whether if no pain, itching, or displacement of the fractured jaw from its place does not occur in the ill person: then do not dissolve it over many days. If, however, itching severe, or disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the place: then hasten, and dissolve it at that very hour, and remove the plaster from it. And take a soft cloth, or a gentle marine sponge, moistened: and immerse it in warm water, and apply it to the place until the itching subsides, and the pain is relieved.
If, however, itching severe, or disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the place: then hasten, and dissolve it at that very hour, and remove the plaster from it. And take a soft cloth, or a gentle marine sponge, moistened: and immerse it in warm water, and apply it to the place until the itching subsides, and the pain is relieved. Then let the member rest for one hour. Then place above it a soaked lambskin in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and ligature it over it for one night until you are secure from the hot abscess, and inflammation of the member subsides and the pain is removed.
Then repeat this until the constriction becomes fine and subtle, and the poultice is prepared: but do not apply the constriction strongly or finely at first, until it is cured.
If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, inflammation, and all other symptoms are entirely removed, and you need a poultice and constriction, then repeat this as you did at first equally.
If nothing from what we have said happens to the member, then do not release it until after three days, or four, or five, or seven. And when it is released after twenty days, as appears to you from the healing of the member, as we have said, until when a fracture adheres and coagulation of flesh approaches over it: then add to the constriction more than your first constriction entirely. And add also in the thickening of food for the weak, according to the preceding recollection of it.
If you see the place of the fracture drying up and thinning out more than it should: then know that nutrition is prevented from reaching it. Embathe it with warm water at every place where you release it, and let it be for all three days, and ease the constriction a little.
By this operation, nutrition flows to the member and it is quickly cured.
That which the stupid restorers do in the case of a broken member when it is not restored at first according to what ought to be done, and is restored according to tortuosity, is an error from their operation and great fear: and if it had been right, they would have said that which the ancients said in their books and would have operated with it.
And I have never seen any trace of them in that entirely, and it is better that that not be done.
¶ On the treatment of accidents in the head.
The species of fractures are diverse, and its figures are many: and the causes of it are distinct.
For it is a fracture that results from a blow with a sword: and the blow removes all the flesh until it reaches the periosteum, which is beneath the bone, just as an axe splits wood: and for this reason, this species of fracture is called axia.
Or the sword strikes a bone and cuts its surface without penetrating to its full depth: and this species of fracture is called kalaan, that is, simple fracture.
And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
And it is a fracture that results from grinding or abrasion: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar incidents.
And this fracture is also penetrating, which now approaches the panniculus, which is beneath the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and it is a wound of these two fractures, either large or small.
And from fracture is that which is hidden in bone in subtlety of hair: and it is a small fissure, and for this reason it is named this kind of fracture Capillaris.
And from these is the fracture which occurs from accident or impact of a stone and similar ones which cause the lamina of bone to enter the interior, and it results in concavity: as happens with workers of copper when they are struck and a part of them enters the interior.
And this happens most often in the heads of moist bones, as are the heads of children.
And these fractures of each of these kinds are separately treated, and I will deal with them in the place where they are mentioned.
And we recognize all these kinds of fractures by examining them, and investigating them with probes, and removing decayed flesh that is over them.
The species Capillaris is recognized by this, that it is detected over the bone, and is cleaned and covered with wax: for the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of fracture, first consider the condition of the patient: then if you see from the symptoms one that signifies clearly through fear, such as vomiting of cholera, extension, loss of intellect, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, and egress of eyes, and their redness, and similar symptoms in many dispositions, beyond a doubt he is not cured: and if you see symptoms that do not frighten you, and you hope for his health: then begin his treatment.
What is more, if he comes to you wounded first when he is wounded: and this is during the winter days, then it is necessary that you study the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
And if it is in days of summer, then you must hasten to remove the mouth before the seventh day, lest what is under the bone from the flatus corrupt, and those accidents which we have narrated occur.
And if the fracture of the bone has reached the flatus touching the brain, and is with small parts and suction: then you must incise the broken and powdered part according to what I tell you.
And you must scrape the head of the wound and探测一下，这段文本是否需要调整或翻译有误，请告知。
And if you encounter the flow of blood or hot abscess during the examination of the bone, then apply to it what we have to. And you must fill the area with wet cloths in wine and rose oil: and make the wound rest until the abscess is settled, and be free from the flow of blood. Then begin with the curing of the bone, and its removal.
And this is done according to one of the two methods.
One method is to incise the bone with an Incisor of sharp steel: and this is its form.
Then administer an Incisor of another kind, slightly broader than the Incisor: and this is its form.
Then administer also an Incisor of another kind, even broader than the second.
And the second method is to have a number of Incisors of different kinds at your disposal: some shall be broader than others, and some shall be sharper than others. Their extremities should be finely sharpened, made of steel or iron. Use them with care in striking over the Incisor, so as not to shake the head and damage it.
If the os is hard and strong: then it is necessary to perforate around its edge before you administer Incisoria with Terebrae which are called non profounding Terebrae: and they are not so named unless because itself does not pass beyond the limit of bone flesh to that which is after it: for the Terebra is a round extremity over that which is under its head acute, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents submerging and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is fitting for you to take a number of these Terebrae much, each of which shall suit the thickness of the bone, until there be a Terebra for every skull: whose acute extremity in length and shortness shall be according to the thickness of that skull.
And this is the form of three species of Terebrae, or Trepanae.
The quality of perforating around the fractured bone is: you shall place the Terebra over the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone is now penetrated. Then exchange the Terebra to another location, and place one that has the thickness of the radius or about that size.
Then incise with the Incisoria between the hole from the bone: and make it finer than you can above that from the end of levity, as we said, until you eradicate the bone, either by hand or with some other instrument you have prepared for it: such as tenaculi and thin tongs.
And it is necessary to be careful with every caution, so that the Terebra or Incisoria does not touch anything from the siphac.
When therefore you encircle the mouth to perforate it, and it has been separated from the sinus, if it be continuous with it, and you have extracted it, you must scrape, and level the end that remains in the bone with another similar instrument Incisor. It must be thin and more delicate with the other Incisoriis.
If anything remains from the small bones, and you seek them out: then take them with facility, using what you have among your instruments. Then care for the wound after that with ligatures and ointments as we have said.
And another method of operation is easy, far removed from fear: which Galen said and praised highly: and this is his word. It is necessary for you first to begin by uncovering the portion of the bone in the place where the fracture is more severe and more visible: until you have uncovered that part and placed under it the extremity of this lenticular Incisor, of which this is the form.
And the lenticular part is soft and does not strike anything: and its acute part goes into both sides of it lengthwise, as you see: so that the lenticular part is attached to the sinus, its acute end striking the bone.
Then strike above the Incisor with a small mallet from one side until you cut through the entire bone with facility, as it revolves: and be secure with a cloth to prevent anything undesirable from happening that you fear entirely.
And if the physician were not a more foolish man and less knowledgeable about it, nor sleeping, then if anything attached to the bone remained in some places from the cloth, he would cut it off with the extremity of that lenticular Incisor, and release it from the bone with facility. For it is released from him without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the panniculum, and that which is cut off from the bone is its face, and roughness and fine cracks remain in it: then you must scrape that roughness, and remove those fine cracks with very sharp razors which you have prepared in different quantities, so that it may be possible for you to administer therefrom in every place more suitable and more correct according to what the operation leads you to, and the bone fractured and its shape. And you must administer according to your judgment, whereby you first scrape the bone more widely with those razors. Then use the finer one afterwards.
And you must administer according to your judgment, whereby you first scrape the bone more widely with those razors. Then use the finer one afterwards. And you must not cease to do this with continuity until you reach administering it more finely and more subtly.
In each of the remaining small and fine fractures, you must attend to it with care, according to what leads to its correction.
And it is a matter that is not hidden from anyone who has any study in this art, and it stands above what we have written and shown in major fractures.
If the panniculum is retained when you remove the bone: then you must take a linen pad, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. Then take another linen pad, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first pad: and make it as easy for you as possible to place it so that it does not burden the sponge.
Then administer the broad ligament above it: and do not tighten it, unless by the amount that holds the wound only: and let it be removed with this care on one day, or two days, until you are secure from the hot abscess. Then remove it, and administer after it medicines with which there is excessive dryness: such as the roots of lily, and powder of herbs, and incense dust, and aristolochia, and similar to these: and make of these medicines a powder, which is to be sprinkled on the wound as they are dry.
And universally administer to it all medicine of the property of which it is to cleanse and not corrode. And take care according to your ability, that the wound be clear in your cure: neither let there be filth of ointment nor foulness in it.
And take care according to your ability, that the wound be clear in your cure: neither let there be filth of ointment nor foulness in it. Nor let the poison aggregate in it at all: for when poison aggregates on a cerebrum pad, it corrupts and putrefies it, and great evils happen to the sick after that: and this has already happened in a scrotal abscess, when the orifice is cleansed from it, especially when the care of it is neglected, blackening occurring on its surface.
Therefore consider then, if the sick person experiences the accidents we have said, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
And if blackening does not occur, except from the medicine placed upon it, and is in the nature of that medicine, so as to cause that blackening: then you must take one part by weight from honey, three parts from rose oil, and lines with them a pad. Then place it over the abscess: afterwards care for it with the kinds of treatment which are appropriate until it is healed.
¶ On the Restoration of the Nose When Broken.
Know that the nose is broken only by the upper two parts together or by one of them; for they are two bones. The lower part is cartilaginous and does not break, and it happens to it only through friction and distortion and similar conditions.
If one of the two parts is broken, then you must introduce a little finger into the nostril and reduce the fracture with your index finger and the thumb on the outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. This should be done with ease. And beware that no pain ensues from your operation upon the sick person.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger does not reach it, then you must reduce it with the extremity of the radius, where there is a small prominence.
If the fracture is in both parts, then make something similar to it and hurry with its restoration on the day of the fracture if possible. And if not, then on the seventh or tenth day after the abscess has subsided in quiet.
Then introduce into the nostril a ligature from linen cloth if the fracture is in one part; or introduce two ligatures if the fracture is in both parts: and let the thickness of the ligature be such that it fills the nostril.
And some of the ancient restorers said that licorice should be infused in butter, and be exchanged every day. That, however, does not appear to me advisable; rather, it should be infused in licorice decoction and mixed with flour milled from the mill. Then remove the licorice until the bone firms up, and the cartilage hardens.
And at times a swan's feather soaked in licorice is inserted into the nose over a soft cloth: and it comes about that the nose holds the fracture more strongly, and so the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this is not a necessary thing. If you wish, do that; and if you wish, use licorice.
If a boil occurs in the nose while operating, plaster the nose with cerate, or with ointment infused in rose oil, or a moderate amount of dyacantha.
If, however, a hot boil does not occur, then it should be plastered with a mixture of sesame flour and powder of incense mixed with butter. Then place a soft plug over it, and do not bind the nose at all.
If, however, the bones of the nose are fractured or broken into pieces, then it should be split over them, and extract them with the instruments that are suitable for this. Then suture the incision, and care for it with ointments or plasters that are suitable for this.
If a wound occurs in the nose, then you must treat it with ligatures, and administer a cannula of lead until it is healed.
On the Restoration of the Lower Jaw When It Is Broken.
When the lower jaw is broken, and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then see if it is a fracture outward only, and not broken into two parts, and is directed toward the inside: then its location is easy to determine.
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you must insert your left index finger into the mouth of the patient: similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert your right index finger: and gently push the deformity of the fracture inward with one hand from the inside of the bone part, and at the same time equally move it outward with your other hand.
If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts, then you must apply extension from both sides, according to straightness: until it is possible to equalize it.
If, however, there has already been a loosening or breakage of the teeth, then tie those from which you hope some will remain with a thread of gold, silver, or silk. Then place over the broken jaw a ceratum. Then place over it a doubled cloth, and place over the cloth a large wick properly shaped: or a fragment of sole skin equal in length to the jaw.
Then ligate it from above, according to how the ligature is prepared for you and suits its application, until it does not break down: and command the patient to remain in tranquility and rest, and place a light liquid diet for him.
If thouest, however, that somewhat is altered in the figure in some manner: then hasten, and dissolve it on the third day. Then rectify what is altered from that, and plaster it with mill dust, mixed with oil of alum or with sesame flour, after you have removed the corrupted part: and place soft wool over the plaster.
While therefore the attached plaster remains on it, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, release it, do not dissolve it, until it heals: or bind the fracture. For this fracture is bound three times in seven days.
If hot abscesses should occur meanwhile, then administer what we have said many times for the relief of such abscesses until that abscess is removed.
And if there is a fracture with a wound, consider. For if a fragment of bone is now separated, or from the site: then take care in this, that you remove those fragments from the saggia along with what suits you for their removal from the instruments.
If the wound opening is constricted, then dilate it with a lancet according to the amount needed.
Then when you have removed the saggia, and nothing remains thereof, then if the wound opening is large, stretch it. If not, place upon it from plasters which suit that, and cause it to flesh over until it heals.
¶ On the Restoration of the Furcula, When Broken.
Surely the furcula is fractured from the anterior part of the humerus side, and its fracture occurs according to one of three modes.
For it is fractured and separated into two parts, besides which accidents may occur in the attempt to restore it. And this is easier to repair.
Or thus, as accidents may occur in the bone itself: and this is harder to repair.
Or it is a fracture accompanied by a wound.
And the operation in such a case, when the fracture is without a wound, is to have two attendants present: one holds the assistant's aid which follows the fractured furcula, and the other extends the neck toward the part.
Then equalize the fracture with your fingers until it takes the proper form: and there should be neither prominence nor concavity in it.
If you need more extension, then you must place a ball of cloth or wool under the furcula of the patient, and its size should be according to the necessity. Extend and elevate the furcula, and compress the ball with your hand until you equalize the fracture as required.
If you cannot draw the extremity of the furcula to the exterior because it has reached the depth, then you must have the patient lie on his back with his neck supporting his head. Place a medium-sized pad under his shoulder, and let an attendant press on the other shoulder downward until the jaw of the furcula, which is in the depths, is lifted upward. Then correct the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.
If thou perceivest sathaiatum from the furcula and it moves: then thou must find over it, and draw forth that sathaiatum with facility.
If it is retained in the bone, then apply skill in incising it with one Incisor you have prepared for that purpose, after thou hast placed under the furcula the instrument which saves sifach: and this instrument is made of wood, or iron. And this is its form.
It is assimilated to the cochlearis that has no concavity.
And let its width be according to that for which thou dost need it from the size of the bone and its thickness. And let its length be according to what is possible for thee in performing the operation.
And let it have two ends, as thou seest: and one end be broad, and the other sharp.
If the disruption of the wound which thou dividedst when thou drewest forth the sathaiatum from the bone is wide, and thou art wary of a hot aposteme: then join the two sides of the wound with suturing.
And if the disruption is small, or thou fearest a hot aposteme: then fill the wound with cloths and wools according to the size of the incision in the wound.
And if a hot aposteme happens, then steep a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it over it.
And if the stricture of the bone is without wound and without incision, then thou must place over the bone a plaster made from mill flour with alum. And place a soft plug upon it. Then place a sphere under its lamp, if you need that. Then take the hemamata, that is, the long wheel which the Saracens use, and let its width be that of one palm, or about that. Then place a doubled pad over the plug and plaster. Then take a strip from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and let its length be similar. Then wrap it in cloth. Then wrap the cloth with the strip in place of the hemamata which falls over the fracture and its place. Then place the hemamata over the fracture as it is rolled, and wrap it around its neck, and under its healthy lamp, and under its weak lamp: and bring it over every part, and make sure that the stricture holds the fracture in a proper stricture: and this is that which is not hidden from you, and entirely, so that the strip does not come off over the mouth of the fracture. And for this reason, you should examine the weak one every day. Whenever therefore the ligament softens, and you see the strip has come off, then straighten it out and tighten the ligament.
Then place the patient's pillow on its back, and put a small pad under its lamp near its pillow at night, so that the assistant may be raised from its side. Therefore, a fracture of the furcula is elevated through the elevation of the humerus.
Bind the arm to the neck of the same person: and do not release the ligament unless it happens due to itching or from an aposteme, up to twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see that the face is reddening due to it. And add to the stricture, and release it until it is restored and coagulated.
And the fracture of the furcula is strengthened and reinforced for the most part within twenty-eight days: and sometimes it occurs in some people in a shorter time.
¶ On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Spatula.
The spatula fractures rarely, and only in the broad part of its location: and its edges are the parts that are not fractured.
Therefore, when the broad part fractures and it breaks in the middle, and is not recognizable except by touch, then prepare its fracture according to its form. And reduce it in accordance with its natural form as much as your skill allows.
Then place over the area powder from the mill mixed with white wine, and gentle plaster, and place above it a poultice of doubled cloth. Then place over it a broad splint from a thin board according to the size of the entire spatula, or slightly larger.
If, however, there are concavities in any of the places where the spatulas are, then equalize that concavity with soft pledgets until the spatula descends according to equality.
Then pinch above with a long aluminum forceps, of a suitable constriction and firmness of the spatula, until it is not removed from its place.
And consider the ligament every day. Whenever the ligament is softened, tighten it, and equalize the spatula if it is removed from its place: and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And the spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
When this number is completed, then release the ligament: and you will be in safety. For it is from the bones whose union is not feared, nor their dissolution.
If it proceeds from a bone fragment and pierces beneath the skin, then cut above it, and remove it. And do what we said in the treatment of a thigh abscess from the sublation of heat, if anything occurs from it.
¶ On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Rib Cage.
The chest sometimes fractures in its middle, and this occurs rarely. Its ends, however, fracture and break most often due to its conditions.
When its middle is fractured, which inclines to the lower parts, and a severe pain, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing happen to him: and perhaps he vomits blood, and the concavity of the broken bone becomes evident, and is not hidden from the sense, Restoration of his condition is, that the sick person be laid face downward on his own back: and place a cloth between the spatulas.
Then press his shoulders, and approximate the ribs from both sides with your hands: and refine in adjusting him, according to every possible manner in which it suits, until the figure of the bone returns, as it should.
Then place a plaster and a poultice on top, and place above it a splint from a thin wooden board, or cherry wood, and from those similar in lightness, after you wrap it in cloth. Then refine in binding it over the broken bone, so that it does not move: and go with the bandage according to the roundness to the back several times, and tighten it with an appropriate tension.
Then consider the bandage at every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it: and if necessity prompts its removal due to itching, or corrosion that occurs in the area, or pain, or suppuration: then hurry, and remove it, and eradicate the plaster, and correct whatever happens with the method of its cure.
Then reduce the plaster if you see it affecting the face: and apply a bandage to it until it heals.
¶ Restoration of Ribs when Fractured.
You should know that fracture of the costae (ribs) does not occur except in broad places which follow the spine, and at their extremities from the anterior part. And abrasion does not occur to them except for the reason that they are cartilaginous. And the perception of it is not hidden from the sense during inquiry with fingers.
And its restoration is done thus: equalize the fracture with the fingers according to the possible manner until the figure is equalized, as required. Then apply a plaster, and bind the fractured opening with a splint if it needs that.
And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined toward the interior: then it happens that there is a severe pain and puncture, like that puncture which occurs to one who has pleurisy: for the bone pierces the membrane, and also to him there happens difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is difficult to cure.
And the ancients have devised many ingenious methods for this: and among them are those who say that you should give foods to the patient that cause inflammation and wind, so that the stomach may become inflamed, expand, and push the fracture outward.
We, however, shun it so that there is not a cause for the rapid formation of a hot abscess if it does not occur. If it has already occurred, then add to it.
And some of them have said: apply wind to the place, then draw it out with great force, and this is more in accordance with reasoning. Indeed, it is feared that the suction will draw excess humors to that place, owing to the disposition of weakness.
And some of them said: It is necessary to cover the place with wool that has already been submerged in hot oil, and place the wicks between the ribs until it is filled: so that the ligature be equal when you enclose it according to the roundness.
Then the patient should be treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
If the patient is greatly constrained by the illness, which he cannot endure, and the mouth of the wound is irritated by a membrane puncture, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary to cut open at that place, and expose the fractured rib. Then place over it the instrument that conserves life, the use of which has been previously mentioned: and incise the wound with facility, and incise it.
Then suture the two wound lips together if it is large: and treat it with ointments until it heals.
If a hot abscess occurs meanwhile, then act quickly, and pour the wicks in rose oil over the place, and place them on it. And treat the patient accordingly for the abscess.
It is also turned over to the opposite side while the patient sleeps until it heals.
¶ Restoration of fractures of the vertebrae of the spine and neck.
Fractures of the bones of the neck sometimes occur, and wear is rare in them: similarly, fractures also happen to the vertebrae of the spine. When therefore it happens to someone, and you wish to know whether he will be cured or not, then believe. For if you see his hands already softened, numb, and dead: and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them: and when you contract them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not sense pain in them: then know that he will not be cured, and in many such conditions it is fatal.
If he can move them and feels the contraction in his hands with your fingers and the prick: then know that the bone of his wrist is sound, and that the sick person will be cured.
If it happens similarly to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether he will be cured or not: then consider his feet. If you see that they are softened, and this occurs in them as it does in his hands: and when he lies on his back, wind and vomiting occur without volition; and when he is turned onto his stomach, vomiting occurs without volition; and when he is turned onto his back and wishes to defecate, but cannot: then know that it is fatal. Therefore, do not labor in his cure.
If however nothing like this happens to him, it is a milder condition.
And the cure for what happens to him is that you attempt to induce the subsidence of the hot abscess: thus, you shall apply only rubbed rose oil over the vertebra: or with matured calves' dung.
Apply it to the affected area several times a day until the hot abscess subsides. Then apply one of the ointments that are strengthening, drying, and contracting over the place, and tie it with a bandage. Command the sick person to use rest and tranquility. Let him not sleep on the part where he finds pain until it is healed.
If it happens during the friction of the sesamoid bone or something that has already separated from it: then you must incise the skin and remove it. Then draw together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitches. Then treat the wound itself with some flesh-forming ointment until it is healed.
If indeed the last rib is fractured and the end of the tail is reached: then you must introduce the thumb of the left hand into the anus and equalize the fractured bone as much as possible with the other hand, and make a second adjustment.
Then place something over it, and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment that preceded it until it is healed.
¶ Restoration of the Anus.
Head XI.
Rarely are the bones of the anus fractured. If they are fractured, then the fracture is not a break but a fragmentation at the ends of them: and they split lengthwise and incline toward the interior: and there is pain and a puncture in the area, and the limb that is fractured becomes paralyzed.
And the restoration is to extend your hand over it until you stand above the fracture to determine its shape.
If the fracture is only at the ends, then equalize that fracture according to the adjustment you make, until it resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture is in length, or already inclined towards the inward parts: then make the sick person lie on his abdomen until preparation is made for the restoration of that fracture. When you have equalized it, apply a plaster over it: then place a splint of wood, or bark, over it: and bind the bandage tightly enough that you fear no displacement of the fracture, nor removal of the splint.
And equalize the concavity of theirs with that which shall fill it, until the bandage takes it according to equality: and command the sick person to sleep on his back, or on his healthy side.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs in it: then cease from extending it and its restoration until the hot abscess is seated: then place over it what seats it, as has preceded, and then return to its restoration: and bind it as necessary.
If, however, the bone is fractured or broken, extract it.
On the Restoration of the Fracture of the Humerus.
The Adiutorium is that which is between the elbow and the head of the Spatula.
If therefore it is fractured, then its restoration is according to one of the two methods.
One of which is: take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to the following form.
And bind two ligaments at both ends.
Then let it be suspended from a raised place: and let the patient sit on a seat. Then project his broken arm on to the wood until it reaches the knot of its wood, in the middle of which is attached a ligature.
Then suspend something heavy from above, so that it stretches the patient to the lower parts. Then the physician should align the fracture with his hands simultaneously until the fracture returns to its proper position, as is necessary.
And another method is that the patient be turned supine on his neck, and suspend his hand from his own neck with a ligature. Then command two attendants, one of whom should hold what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other should hold below it and stretch each of them to their respective parts.
And if you wish for the extension to be stronger, then tie below the fracture with one ligature, and above it with another ligature: and each of the two attendants should stretch them to their respective parts.
If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it must be placed one ligature below the knot, and another below the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it must be placed a ligature above that place, and above the elbow.
Then align the fracture with ease without effort until the fracture is properly aligned and a good reduction is applied: then tie it, if no warm abscess occurs.
If indeed a hot abscess occurs, then remove the bandage until the seventh day. And place upon it wet wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the abscess subsides: then bind it up; and the proper binding is to place a plaster over the fracture.
Then place an wrapping of new cloth over the plaster. Then bind the arm with the auxiliary bandage, and place your hand open on your shoulder.
And place a cloth, and bind it over the auxiliary arm bandage, so that the arm stands in place of stakes: if nothing prevents you from doing so, and nothing is altered on you from the broken bone.
If you fear that something will be altered on you from the broken bone, then use stakes: and you should place over the fracture a stake which is wider and stronger than the other stakes. And place the width of each stake to match that of a finger: and the length of the stakes should be according to the fracture with an additional three fingers on every side.
Then bind the stakes with the bandage I said at the beginning of this chapter.
And the bandage should be tighter over the site of the fracture. And the more the fracture extends, the less tight the bandage should be.
If therefore you observe the placement of the stakes and the bandage as we have said, then do so. And if you fear a hot abscess, then remove the bandage and the stakes until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then consider the ligament for three days in all, so that no itching, or swelling occurs in the place, or food be prohibited from reaching the member because of the disposition of excess stricture. Therefore rectify that entirely, according to what we have said.
If truly nothing happens beyond your expectation, then do not untie the ligament until after three days, or more.
And let the patient lie on his back, and his hand on his stomach: and place under the supporting cushion a full pillow equally stuffed with wool.
And consider at every hour of the night or day, so that the figure of the fractured member is not untied, or the ligament is not softened. Therefore rectify that entirely with your skill.
And provide the patient with food according to the order we have prescribed, so that it be fine food at first, until his appetite begins to diminish: then it is necessary to increase his food.
For it is customary for the helper and thigh to be tightened for forty days: therefore it is necessary to untie them, and to administer a bath, and to treat with ointments that rectify that.
If the fracture is foul and rubbed, then do not untie the ligaments and splints for fifty days, and until two months.
¶ Concerning the Restoration of a Fracture of the Humerus.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the humerus and the femur.
One of them is small: and it is that which follows the thumb. And the other is large, and it is that which is placed below the small one at the lower part.
Perhaps therefore only the larger bone is broken, or the smaller one: perhaps they are broken together.
When therefore the bone of the thumb is broken at the upper part, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the bone is broken at the lower part, its fracture is severe, and its healing is difficult.
And it is worse when both bones are broken together.
If therefore the bone that is broken is the small bone at the upper part, then for the physician in its restoration, it is fitting to apply a gentle and easy extension until it is set.
If however the broken bone is the large one: then it is necessary to apply a stronger and firm binding.
And it is necessary to apply the shape of the hand in its restoration, and its extended position on a cloth. And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the other fingers: and let the lower joint be below all the other joints, or the rest: and let the sick person sit square on themselves, and let the cloth be before it, or directly in front of it, at an appropriate height, so that the sick person does not incur labor.
Then extend the limb from the inferior part, either by hand or with a ligament. And another assistant extend from above similarly.
Then the physician equalize the jaw until it returns to the best possible position.
If there are fragments in the fracture, then strive to reduce each fragment to its proper place by your strength.
If it appears that there is a detached fragment, and it pierces the skin, and you have no hope of its restoration: then cut over it, and remove it in the manner we said in the preceding matters.
If the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter on that, so take the treatment from there.
If a warm abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then apply a cloth soaked in cerote made from rose oil, white cerote, and let it be medium in thickness: and tightly bandage it with a thin string until the abscess is settled: then remove the cerote, and apply a plaster prepared from miller's meal mixed with albumen of egg. Then place splints, and let the splint placed over the fracture be somewhat wider and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most arrangements: whether the fracture is in one humerus or in two humeri simultaneously.
Then place your bandage over the fracture site stronger and more intense, and somewhat tighter towards the upper part of the fracture or towards its lower part: or place a milder bandage slightly looser, according to the previous reminder at the beginning of this chapter.
And let there be cloths that are wrapped over fractures, soft and moist cloths: and let them not be hard or rough. And let there be a thread that is tied from linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have described.
And consider the limb and ligament after days. And if anything occurs that requires correction, such as itching which happens in the limb: then it must be that you foment the limb with warm water until that itching ceases, and let the limb not be constricted until it ceases, then repeat the stricture.
And if the stricture has already softened, and the opening is already distant, and similar conditions prevail: then correct that entirely by your power, and consider again.
For if nutrition is prevented from reaching the limb due to the excess of stricture, then it must be that you soften it somewhat, and release it for a few days until the nutrition reaches it, then you should tighten it again.
If, however, nothing不利的情况发生于患者，那么除非在二十天之后，或者大约这个时间段之后，否则不应使其松弛。
Then suspend the hand of the patient beside his neck. And let his neck be of equal length, and be protected by its own strength fromagitatory movements. And make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days, and perhaps it is restored in eighty days. This is according to the dispositions of complexions, and the dispositions of virtues.
¶ On the Restoration of Broken Hands.
Know that the combing of hands and knotting of fingers rarely results in fracture. And it does not occur to him unless there is frequent friction.
When therefore the fracture of the foot or friction occurs: then the patient should sit with his legs crossed, and the seat opposite should be arranged according to equality. Then place his hand on it with it extended.
Then have the attendant extend the broken bones, and adjust them until they are properly joined.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, unless warm suppuration occurs. Then place the splint above according to the size of the area: and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
If the fracture is lower, near the abdomen of the foot, then make a similar sphere from linen cloth: and direct the patient to hold it against his fractured foot: then bind it with a long strip of linen.
And let the splint be made of leather, soft enough to apply the leather to the foot: and bind it appropriately.
If the fracture is on the outer side, then it is necessary to place a splint above, and another from below on the foot: and let the hand be open and straight. Then place the tension, as if the hand were rotated: and extend between the fingers with a ligament.
And if a fracture occurs to any of the finger nodes, then if it is the thumb, it is adjusted according to what is required. Then it is to be strained with the sole: and if it is fractured, place for it a straight, small stake: so that the fracture may be elevated, and not moved.
And if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, or little and ring fingers, then it is adjusted and bound to the healthy finger that follows it: or all may be bound according to their sequence: and this is better. Or place a small stake above it, as we said for the thumb.
And consider in your restoration, and after the aforementioned arrangement, apply a warm poultice: and oppose it with what is required, when something occurs from it, according to the further narration of its treatment.
¶ On the restoration of a hip fracture.
The bone of the hip is fractured many times, and the fracture is made known by sensation: for it turns toward the inner and posterior parts.
And its restoration is done thus: a ligament is placed above the fracture, and another below the fracture. And the patient is laid on his face.
Then the assistant extends all the ligaments to their respective parts according to equality: and this is done when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
If, however, there is a fracture near the root of the hip, then ligament should be tied to the pectineus part, so that extension goes upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
And thus similarly if there is a fracture near the knee, then the ligament near the knee should be tied, so that extension goes downwards.
Then the physician should equalize the bone with his hands until it reduces according to the likeness of the natural figure: and the bone should be joined with good union.
Then you should apply a plaster and a bandage, if no abscess occurs in the limb. If an abscess does occur: then let it be allowed to drain for a few days until the hot abscess settles, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be applied in such a manner. It should be wrapped over the fracture with a firm bandage, that is, a binding: and doubled it twice or three times, and let the excess remain. Then wrap the thigh until it reaches the heel at the root of the toes.
And insert a long thread between the hip and the thigh near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts. Then wrap the excess around the thigh and hip with additional bandage.
Then place splints over the hip at the site of the fracture, and place one splint over the knee socket.
Then fill the spaces between the thigh and the knee with soft cloths, so that the compression is even.
Then begin with strong compression from the middle above the fracture site in three windings, or four. And the more you lengthen with the bandage from the place of the fracture, the less and softer your compression should be.
Then attend to the two extremities of the thread, which you inserted between the thigh and the leg. Therefore, bind with three turns of the thread above each extremity. Then proceed with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts until you reach the ankle. And tighten also the ends of the threads from the other side: so that the ligament is not removed from its place.
Then release the compression above that area while it remains, so that no corrosion, abscess, or similar conditions occur to the member. If anything happens from that. Therefore, act promptly with the remedy, and correct what has happened from that entirely, as we have said many times.
If there is a fragment of bone that causes pain: then you must equalize it if it is possible for you to do so. And if not, cut over it and remove it: and attend to that which was mentioned previously until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is drawn together, besides which staples are added, as we said in regard to the hip and arm.
Verily in the restoration of such a fracture, the weak do not suffer from limpness. And if it is restored alone, besides which the other thigh must be applied to it, then that for whose use it is must always limp.
And know that the thigh is drawn together for fifty days, or a little more, or a little less. All of this depends on the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
¶ Concerning the restoration of the fracture of the knee cap.
Know that the fracture of the knee cap is rare, but it is often subjected to wear and tear.
If, however, a fracture does occur, then it is neither more than a crack nor a hole in its parts. And it may be with the wound or without the wound. And it stands over that entire area with sensation.
And its restoration is such that it is equated with what is disrupted from its parts, until they are aggregated and joined as much as possible according to the equality and ease, and construction.
Then apply a plaster of sesame flour or wheat flour with cow's milk albumen. Place a round staple over it if you need that. Draw the area together with a bandage suitable for this.
Then consider all the dispositions which we have narrated concerning other fractures: just as hot abscess and similar conditions: so that you may oppose every accident with what agrees with it until it is cured.
¶ On the Restoration of a Fractured Femur.
Know that the thigh has two bones, one of which is large and is called by the name of crus, and the other is fine and is called fibula.
And fractures occur in both of these bones just as they do in the two bones of the arm: and for this reason, their restoration is conducted similarly to the restoration of the arm, and the treatment is one and the same.
And if both bones are fractured simultaneously, the thigh turns in all directions.
And if the finer bone is fractured, the thigh turns toward the anterior part.
And if the larger bone is fractured, you will find it below: and these are things that are not hidden from you.
Then administer extension, equality, and ligature of the tendons equally.
However, if the fracture of the thigh is a foul fracture, having many sethagi [knots or nodes], then the extension should be lesser, and the application should be milder.
And in the thigh there is something from the operation that exceeds the arm: and it is this, when you equalize the tendons and complete your entire operation, then take two bands made of pine wood, which are used in making sandals and placed under the boards: they are made from the shoulders of the palm: and choose those that have a small thickness, neither being too thin: and let their length be according to the length of the thigh from the knee downward.
Then wrap each cloth with two folds according to its length. And place one part of the leg from one side, and the other part from the other side: and let them extend from the knee to the lower part of the foot.
Then tie two bands in three places from both ends and the middle. For when the constriction is prevented, the leg bends to the right and left, and remains in a good position.
And now let a splint of wood be applied according to the length of the leg, and place the leg in it, so that it may be preserved from movement.
And it is particularly necessary to do this when there is a fracture with a wound properly.
Then examine the leg every day, and attend to it with the utmost care from suppuration, or swelling, or other ailments. If therefore anything occurs from these, then apply to it what is necessary until it is cured, if God wills it.
On the Fracture of the Bones of the Foot and Toes.
The heel, however, does not suffer a complete fracture.
Fractures of the bones of the foot do occur, and even fractures of the toes occur to a lesser extent: and such occurrences are due to friction in various positions.
If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs, and you see those bones elevate towards each other, then the sick person should place his foot on a prepared surface as if walking.
Then stand thou, and place thy foot upon that which is raised from those bones: afterwards press, or trample it, and level it until it returns to its places.
Then place the plaster and suppure it above: and place beneath the belly of the foot a small board, which has two flat heads.
Then bind it with the foot using an appropriate ligature, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things it needs.
When therefore three or four days have passed, then release the ligature. For thou wilt find the bones leveled, whether they be broken or dislocated. The operation therefore is as you see.
If some of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and level them as I have told you in the restoration of the hand. Then place with your finger a splint according to the length of the finger, and let it be somewhat wider: then place beneath the foot this board which I have told you about, and bind it with an appropriate ligature.
If however what is broken from the bone is two, or three, or more, then place over each finger a splint of its size, wrapped in linen cloth: and bind the board beneath the foot: and let there stand above one head of the board outside the belly of the foot, to hold it in good retention.
And thou shalt take it upon thee not to forget, whenever considering all that I have told thee in the rest of the fractures from the accidents we have discussed, to compare every accident with what is required.
On the fracture of a woman's vulva, and of the ribs and spine of a man.
When the vulva of a woman is fractured, then make her sit in a square position. Then incline her towards the side of her back slightly, and let it be held behind.
Then the midwife should fill the vulva with cotton until it is full: and let the vulva be thus filled with cotton like a sphere.
Then shake the woman, and elevate her back gradually. For the cotton comes out until it is before the opening of the vulva like a sphere, and the fractured part returns.
Then place a pillow on her back. When therefore she wishes to void, remove the cotton with facility, then void: and reduce it again according to the manner in which you introduced it at first, then return to her original pillow.
Let her do this for seven days or about that time, for the fracture will heal in seven days.
And if you wish, take a catheter of reed, and insert it over the opening, and fully introduce the catheter into her vulva. Then blow into the catheter with force until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, for the fracture will return.
Then fill it with cotton, and let her remain for a few days, as we have described, until she is healed.
And when the cheekbone of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and its equalization that which we have narrated concerning the bone of the jaw.
And the rectum is not concealed in these nearby fractures, which touch only slightly, especially for someone who has some study or use of it.
And understand my book well, for the fracture itself signifies to you in many dispositions the right way in its restoration and correction: understand therefore.
And when the bone of the cheek of a man is broken, take the quill of the goose and introduce it there. Then place over it an inversion of cloth, and let it be covered, and be left for three days, or about that time. And it will be cured if God wills it.
¶ Concerning the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
It is fitting for one who has suffered a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if it is great, such as the hip bone, or auxiliary bones, that you bleed him immediately: if they certify to you the conditions of bleeding, as we have previously stated.
And if the wound flows with blood, then you must hasten to its excision, so that you powder over it the pounded chalk as I have said: if you do not have another present.
Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not delay that, if no abscess occurs.
If indeed a hot abscess occurs, then allow its cure until the ninth day, until the abscess is settled. And do not approach it on the third day and entirely on the fourth, for you would cause it to happen evil accidents.
If the broken bone is projecting above the skin: then you must reduce it, and equalize it with your hands with ease and slight stretching.
If, however, extension and equalization with your hands are not prepared: then reduce it with this instrument. And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the size of seven or eight fingers: and its width is according to the size of the wound. And for that reason, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them according to the size he needs for that from the cure of every kind of fracture.
And let it be round: and let its thickness be small, so that it does not double upon itself under compression during the operation: and let its ends be acute, with edges at its extremities. And let the upper part of it be thick to half its size, and the lower part thin.
And this is its form.
In This Operation, place its acute end curved over the projecting end of the bone: and push it with one stroke until the bone returns and is brought to some degree of alignment.
Therefore, try to equalize the ends of the fracture brought together.
If the extremities are fractured and fine, and does not receive it with a good grasp of the instrument, then it must be that you cut the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
If indeed you cannot reduce them entirely with what we have narrated, then cut it off using the instruments of incision which we have described: or cut the limb with any one of the saws as is possible for you.
Then scrape that which remains in the bone from its roughness and fine splinters.
When therefore the bone is reduced, and the patient finds after reduction a severe pain hurting him, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Do therefore that. For you provide great aid to the patient when you complete the restoration you make for the bone.
Then soak the cloth in the styptic wine, which is black. And properly if it is in summer. And do not place anything oily over the wound, nor anything else: so as to prevent putrefaction and corruption from occurring.
Then administer astral stones at the time of your completion of the restoration of the bone. And remove the exposed wound: do so by cutting with forceps a hole in the tissues according to the size of the wound.
And be careful with every precaution, so as not to tighten the wound with the fracture. For many times have these stupid physicians done this: and it has happened to their patients either death, or corruption, or zuchem, that is, putrefaction. And let your stricture be soft, gentle, different from the fractures of the rest.
And if the wound is bad, or a large wound, and you fear some evil accidents which we have narrated, and find pain hanging in the place: then it is not proper to put astellas upon it. And make involutions with pieces of hard cloth in the place of the astellas, and bind it tightly with them.
And when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove the cloth upon which you placed it with wine. Then administer licinia and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds: such as tetrapharmacos ointment, and similar ones.
And it behooves you to loosen the ligament. And examine the wound in the morning and evening every day until it is consolidated and healed.
And it must be prepared so that the limb may drain from it pus downward with ease.
And if many days pass over the wound, and it does not consolidate, nor is the pus discharged from it: then know that there are small bone fractures in that place. And therefore you should examine the wound by probing it. Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa. And quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post viginti dies, aut triginta.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae. Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri. And perhaps it prohibits the member from its natural operation.
Consider therefore if the knot is recent: administer to it medicines that have a styptic quality, such as aloes, and incense, and myrrh, and storax, and acacia, and similar substances.
Thus, take from these some or all of them, and mix them with styptic wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and apply them over the knot on a cloth, and bind them well around it.
And release the binding, but do not loosen it for many days. Then release it, and repeat with another until the knot is removed.
Or bind over the same sheet of lead evenly. For lead has the property of removing whatever is feared from the members.
If the knot has already been converted into stone and is hardened, and urgent necessity demands its removal: then pierce it from above and cut away the excess: or shave it with some razors until it is removed: and take care of it until it heals.
For the care when restoration occurs, and the member remains subtle, not according to its natural state.
When a bone fracture is restored and the member remains subtle and weak, then it is not so only for many reasons. One reason is the multitude of solution of the ligaments and their binding not according to what is necessary: or due to excess binding of the ligaments, until nutrition is prevented from flowing to the member: or due to an excess application of ointment at an inappropriate time: or due to a deficiency of blood in the weak and weakened body.
And the treatment of that is to nourish the sick, and to make the body tender until the blood increases therein. And administer a bath. And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Then place pitch over the limb: that the pitch may be drawn to this abundant nourishment. And apply the embrocation with warm water until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
¶ Concerning the cure of fractured bones when they are restored in a twisted manner.
When after the member has been restored following its cure, there occurs a twist and prominence of the fractured bone, or nodulation, and the form of the member is spoiled by this: yet the member does not prevent its natural operation: then it is not necessary to receive the opinion of him who thinks that the member should be broken again.
And there have already been many dull or unskilled physicians and restorers who have done this in our land.
And this operation is indeed highly blamable, leading to death or a great fear, so as to be mortal.
But if the limpness and nodulation are recent: then it is necessary to apply an embrocation with warm water in which soothing herbs have been decocted, such as the leaves of althea, its root, and melilot, and similar things. And let him be applied an ointment with a softening plaster, such as dyachilon made somewhat diluted.
A mucilage of the root of althea may be taken and mixed with chicken fat or sesame oil, and applied as a plaster.
Figs may be taken and beaten with pigeon dung, and similar substances named from medical sources that diminish consolidation.
And sometimes the knot is dissolved with frequent, old, and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands. And movement of the member to all parts at all hours should be administered.
If, however, tortuosity has already occurred and become strong, and is transformed into a stone, and the necessity for treatment with iron arises, then it must be cut above it, and the continuity of the bone must be separated, and what is excessive from the knot or bone with fine surgical instruments must be removed. And facilitation must be given to it with diligence and zeal.
On the Speech Regarding Dislocation.
Dislocation is the exiting of some joint from its place. Therefore, it is prevented by its movement, and the figure of the member is distorted. And it causes severe pain and serious injuries to the weak.
Therefore, when dislocation occurs in someone, it is necessary to hasten to restore it; one must not delay this entirely.
For if it is delayed, the area becomes infected, and perhaps along with it, the reduction of the dislocation.
Therefore, for that reason, it ought not to be moved, nor extended during the hour of its apostema. Because it often causes spasms and painful ailments.
Verily, when this occurs, then it is necessary to hasten to bloodletting of the patient. Then it should be released until the apostema subsides.
Then the limb is soaked with warm water and oil. Then it should be reduced with facility.
And the entire limb should be treated as well as any part whose location is remembered.
I have indeed arranged the chapters on dislocation, even according to how it preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower part thereof.
¶ Concerning the care of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two lower jaws are rarely dislocated.
And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two modes. For indeed they are displaced from their places by a slight removal and are slightly relaxed. Or they are dislocated completely, fully, until they relax towards the chest, until the saliva of the patient flows out and it cannot hold that position, nor can it close its mouth, and its tongue is covered with speech.
When the displacement is small, then it returns into many positions by itself with a few efforts.
If the dislocation is complete and total, then it must be reduced quickly, and no delay must be permitted: and the minister should hold the head of the patient. And the physician should insert one of his fingers at the root of the mandible of the dislocation between his mouth, if the dislocation is from one side. Or insert two of his fingers simultaneously, if the dislocation is from both sides. And the rest of his fingers be outside, with which he will equalize.
And command the patient to clean his mandibles and release them for eating to all parts. And the physician equalizes the mandible and pushes it until it returns to its place.
If the reduction is difficult, especially if both mandibles are involved: then apply vaporization with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy. Do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
When therefore they return and are equalized, and the mouth of the patient is closed, and does not soften: then place wadding poultices over them, with cerote made from wax, and rose oil.
Then bind it with ease using soft ligaments.
And let the patient sleep on his back: and his head be held between two poultices, so that it does not move to the right or left: nor may he attempt or be forced to chew anything: rather, let his food be easily drinkable until the pain is removed and the mandible is healed: then he may eat what he wishes, and it should be administered with ease.
Let him not labor over the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and speaking, until the jaw is ligated and healed.
If the reduction of the two jaws should become difficult when dislocated at any hour, and they do not return to their places: then often fevers and frequent soreness occur, and perhaps the belly of the patient is relaxed, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
When therefore you see that, then know that it is a loss, and often he who suffers from that dies within ten days.
On the Reduction of Dislocation of the Clavicle and the Extremity of the Humerus.
The clavicle is not dislocated from the inner side, because of its continuity with the chest. And it is dislocated sometimes to the outer side, and this can be perceived by sensation.
And the restoration of it is to lie down sick on his back and extend his arms. Then reduce it to place with your palm applying strong reduction, for it will return.
Then place an ointment and pellets over it, and bind it tightly.
The extremities following, such as the elbow, which are continuous with it, are not dislocated, except rarely. If it is dislocated on some day, then it must be reduced and adjusted according to what we have said, and as you have prepared it.
Then place over it a plaster, and pellets, and a ligature. And command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is cured.
And when this same cure is applied, the extremity of the Humerus is reduced when it is separated from its place.
¶ On the Reduction of Dislocation of the Humerus.
Know that the Humerus is not dislocated except according to three modes.
One of which is that it may be dislocated towards the radial side towards the lower part. The second is that it may be dislocated towards the chest side. And perhaps it may be dislocated towards the upper part of the Humerus: and this happens rarely.
And it is not dislocated towards the back, because of the blade of the bone. And it is not dislocated towards the front, because of the nerves.
And indeed, the Humerus is most often dislocated and comes out towards the lower part, towards the radial side: especially in those cases where there are few muscles. For it comes out quickly in these cases and returns quickly.
In those cases where there are many muscles, the opposite is true: namely, it comes out with difficulty and returns with difficulty.
And perchance it happens to some men a blow or accident, and the Humeral bone becomes inflamed with a hot inflammation, and is supposed on account of this, that it has already been dislocated.
Therefore, you must experience this until you stand certain of it, and then proceed in his cure.
And dislocation is known when it is inclined towards the lower part: and distinguish between the dislocated Humeral bone and the healthy one. For you will find a clear difference among them, and you will find a concavity in the head of the Humeral bone, and beneath the titillate near the touch of the head of the bone as though it were an egg: and the sick person cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it by all motions.
And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you will find that the touch is obvious and not hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent, or the patient is an infirm boy.
And its reduction is to elevate the patient's hand to above. Then place your thumbs beneath the titillate of the patient, and elevate the joint with strength upwards to its place: and the assistant should elevate his hand and extend it upwards. Then place it below, for it will return quickly.
If, however, it does not return through what we said, and many days have passed from the beginning when the dislocation occurred, then the sick person should bathe in warm water, and a relaxing and soothing fomentation should be administered, as if the roots of althea, fenugreek, and melilot were decocted in water and given.
Then the patient is turned supine on his back: and under the prominence of his body a sphere of wool and linen, which be equal in softness and firmness, is placed.
Then the physician places his heel on the sphere, and elevates the head and shoulder with force, and draws the patient's hand toward the inferior.
And if you wish, reduce him according to this manner: and it is such that you make a man present who is longer than the patient, and stand from the side, and insert your shoulder under the prominence of the patient: and elevate his prominence to the superior position, until the patient is suspended in the air. And another attendant draws the patient's hand toward the inferior part of his abdomen. If the patient is light, then something else must be suspended with him, to加重他：因为脱位会立即恢复。
And the patient is reduced according to another manner: and it is such that a long piece of wood is fixed in the ground, whose head is round, like the handle of a mortar: it should neither be thick nor thin. Then the patient is placed under him, after a soft cloth is placed over his head. The patient should stand according to the length of the wood.
Then extend his hand downward from the other side, and extend his body from the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place quickly.
If its reduction through all that we have said shall be difficult, then use this care: and it is, that you take a stick whose length shall be the quantity of two brachia, and its width the quantity of four digits, and its thickness the quantity of two digits: to which let there be a round head, so as to facilitate the entrance into its depth according to this form.
Then bind over the round head with soft cloth, so as not to injure the weak wood.
Then place it under the pillow of the patient, so as to extend the hand or arm over the stick until the lower part: and bind the stick over the aid and arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then place the arm on the step of the ladder across its width, and extend the hand downward, and let the remaining body hang from the other side. For the joint enters immediately.
When therefore the entrance of it is completed according to whatever mode is possible, then you must place under the stick a sphere of equal quantity made of wool. Then place the prepared plaster made from milldust with incense and white egg albumen over the whole shoulder, as it is rolled on top.
Then bind the reduction under the stick with a suitable bandage: and roll the ligament over the plaster from above: and attach his hand to his neck, and let it not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary to place a light diet for the patient until the limb is strengthened: for it is quicker to heal him this way.
Then it is placed again after seven days, or five, and exercised with motion. If therefore it firms up and does not soften, then it is now healed.
If the joint dislocates many times, due to moisture that occurs or for some other reason: then it is necessary to apply a cauterization with three holes, as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
If all this is done and the ligament is dissolved after seven days and the joint is not reinforced and the plaster and bandage are reapplied several times and do not firm up, and it falls and cannot be raised to higher positions: then know that the nerves near the head of the humerus have been cut or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never set in its place.
Dislocation that occurs towards the breast and nipple, or to the rear, is reduced with a push and extension using the hands: until it returns to place, and further bandaging and care should be applied until it is healed.
If after healing there is heaviness in the limb and a delay in its movement, then the patient should use bathing frequently until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original nature.
On the Treatment of Elbow Dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and similarly reduces with difficulty. Indeed, it dislocates in all directions, and especially towards the front or the back.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it is visible and tangible, according to whichever form it may be dislocated. And when you join a dislocated elbow to a healthy one, it is clearly shown to you. For the joint is concave, and it cannot bend the arm, nor touch its own shoulder.
And you must act quickly and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs.
For if a hot abscess occurs in it, the reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it is not cured at all, especially when it is situated behind. For it is worse than all other species of dislocation, and causes a more severe pain: and often death descends with it.
And the restoration of it, when it is one of those that can be reduced, is as follows: extend his hand with both hands; let his arm be spread out, and the doctor's hands be above the elbow and below it, and he himself should press the joint with the thumbs of his own hands simultaneously, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Or the dislocation is to the front: then it is reduced by bending the hand with his own hand until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the root of his palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a strong and powerful extension: and it should be as follows: two attendants extend the arm; and the attendants hold it firmly so that it is not moved during the extension.
Then let the arm be turned to every part, after which a doubled long cloth or a broad ligament is wrapped over his hand.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with oil; that it may be lubricated by those things that assist in smooth movement. Then apply a strong impulse to the joint until it returns.
And after reduction, it should be placed over the joint a poultice with styptic and drying properties with white oil, and secured with a suitable bandage. And suspend the arm from the patient's neck: and release after a few days.
Then let it be dissolved. If the joint then becomes stable in its place, then release the ligament from it, and let it be.
And if you see that the joint is not well secured, then apply the poultice and ligament again, and release it after a few days until it is secured. Then release it.
If, however, heaviness occurs to him after the reduction of the joint and the disposition is in motion, then administer a moistening in bath treatment, and a fine friction, and compression until it heals, or place over the joint a ligature, that is, fatty tail of a sheep. Then ligate it, and let it be over it day and night. Then remove it, and immerse it in the bath. When therefore he sweats, then rub the joint with a tempered rubbing. Then apply it to the same part once more, and twice, and three times with the bath water, until it is alleviated.
And if you wish, place over the same thing guano, moist and heated with butter, and bind it tightly.
Do this several times. It is then alleviated, and returns to its normal condition.
¶ On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Shoulder.
Almahassem's hand is dislocated many times, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
And the reduction of his dislocation is easy. In contrast, for other joints. Indeed, it must be that the speed of reducing his dislocation is done within the hour when it occurs, before the site becomes inflamed: or a hot abscess may occur.
And the reduction of his dislocation is as follows: place Mahassem's weak hand on a table, and have a minister extend his hand. The physician should then place his palm over the prominence of the joint and push it until it returns to its proper position.
Indeed, it must be considered that if the palm has already receded towards the forearm: then the patient should place the back of his hand on the table during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is progressing towards the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be internal on the table, i.e., the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table, so that the physician's hand falls over the prominence of the joint.
If therefore it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then apply it with a soothing poultice and let the former thing go, nor repeat that.
For if it does not tolerate, and you cannot effect a reduction in it after the days have passed, yet the joining will remain according to its tortuosity: and nothing hurts the weak, except that the hand is softened, and cannot apply pressure: then know that the nerves are cut or rubbed.
Therefore, there is no need for ingenuity in it, except to apply the cautery closely at the site of the injury. And perhaps it will not yield anything.
When therefore Almahassem does not return, then apply over it the poultice that we have described. Then apply pressure and let it be for five days: afterwards loosen and let it be, and exercise the hand.
If however it is deprived of its motion, and something of heaviness occurs in it, then apply warmth to it with hot water and friction several times until it is relieved.
¶ Concerning the cure of dislocations of the fingers.
When the finger is dislocated in any direction, or to the back of the palm, or to the front of it: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger, and hang it in the direction towards which it was dislocated, and let it be for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straight on that very day.
When therefore the night comes, ligate it according to the narrative itself: and do not cease to release it on that day: and exercise it with motion: and ligate it at night.
Do this for some days until it tightens.
And similarly do this with it if it is dislocated to the abdomen by hand: and ligate it to the same part, and do your first operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do this with it when it is dislocated to other parts.
¶ Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the vertebral column.
When the vertebral column of someone is dislocated completely, or many vertebrae are removed from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death hastens upon the sick person.
And the sign of this is that the sick person voids without volition and cannot retain it: and often certain members of his body, or both his legs, or both his arms, or one of them, are softened from it: or a vertebra is removed from its place.
For it is often removed, and this removal happens four times.
That which is removed to the rear is called Gibbositas.
The treatment of this is such that you should consider it then: if Gibbositas occurs in childhood, there is no cure for it, and there will be no complete healing from it.
In those cases which occur by chance, or blow, or similar ones, the ancients have already spoken of the methods of cure in a lengthy discourse. He who goes out with profit does not return with the same.
I have indeed abbreviated from that which, although little excused, I derived from his proximity and my intention. And by my exposition of it, and by forming an instrument thereof in a different manner from that in which they showed and explained it.
I say that in a hernia which occurs from the anterior part, there is no inguinal hernia, nor cure from it.
And similarly in that which occurs on both sides as well.
And it is not cured from them, except for that which occurs on the back properly, as I narrate. And it should be done by extending the sick person face down on a level board close to the wall: and moist straw should be placed under him to prevent his chest from being injured.
Then a straight stick is placed fixed in the ground at the end of the board near its head: and another stick is placed near its feet at the other end of the board. The attendant holds the stick and stands not firmly fixed in the ground. And another attendant holds the other stick.
Then wrap it around the head of the sick person, and tie a soft yet firm ligament under his chin. Extend the end of the ligament to the stick that is near his head, and tie it there.
Then tie another ligament over his hips and his knees, and near his ankles. Then aggregate all the ligaments and tie them on another stick that is by his feet.
Then let every attendant stretch the ligament to the part of the stick, and do not remove the two sticks from the places where they are fixed: yet let them not be tightened as we have said.
And the physician shall place his palms on the spine with force until it returns to its proper position, or he shall place a board over it. Then he shall place his feet on the board until it returns.
If it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arm breadths. And prepare a place in the wall near the patient where the end of the board can enter. Then place the middle of the board on the spine. And the physician shall place his feet on the other end of the board. And tighten it well until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
Then, if you wish, use the drill that is wrapped with your hand: and place two sticks of one arm's length at the head of the patient near the last pillar. And place two sticks of one arm's length at his head near the last pillar.
And let the length between all the sticks be one hand's breadth. Now a hole has been made at every place through which the drill passes. And let all the sticks be firmly fixed in the ground so that they do not move at all.
And a round piece of wood is introduced: and it is a wheel on which a ligament is revolved in two holes of two pieces of wood.
And at its extremity is a hole, in which the piece of wood is fixed, whose length is a palm with what revolves: and similarly on two other pieces of wood.
Then tighten the ligaments which you have tightened in the chest of the sick person on the wheel which is at his head: and the ligaments which you have tightened in his legs on the wheel which is at his feet.
Then stand by each wheel a servant who shall turn his hand with the wrench with which the wheel is revolved: and the physician adjusts the Spondyle, according to what we have said.
This is the form of the wheel, which follows.
Then, after the Spondyle returns and the place is adjusted, you should apply a drying plaster with albumin of wine. Then apply the plaster. Then place above the plaster a splint from a board, whose width is three fingers or about that. And its length shall be as much as will accommodate the degree of gibbosity, and over the healthy part of the Spondyle.
Then bind it with the ligament as we have said. And let the sick person use subtle nutrition until he is cured.
And if something of prominence remains in the place at the end of the cure, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe, together with the use of the board which we have described for a long time. And now the lead plate is administered in that.
And sometimes prominence occurs at the last vertebra of the spine: and it is suspected to be a dislocation, and that is the gap which now protrudes. Wherefore it should not be assumed that this medicine will work for him; for perhaps it will cause his death.
¶ Concerning the Treatment of Dislocated Shoulder.
Know that the joints of the shoulder and the humerus only occur when there is dislocation: neither do they suffer what other joints suffer from a slight removal and concavity.
And the shoulder joint is dislocated according to four parts. That is because it can be dislocated forward and backward.
And it is most frequently dislocated inward: and only slightly dislocated forward and backward.
And the treatment of its dislocation inward is as follows: when you join the lame leg to the healthy one, it is longer, and the knee is more prominent than that of the healthy side, and the lame person cannot double their leg at the groin. And the place that follows is prone to a boil from a hot boil because the head of the femur has already reached there.
And the sign of dislocation outward is that it has symptoms contrary to these symptoms.
And the sign of dislocation forward is that it extends the healthy leg to its full length; however, it cannot double it without pain in the knee: and if it attempts to walk, it cannot go beyond that point forward: and his urine is retained, and his groin becomes inflamed, and during walking there is a pressure on its heel.
And the sign of him who has suffered dislocation to the rear is that he does not extend the knee, nor can he double it before doubling the groin: and his leg is also shorter on the other side: and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is at the place of loins.
The reduction of this species of dislocation is such that you may consider it then, if the dislocation is old, which has already been long-standing in possession. Then if you administer the reduction of this, and it remains according to its proper position: then there is no further cure needed. Therefore, it is not necessary that the presumption be made entirely against him.
In him, however, whose dislocation is recent and is of one of the four species of dislocation: then hasten to this, that you may reduce it, and extend it both inward and outward, and move it with the right and left hands: perhaps it will return and will not require any other cure.
If, however, it does not return in this way, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend his leg from the lower part: either with your hands or with a ligament tied above his leg above the knee: and another assistant extend his hand from above, so that he may insert his hand under the patella. Then bind it with a gentle ligament at the root of the femur, and hold the end of the other ligament.
And the extension of his leg should be either from the anterior part of the groin to the forked bone, or from the posterior part to the spinal column.
And let the extension of them all proceed in one manner until the sick person is lifted with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
And this form of extension is a common form among the four forms.
If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every form that I say about proper cure.
In the reduction of such cases when the dislocation is internal, it is necessary to place the sick person on his healthy side. Then place the ligament over the root of the femur, at the part that is between the head of the femur and the groin. Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the upper part of the body, to the shoulder blade.
Then let another strong assistant take hold of its arms, and reduce the swollen part of the diseased thigh, and extend it outward with vigorous extension. For it has now returned to its place.
And this form is easier than the other forms of cure, in which this limb is reduced.
If however it resists you, and does not yield to you in entering with this form of cure at all: then it is necessary to tie both legs of the sick person together with a strong but gentle ligament over both heels and over both knees: and let the length of each be four fingers from its proper size: and let the diseased thigh be extended more by two fingers.
Then let the sick person be suspended over the head of the wood, which is in the house: and let the length thereof from the ground be the quantity of two brachia.
Then command a strong youth to support the thigh bone: and let him be suspended with the sick person. And the youth supporting the thigh shall push with strength, for the joint returns to its place with velocity.
In the case of its own reduction, when there is a dislocation outward, let the sick person lie on a platform, as we have described for one with kyphosis. And let the ligament be tied over his thigh, the sick one properly, and over his chest.
Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head. Then let a piece of additional wood be placed in the middle of the platform, well fixed: upon which wet cloths shall be wrapped, so as not to injure the sick person: and let the wood be between his thighs, so as not to be drawn towards the lower parts during extension.
Then let every attendant extend to his part, and the physician equalize the reduction with his hand.
If therefore it obeys in returning, it will be good.
And if not, place something on the table and press it evenly, as we have said for kyphosis. Nevertheless, let the sick person lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is anterior, then let the thigh of the sick person be extended quickly: and this is according to the same description on the platform: and the physician shall place the掌心 of his right hand on the groin of the sick person. Then he constricts it with the other hand, and with that constriction places it extended to the lower part of the knee.
And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the patient be extended to the lower part and raised above the ground. On the contrary, he should be placed on a hard surface, as is also necessary if his shoulder is dislocated outward, according to what we said about his lying on two shoulders: and he lies on his face with the ligaments stretched, as we said recently.
And it is necessary to apply compression with a board even to the area where the joint comes out, when reduction is completed according to what is required.
And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend both legs of the patient. And when you see them equal, and the patient contracts his leg and extends it without excuse, then know that the limb has now returned to its proper place according to what is required. Then join the two thighs, and apply a plaster, and bind with an imema, that is, a ring. Thus, so that the shoulder does not move in any direction, and let the patient remain quiet for three days or four.
Then release the ligament and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in position, then know that the dislocation is now firm: therefore discharge the patient to walk.
And if you see any softening: then return, and plaster that area, and bind it according to your first binding. Leave it bound for three days.
Then loosen it and make it delay in walking on both sides for several days until it is well strengthened.
¶ Of Dislocation of the Knee.
The knee dislocates according to three modes. It dislocates to the outer side, to the inner side, and to the lower side, that is, to the back.
And it does not dislocate to the front.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply his leg to his thigh. If it does not adhere to the thigh bone, then you know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is to make the patient sit upright, so that he extends his leg if possible over it and his back presses against your face: and place his foot between yours.
Then make his knee adhere with your palms, and place them straight between your fingers over his knee. Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with force. And another assistant extend his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of the restoration is that the leg adheres to the thigh gently, not laboriously.
Then dress it, and make the leg adhere to the thigh. Then ligate it together with the vein for three days, or four. Then release it.
And let the patient not use walking for several days until he is cured.
If, however, reduction is not successful for you, then administer a strong extension with ligaments, of which the preceding narration has been given in the cure of the spine, until it returns to place.
¶ On the Cure of Dislocation of the Calcaneus.
The calcaneus is sometimes dislocated by a slight displacement, and sometimes dislocated completely. And its dislocation occurs either towards the inside or towards the outside.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you will see the calcaneus swollen, protruding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
The cure of its displacement is easily reduced: and it should be extended with ease by the hands, and brought into alignment until it returns to place.
In the cure of its dislocation when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright: and a strong attendant should hold him firmly from behind at the midpoint of his back.
Then hold the foot from the upper part with your right hand, and from the lower part of the foot near the heel with your left hand.
Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand. Then with the left two fingers.
Then extend with the left hand, and push the foot's chest in the direction of the right leg without effort.
Do this twice, as we have described.
Then push the foot's chest toward the leg in the third movement, and you draw the tendon.
If therefore it returns in the first or second movement according to this manner, and you see the foot level, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it: for it will return.
If however the reduction is forbidden to you because of what we have described: then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a stake firmly into the earth so that it falls between his thighs: and you now wrap a cloth around him to prevent the patient from being injured.
Then the attendant should take the patient's thigh: afterwards, the attendant should extend the other foot, either with his hands or with a ligature which he ties around the ankle of the foot. Then every attendant should extend against the comparison of his own extension: and the stake should stand between the two thighs of the patient holding him, so that his body is not drawn downwards during the extension.
Then the physician levels the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh downwards. For the dislocation returns with great speed.
When therefore the dislocation returns and you perceive the signs of its return: then apply a plaster and a styptic, and bind it firmly with ligatures, and tie the foot to the thigh with a ligature.
And you must beware or fear of the nerves that are behind the heel, so that there be not a strong ligament above them and it injure them.
Then let him rest for two days, or three. And if the ligament be softened, tighten it: then release it on the third or fourth day, and prohibit the weak from walking for forty days. And if he endeavors to walk before that time, security is not achieved, for dislocation occurs above him, and it is damaged, and does not receive subsequent cure.
And if a hot abscess occurs: then you must administer for its soothing that which our narration precedes elsewhere in the cure and application until it is removed.
¶ Dislocation of the Foot Fingers and Treatment.
It must be adjusted what dislocates from it with only slight extension without labor: and this is neither difficult nor is it easy.
And if the dislocation is in certain nodes of the foot's dorsum: then let the patient sit with his foot on an equal place of the ground or on a board: and he should stand as though walking.
Then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from those joints. Then press on it with your foot with force until it returns to its place and you see that it is now adjusted, and no protrusion appears in that location.
Then place under the foot of the patient a board which shall hold the entire foot, having two ends. Then bind it tightly with a bandage for three days. Then release it, and let him rest from walking for many days until it is bound and securely fixed by reduction.
¶ Concerning the species of dislocation with wound or fracture.
When something occurs of this kind, and you attempt to cure it and its restoration, death often follows. For this reason, one should not presume over the cure of such cases, except those who are prudent in their art, long accustomed to its use, merciful, pious, slow, neither rash nor presumptuous: and let him use only the medicines at the beginning that cool inflammatory swellings: and let him dismiss the sick according to divine judgment. Unless you do not perceive or hope for salvation from destruction with the gentleness of illness, and in which there appears something of hope. Therefore, attempt the reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before hot inflammation occurs.
If therefore the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that cools the inflammation: and care for the wound with what is appropriate for it from drying ointments.
If the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture, and there is separation at the joint, then attempt to remove them, and do for it what we said about simple illnesses from what preceded in those places.
