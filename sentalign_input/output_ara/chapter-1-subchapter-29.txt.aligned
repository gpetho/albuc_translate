On Cauterizing Warts.	On cauterization for pleurisy.	0.6840282
The ancients mentioned cauterizing cold warts with birthwort roots in this manner: Take one of the longest dry roots of long birthwort that you can find, about the thickness of a finger. Then dip it in oil and set it on fire. Then cauterize once between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and twice lightly below the jugular veins, inclined towards the area below the chin, and twice deeply above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.	The Ancients mentioned a cauterization for cold pleurisy by means of the roots of the long birthwort, in this fashion: you take the longest you can find of the roots of the long dry birthwort, and of the thickness of one finger; dip this in oil and light it at the fire; then burn the patient with one cauterization in the space between the junction of the neck with the clavicle; and two small cauterizations below the jugular veins, inclining slightly toward the region below the beard.	0.8606273
And also cauterize twice between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclined slightly towards the back, and once in the middle of the chest, and once above the stomach, and three times on the back: once between the shoulder blades and twice on the sides of the back below the cauterization that is between the shoulders.	And two big cauterizations above the nipples in the space between the third and fourth ribs; and two more between the fifth and sixth ribs, tending slightly toward the back; and another in the middle of the chest; and another above the stomach; and three more behind, namely, one between the scapulae and two on either side of the dorsal spine below the one between the scapulae.	0.8445054
And you should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be on the surface of the skin, a superficial burn. Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery, similar to a probe, and they heated it and inserted it between the ribs until it reached the wart itself.	It is not necessary to cauterize deeply, but let it be a mere hint, in the outer skin. Now one of the Ancients mentioned that there were some people who used an iron cautery shaped like a probe, and introduced it red hot into the intercostal space until it reached the abscess itself and evacuated the pus, as we have mentioned under tumour of the liver.	0.7541939
And the pus comes out as we mentioned in the case of liver tumors. This reckless cauterization is very dangerous; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops in the area that cannot be healed.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is a danger either that the patient may die on the spot or that an incurable fistula may arise at the place.	0.7062928
