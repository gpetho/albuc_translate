But nevertheless, you must alleviate the treatment of every weak eye in a natural way; and in the case of an accidental cause, by working with iron; and do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that this member is able to tolerate that procedure.	So must you do with superfluous flesh that arises in the eye. But you must avoid treating surgically any eye that is weak, whether congenitally or by acquired disease. Never set your hand to an operation of this kind till you have seen if the organ can endure such an operation.	0.739427
