On the treatment of hydrocele with varicocele.	On the treatment of hernia with varix.	0.7668234
Varicocele is a tortuous, somewhat twisted swelling, similar to a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.  The treatment of this disease is nearly the same as what has been mentioned previously.	A varix is a twisted tumour resembling a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, which makes movement and exercise and walking difficult for the patient. The treatment of this condition is of uncertain outcome, akin to those conditions just spoken of.	0.841189
However, it is necessary to describe the procedure as the ancients did. I say that it is necessary to sit the patient on a high chair, then push the scrotum downwards, then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels that are close to the penis.	Nevertheless we must describe the operation for this condition as it was performed by the Ancients. So I begin by saying that you must have the patient sitting upon a high seat; then push down the suspensor of the testicles and take hold of the skin of the testicles with your fingers together with the blood-vessels near the penis; then let your assistant take hold instead of you and draw out strongly.	0.85453904
And let another assistant hold it and stretch it tautly. Then, with a wide, sharp scalpel, make an oblique incision next to the vessels until the vessels are exposed. Then dissect them from every side, as I described to you in the chapter on dissecting the arteries in the temples. Then insert a needle with a double thread through them.	Then with a broad sharp scalpel make an oblique incision in the direction of the vessels so that the vessels are laid bare. Then dissect on all sides in the same way as I told you for extracting the temporal vessels.	0.7304168
And tie them at the beginning of the places where the varicocele appears, and tie them also at the end.  Then cut them in the middle with an incision lengthwise along the body, and drain the turbid, corrupt humors that have collected in them.	Then run through them a needle doubly threaded and tie at the spot where the varix begins and tie it again where the varix ends, then cut through the varix in the middle with an incision at right angles to the length of the body and draw out the turbid corrupt humidity that has gathered in it.	0.7930449
Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for wounds that you want to suppurate so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles fall off, and there is no harm in that. If the varicocele affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove one of the testicles with the vessels so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment. Because of cutting off the vessels, it withers and becomes useless.	Then dress the wound with the wound dressings usual where you wish to encourage suppuration, so that the vessels nourishing the one testicle may perish; there is no harm in that. But if all the vessels are varicose then you will have to remove one testicle with its vessels lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment through cutting into the vessels; for it will wither and be of no use.	0.8780068
