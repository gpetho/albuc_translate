Chapter Fifty.
On Cauterizing Cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it as you rotate. Some physicians have mentioned cauterizing it strongly in the middle, but I do not recommend that because I expect it will ulcerate, and I have seen that happen several times.
The correct way is to cauterize around it in a circle as we said, or with many cauterizations.
