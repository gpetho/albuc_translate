Chapter Twenty-Three on the Discussion of the Jaw
The jaw is a joint's dislocation from its place, thus hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing severe aches and pains to the patient.
So when a jaw dislocation occurs to someone, it is necessary to immediately reduce it without any delay, because if it is delayed, the place swells, making it difficult to reduce the jaw.
Therefore, it shouldn't be delayed, moved, or extended while it is swollen because it often causes convulsions and harmful pains to the patient.
But if this happens, it is necessary to immediately phlebotomize the patient, then leave it until the swelling subsides a little, then wash the limb with hot water and oil, then reduce it gently and treat each limb with what will be mentioned in its place.
I have also arranged the chapters on the jaw according to what was previously mentioned regarding fractures, from the top of the body to the bottom.
