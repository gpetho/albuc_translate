Of tentigo (a skin disease, likely referring to a sexually transmitted infection).
Tentigo is an extra growth of flesh on the genitals, so much so that it is very ugly to see;
and some women have it as big as a hand, and this is the treatment.
You must grasp the excess of the tentigo in your hand or with hooks, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, so that bleeding does not occur, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and there is another growth that arises at the opening of the vagina, and fills it, and sometimes protrudes, and has the appearance of a tail, and therefore the ancients called it "tailed malady".
So you must cut it, as we have described for the tentigo, and treat it until it is healed.
