The dislocation of the hand.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the wrist.	0.5533913
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints. However, it must be put back in place quickly, in the same hour that it is dislocated, before the area swells, or a hot abscess develops there.	The carpus of the hand is often dislocated. Unlike other joints, the reduction is easy, but there should be haste to reduce it as soon as it is dislocated, before the place swells or an abscess occur.	0.8172561
And the reduction is done by placing the injured hand on a table, and the practitioner extends the hand and aligns it evenly, placing their palm on the prominence of the joint, and pushes until it returns to place. However, you must check if it is correctly positioned; then the patient should put the back of their hand on a table during the extension and reduction.	The way of reducing the dislocation is to place the patient's wrist upon a board while an assistant stretches the hand, and the doctor puts the palm of his hand upon the prominence of the joint and applies pressure on it until it goes back.	0.78394884
And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient should place the back of their hand on the table, and the practitioner puts their hand on the prominence of the joint.	But he should examine: if it is a displacement toward the ventral aspect of the hand, the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board for extension and reduction; but if it be a luxation toward the dorsum of the hand, then the inner part of the hand should be laid upon the board so that the doctor's hand may come upon the prominence of the joint itself.	0.6613286
If it returns to place immediately, that is good. If not, then apply soothing plasters for hot abscesses, and leave it like that without trying again.	If it go back at once, good; but if not, bandage it with a plaster that settles swelling and let it be.	0.7290856
And if he cannot bear it, and you cannot put it back in place after a few days, the joint will remain crooked; and it does not harm the patient except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grip anything at all: then know that the nerves or arteries are cut; there is no other solution but to apply a cautery next to the injury, and perhaps nothing else will work.	Do not revert to it, for it will not tolerate that, and you will not be able to effect its reduction after some days have passed. But the joint will retain its deformity; and the patient will in no wise be harmed except if his hand is slackened so that he be unable to grip anything; then you may know that the tendons are either severed or bruised.	0.8458803
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster that we have mentioned, then bandage it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it like that.	When the reduction of the joint is complete, apply to it the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days; then loosen it and try out the hand.	0.8187828
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, moisten it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.	If movement be hampered and any hardness occur in it, soften it repeatedly with hot water and sweating until it be softened.	0.71567297
