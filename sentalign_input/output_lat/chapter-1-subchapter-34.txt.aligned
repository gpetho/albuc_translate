When there are one or more chronic haemorrhoids in the anus arising from thick and cold humours or corrupt humidities, and they have been treated by those measures mentioned in the section, without effect, then sear the patient with three cauterizations over the lowest dorsal vertebra a little below the flat part of the back, triangularly; and one about two fingers' breadth below the navel.	When there are old, multiple hemorrhoids in the anus, or even a single one, caused by thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and treatments have proven ineffective, cauterize with three cauteries on the lower vertebra of the back just below the waist in a triangular shape, and one cautery just two finger-widths below the navel.	0.8669387
And if you consider that his stomach has become chilled and his food not being digested, and you see his face swollen, then do one big cauterization over the stomach as previously described; and one over his liver; and another over the spleen; with the claviform cautery. Keep the burn open a long while; then dress till healed.	If you suspect the patient's stomach is chilled and food is undigested, and you notice swelling in the face, then cauterize over the stomach with a large cautery as previously described, and also over the liver and spleen using a nail-like cautery. Leave the cautery site open for a while, then treat it until healed.	0.83636117
