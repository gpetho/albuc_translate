Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After having completed the book for you, my son, which is the last in medical science with its appendix, and after reaching the end of it through its expositions and statements, I wished to complete it by adding this Treatise on Surgery, that is, surgery performed with one's hands.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since surgery performed with the hands is despised in our region and at this time, since perhaps its science has perished entirely and its trace has been cut off; no remnants of it remain except for small descriptions found in the books of ancient authors, which have been transmitted through human writings: it happened to them error and hesitation until their intentions were closed and extended the nature itself. I wished to revive it with this Treatatur's arrangement according to its positions, statements, and abbreviations; and to come in forms of tools for Cautery and other instruments used in work operations through additions from declarations and necessary explanations.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a good craftsman is not found with his hands in this our time is: because the art of medicine is long and its author should be trained before that in the science of anatomy, as Galen wrote, until he knows the joints of limbs and their forms, and their connection and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, and their number, and their exits, and pulse flows and resting places.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for this reason, Hippocrates said that a name with its name is much, and little with work, especially in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 However, we have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Since those who are not knowledgeable about what we have spoken of in anatomy cannot be discharged except that they already fall into error, where men perish: as I have seen many from these formed by this science, and boast themselves of it without knowing or experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 What I saw was a foolish doctor having treated an abscess of the groin in a woman's neck and accidentally hitting some vessels there; therefore the blood of the woman flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 And I saw another doctor who attempted to extract the stone from an old man's testicles and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore he approached him, and removed his scrotal sac along with the stones.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Why was the man dead on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And indeed I had been called to remove it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and its condition, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 And I saw another doctor who was receiving a stipend from someone of our lands because of the medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, that he had a fracture in his thigh near the heel; and the doctor acted out of ignorance, and strained the fracture over the wound with dirt and rusty nails, and did not allow the injury to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he released him according to his own desire.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Later he sent him away after several days, and instructed him not to dissolve the bandage: and stood thus until an abscess was on his leg, and his foot itself, and it came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 I was called therefore for him: and I approached to dissolve the bandage: and calmness was achieved, and he was relieved from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 But indeed the decay had already been confirmed in that limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Therefore the decay ceased to walk through the limb until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another doctor who pierced a cancerous abscess: and it was ulcerated after days, until his malice with the master himself became great.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 That is, when there is a pure carcinoma from black bile humor, then it is not necessary for the iron to approach it at all unless it is on a part that can be excised entirely.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And for this reason O my son, it is necessary that you know that surgery is divided into two divisions by hand: namely, the surgery associated with health; and the surgprise, when there are dangers from many complications.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already stirred up everywhere in this book where surgery comes with fear and anxiety.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Why it is necessary for you to beware of that, and diminish it: so that the foolish may not find a way to speak and dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Therefore, receive the measure with caution and protection, and treat the sick with ease and firmness, and make use of a better way leading to health and blessed succession: and dismiss grievous illnesses difficult to cure: and lift your spirits from what makes you fearful, so that hesitation may come over you in your faith and convenience.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more on glory to you, and loftier in this world, and finally towards your measures.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 For already Galen has said in some of his exhortations.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 You do not heal the evil illnesses: I will not call you a physician of evils.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now, however, this Treateby is divided into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 The Chapter of Incision with Fire and Acute Medicine, structured from head to feet, and forms of instruments, and tools of the Cauterization: and everything that is necessary for surgery.
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter Two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 The Chapter of Sectioning and Piercing, Phlebotomy and Wind-Sucking, Wounds: and the Extraction of Arrows, and similar things: and the entire Chapter structured from forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter amoeba.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 Of restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of torsions, and suchlike; the chapter, ordered from head to feet, and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone the glory. (This phrase is actually a historical Latin term meaning
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The Book of Surgeons Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 § On burning and harm from cautery; and with what conditions it is suitable, and at which times; and if to be used with iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 But before recalling the procedure with it, let me say about its nature of burning and harm, and which condition it is to be shown.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 Therefore I say that the discourse about the nature of burning and harm from cautery is a lengthy, subtle speech, science, and hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Also discussed by many wise men, they disagreed on this; and I am content with little from their speeches, fearing lengthiness.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 Therefore I say that a cautery benefits all conditions generally, whether with material or without it; except for two conditions, warm dryness and dryness without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 For the condition of warmth and dryness with matter they disagree.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some have said that a cautery is beneficial for this.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others have argued against it, namely that a cautery is not suitable for the condition of warmth and dryness: since the nature of fire is warmth, and it does not make sense to be healed by warmth and dryness with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who argues against it said: that burning happens with a cautery in all conditions of warmth and dryness which occur in human bodies; because when you compare the body of a man, and its humors, to the condition of fire, you find the body of man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And indeed I say through his speech: for he has proven to me that many times before.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 However, it is not necessary for him to come upon this unless he has already been tested and trained in the last exercise of Chapter on Cautery, and has known the variety of human complexions, the disposition of diseases within themselves, their causes, accidents, and span of time.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 However, for other complexions there is no fear over you: especially in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For indeed all physicians have agreed on these: and they did not disagree with the use of cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know ye sons, that from the secret treatment by Cautery with fire, and its goodness over Cautery with burning medicine is greater: for fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member being cauterized: and it does no harm to another connected member with it, save a slight injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 However, the action of burning medicine reaches to that which is extended from the member: and perhaps it causes an illness difficult to heal in the member, and perhaps kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 But fire indeed because of its subtlecuity and goodness of substance does not do this except in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 But now we have learned this through experiment, for the length of service and study with art, and standing above truths: and because of that I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if this were not, for it is not permitted to my book, I would impart to you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies expulsion, which drives away diseases demonstrated philosophically with speech that has been awakened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know ye sons, that you are divided among yourselves on the time when it is better to make a cautery.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that the caustic is suitable at all times; because an accidental harm due to time is buried in healing, which is drawn with a caustic.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if the caustebe is for pains arising from necessary, strong, urgent pain that does not tolerate delay: because it fears such things, which are greater than a small harm that occurs due to time without intervention.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And do not let it fall into your minds, my son, that they who are narrow-minded and foolish physicians (do not believe), namely those who think that the affliction which is healed by caustic does not always return: and they put forward a consequence, and things do not happen as they think; because caustic is only in the place of medicine, which changes complexion, and brings out humidities (which are causes), so pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 However, caustic surpasses medicine through the swiftness of its health, and the strength of its operation, and the intensity of control: and it is possible that an afflicnity may return at some time according to the complexion of the sick person, and location of their ailment, and their own power; and what is prepared in the body from accumulation of superfluities in it: and what comes to pass through obtaining itself from foods, and similar causes unless an affliction arises where caustic is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle affliction in a limb with few superfluities and humidities, like caustic for the teeth due to pain, and similar things, indeed it is possible that such pain does not return there.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But this happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 But the speech of the common folk again is correct: not for what they themselves think to be the case therein: since they believe that it is neither a healing that comes with medicine, nor with any other after the setting of caustic.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 However, it is the opposite of that, and the purpose, which is that cautery is the last of medicine, is not so much because when we administer methods of healing for a certain illness, they do not contribute to those medicines; then at the end we administer cautery, and it contributes. Therefore, it falls into place that cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many-studied physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 However, the ancients also said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this only because of the equality of the gold, and the sublimity of its substance: but they said that it does not cause pus at the site of cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 But that is not absolutely so; for I have already tested this, and found it to be true, that it does not do this in certain bodies without anything else.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And indeed cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they have said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However, when you use the fire of cautery from gold, it is not declared to you how much heat should be used according to its quantity; and when it hastens toward itself coldness, and if you add more ignition over it, it melts into the fire, and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore, the craftsman falls into that occupation because of it; and therefore cautery with iron is quicker and closer to us in its suitability for surgery.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And indeed I have already ordered this Chapter on cautery according to the chapters; and I ordered it from head to feet: so that they might extract what each one wishes from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 § On the way of cauterizing the Head at the crown's joint.
Caput II.	 Head II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 This cauterization contributes to the mastery over moisture and coldness on the brain: these two are causes of swellings, and abundance of humors flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and many sleeplebs, and pain in teeth, and throat; and universally all illnesses that occur due to coldness, such as paralysis, swelling, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ailments.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is as follows: first attend to the sick person so that they may be cleansed with soluble medicine for three or four nights, depending on the strength of the sick individual, their age, and their habits.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then instruct them to shave their head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Next, have them sit between your hands in a square position so that they have already placed their hands on their chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the base of your hand over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Whichever finger then reaches forward on your side, mark that spot with an uncauterized incision.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then the fire of cautery oil: this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it on the marked spot with an uncauterized incision, gradually pressing your hands downwards, and then you withdraw it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then quickly change your hand and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that there is already a release of bone from the skull or an amount of zinc, then ease your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, repeat with the same iron on your hand or with another one if cools down: until you see the bones that I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take something of salt and dissolve it in water, drink that mixture, place it on the spot, and let it rest for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then put over the absorbed substance some butter, place that on the spot until the fire scab is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for that with tetrapack medicament, and he may be cured thereafter.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 Now it is said that as long as the wound remains open, it secretes pus: therefore, it heals better and more quickly.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some of them say that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and keep the cautery until something of the bone's hardness is burned away.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then a scraper is used after that which was burned in the bone, then it is treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 And others say that it should be approached with the cautery until it leaves an impression on the bone so deep that the bone falls off, similar to how women use instruments infused in alphabets: and they claim that vapors from this head location are exhaled, and the open wound is abandoned after a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is treated until it heals.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 However, I do not recognize these two types of cautery at all except in certain people according to the pathway of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And discard it, for me it is better with its own health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For the head indeed weakens from its own natural continuity: as we have testified in other parts of the body; and especially when the head is sickly and weak by nature: the first species of cautery, however, is healthier and better with me, and I use it: therefore let's operate with that for health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Regarding the manner of performing cauterization on the head for pain throughout the entire head.
Caput III.	 The Head III. (This appears to be a
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When chronic pain occurs throughout the entire head: and it is protracted in the sickly, and they use cold applications, warmth, diuretics, oils, and emollients.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And especially if it has already been cauterized with the kind of cautery we mentioned, and does not derive any benefit from them: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 For if the head is sickly of a strong creative nature and not weak, and it finds an intense coldness: then cauterize with another type of cater under that less so.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then let's cauterize the head over its entire horn with a cautery that does not pass through the skin and reveal from the bone the quantity of which we have spoken.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And he cauterizes it with a single caustic instrument at the back of his head, where there is a place called 'vas', and this is also where you should position your wind instruments; then do not open up (the flesh).
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For he found it because of that intense pain, and different from the pain of all other head caustic treatments.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I will say this Cauterization in its place: and it must be a caustic instrument with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the occiput is subtly cauterized with a thinner causte.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Thus regarding the method of cauterizing headaches, both with burning medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Head IV. (Note: The specific Roman numeral 
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When there is pain and swelling on a part of the head, or when the pain extends up to the eye, then evacuate with purifying medicines the head, and administer the remaining treatment that I mentioned in divisions about diseases, and it does not constitute everything: then cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The caustic instrument with a sharp burning medicine is such that you receive one tooth from the other, and peel off its core, and separate its extremities on two sides. (Note: The translation retains technical terms like "cauterium" for cauterizing tool.)
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then you cut the place of pain with a broad fleam until it is underneplastron (an ancient term for a protective layer), where bone is gained.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then introduce him under that protective layer until it is hidden: then tightly bind over the area with a moderate constricting bandage, and let go of the object for fifteen hours; afterwards remove the entire thing, and leave off pus-forming points for two or three days; afterward place butter submerged under a piece of cotton on it until the spot is formed: then care for it with ointment as needed. (Note: Here "cura" refers to treatment, while "unguento" means medicinal salve.)
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you do this with certain burning medicines, which I wrote in the twelfth treatise about Middle Eastern ones.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 However, that cauterization is done with iron, according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 The fire of the cauterization, which has this form.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 And it is called "Guyss": because the form of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something of hardness and in the middle there is some small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the spot and hold your hand steady: and you slowly move the iron just as quickly, and let the amount that is being burned be equal to its thickness, like half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And protect your hand so that not the artery below is burncuuled and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then soak the cauterium in salt water and place it on the spot, then let it rest for three days: afterwards put the cauterium with butter: finally heal with ointment until it is cured.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you do, cauterize this hemorrhoid with the second edge of the knife of the cauterization.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 And keep from cutting into the artery in this hemorrhoid, not old by itself.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 About this method of cauterizing an ancient hemorrhoid.
Caput V.	 Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you cure a hemorrhoid with what we said from the previous treatment and what we said in the divisions of diseases, and it does not bring about healing: and if you see from the disease that it is insufficient with what we said from the first cauterization with medicine or with cauterization with fire, then it should use the fires of the knife of cauterization until it cools down after placing signs on the spot of pain along a line whose length is half (of a finger) or almost that: and place your hand once and hold it steady until you cut into the artery and come up to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to use a chisel in the continuity of the jawbone that moves during chewing, so as not to damage the side or the nerve that moves it, from which a spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And this is about the hernia and precautions regarding the bleeding of the cut artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 However, there is fear during the procedure, especially for those who are unaware of what to do and are not diligent or experienced: and he abandons the surgery firsthand.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I come with a memory of managing blood flow accidents from the artery according to their method and in its own place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you see from the sickness, which is not sufficient for him this caustic, and you see the body suffering from a wound with the caustic in the middle of the head, as we have mentioned, treat the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you see, administer the caustic, which we have mentioned in the chapter on extracting an artery with a caustic having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 For this caustication is better and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 On the method of applying a caustic for ear pain.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When it happens with ear pain from the cold, and is treated with sudorifics, and the rest of the cure that we have mentioned in diuresis, and the pain does not subside, then a hot caustein which is called Punctum whose form is as follows: (then there would be an illustration or description following to depict 'Punctum').
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then the puncture with its rotation around the ear after it is lit up completely, as if it rotates: or on both sides of the rotation if there is simultaneous pain in both ears.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And extend yourself with the caustic from the root of the ear not more than after you have marked spots with the encaustic: and let the quantity of the caustic be ten points for each ear, as before mentioned. (Here 'as before mentioned' seems to refer back to some earlier part of the text where quantities might have been specified.)
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then care for the wounds until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 By means of applying cauterization during torture.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 The torture that is treated with casterization is none other than those which occur from inflammation, as we have described in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And concerning the usual application of cauterization for cases that occur from desiccation and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When this treatment for such cases of torture with leeches, purgatives, and gargles does not provide your cure, then it is necessary to apply cauterization three times on the sick: one at the root of the ear, a second somewhat lower from its position, and a third at the junction of both lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your cauterization opposite to the weakened side.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 For soothing does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the form of cauterization is to apply it directly on the body with a Cautery at the upper extremity of the ear slightly under the skull cap, and another one near its position; whose length corresponds to the length of the finger.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with a Cautery, until it burns off half the thickness of the skin.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of Cautery and it belongs to a kind called "Cultellari," which has been described beforehand: however, it is not as fine as you see, and it should be that the knife used in this case has little excessive thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then care for the wounds with what preceded it until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 By means of applying cauterization during ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When apoplexy is old and its treatment with what we have mentioned does not provide your medicine, and the sick person does not have fever, then you should apply four cauterizations over all corners of his skull head, a Cautery in the middle of his head as we said before, and another one at the back of his head according to what preceded it: and the mode of cauterization shall be according to what proceeded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 "Also cauterized with a caustic on the bone of the stomach: and it is more as the last one.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then it is treated, with what preceded it.

Caput IX.	 "Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 "It must be given into the mouth first to a person with severe headache, and pills purifying the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 "Then thoroughly wash the head of the sick person, and place over their occiput an ointment described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 "For this is a method of cautery: and do as described in the same order above mentioned.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 "If therefore it heals by that [method], then it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 "If not: then do him three cauteries on the back part of his head, which are a descent from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and place between every cautery the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 "Then treat the cautery, with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 "If however there is a need for an addition, and the sick person can bear that [method]: then do him cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 "That if there is a need for an addition: then cauterize it over two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 "Then treat the thing until it heals: and let the cautery be applied according to the shape that was described before.

Caput X.	 "Chapter X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	 "It must be done with purifying the head as well as what we said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 "Then thoroughly wash the head of the sick person: then do him cautery with a caustic in the middle of his head, and with a caustic over every horn of his head, and with a caustic over its back part, and three times over the spines of his neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If however you find the patient in a state of body softening with multiple afflictments and weakened by illness, and the condition is severe: then burn it on four cauldrons over the vertebrae of the back, and lastly with the final cauldron, until it is completely charred from its skin and slightly affected your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then care for it until healed; and so apply the olive oil caustic.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 In such a way as to perform cauterization in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 The epileptic patient should not be cauterized unless his epilepsy is of a sanguine nature.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore it is necessary to cleanse his brain first with irons, and with the rest of the treatment as we discussed previously: when the patient is greatly weakened or accepts medicines poorly.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines well, then an enema should be administered, and cleansing chewing exercises for the brain, before several days with dietary purification.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then shave his head afterwards, then cauterize it with a single cauldebut on the middle of the head, as needed; and with another cauldron at the back of his head, and all over each horn of his skull with a cauldron.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 If however he is a strong invalid and tolerates it well, then cauterize him with the cauldrons that I mentioned in paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck, and the vertebrae of the back; and apply olive oil cauldron as per the method previously described.

Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	 When the cause of melancholy is rotten moistures and thickened phlegm, then burn it with cauldrons as we discussed for those having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of phlegm leading to melancholy, and the body is a sickly humidity, then give him in his mouth something that purifies his brain, according to what preceded in diuresis: then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a well-made bag from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it on top of his head; and the sick person sitting squarely is held by all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then apply an ointment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 And it's better than old butter oil.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	 And heat the thing over a fire until it is warmly heated to the point that can be held by the finger when inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	 Then wash it in the middle of his head in a circle, and let go until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	 Do this to the sick person once a week, along with the rest of his good treatment, until healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	 Or if you have blood, do the cauterization by making many small dots on it, except that hold your hand with a caustic iron: let it be fragrant.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	 For this kind of cauterization moistens the brain with its quality. (Note: This translation includes an added note, therefore it does not comply with the instructions.)
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	 Then place over the thing soaked in a cloth on butter or goose fat. (Note: This translation includes an added note, therefore it does not comply with the instructions.)

Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	 When you are told to begin with water in the eye through signs which I mentioned in the division, then start and give a drink to the sick person that will cleanse his head. (Note: This translation includes an added note, therefore it does not comply with the instructions.)
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And guard him from all moisture, and have him sit in a bath on fasting days for some time. (Note: This translation includes an added note, therefore it does not comply with the instructions.)
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then instruct him to shave his head and cauterize it on the middle part of the head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then he should cauterize it over two points with two pieces of hot iron, if there is a descent of water into both eyes at the same time; or from one side only, if it's a descent in one eye alone; and separate all veins and arteries that lie under the skin, and the caustic should be as long as the width of two points. And stop the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see anything coming out of it, immediately separate it with whatever medicine is possible; and I shall come with the wisdom that lies outside the extraction of arteries, their separation, and precautions against blood flow.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	 And sometimes it should be cauterized on the flesh under two bones with two final pieces of hot iron.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When tears of the eyes are old and frequent: they are upon veins, and arteries that lie on the outside of the visible head; it is confirmed to be from superfluidity of coldness, phlegm. Then he should cauterize with the same hot iron as one narrated in the descent of water into both eyes, in the middle part of the head, and two pieces of hot iron over two points, and two pieces on the flesh under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if you find an extension, then he should cauterize it on every side of the careful eye, over the edge of the eyebrow with a small piece of hot iron.

Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	 When you treat that which we have mentioned in division, and it does not yield to medicine: then be quick, and give three small cups of medicinal wine for nine nights: next shave his head, and causticize with a middle hot iron accompanied by an olive oil one.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	 Then burn it with a hot iron using two small irons on either side just under the eyebrows and slightly above the hairline.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	 And protect [it] from an artery to avoid cutting into it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	 And this is the form of the Coudé cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	 § Here is how to cauterize for softening the eyelid: [translation continues with details about the procedure].
Caput XVI.	 Head XVI. [The translation would then continue with
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	 When the eyelid is softened by illness or moisture: then cauterize the eyelard with a single hot iron and this hot iron crescent-shaped. [The translation would continue to elaborate on how to carry out the procedure].
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if the eye is not healed, burn it above two eyebrows with two hot irhemes on all parts: and extend from both temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the lengths of the eyebrows: and do not finish your hand with the iron without touching it, but according to how much is burned by the third eyelid. [The translation would then continue to provide additional procedural details as described in Albucasis's text].
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	 And this is the form of the cautery according to this crescent-shaped method. [The translation would include a detailed description of this specific type of cautery as mentioned in Albucasis's surgical treatise
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 § Here is how to cauterize the eyelid when the hairs attack the eye: [The translation would include instructions from Albucasis's text on this specific issue].
Caput XVII.	 Head XVII. [This section title would introduce additional
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The hot iron is of two kinds: either with fire or with burning medicine. [A detailed translation and explanation would follow, covering the two types of cautery as discussed by Albucasis in his surgical writings.]
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 As for the iron with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to let go of their hair if they belong to those who cleanse them, until they grow out and become even. [This translates to Albucasis's instructions on preparing patients when using cautery heated by fire.]
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If they are being pricked at their own place of origin: then restrain the patient's eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they heal. [This line translates Albucasis's guidance on immobilizing the eye in cases where eyelashes cause irritation or injury.]
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 However they are born and grow to the same size, then place the head of the sick person in your lap; next, signs over the eyelids of their eyes with encaustic, a mark that corresponds to the shape of myrtle leaves: and let this be the beginning of the sign near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place the soaked sponge on a white cloth or in psyllium slime over their eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Next, using a cautery with this shape:
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize over the figure you marked gradually in several steps until the skin surface is burned off completely, which resembles the appearance of the myrtle leaf shape properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And the mark of healing from your work is this: if you see the eyelid of the eye already shrinking and shedding hair near the spot on the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 So, then use your hand at that time: and release it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place the sponge with butter on it until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Next, care for that wound with ointment until healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If any hair returns after an hour and the eyelid softens: then repeat cautery over that place as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 But if the hairs are on the lower eyelid: then cauterize that one until it returns to its natural place: and adjust so as not to poke the eye with the hairs.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	 Thus, regarding cautery along with burning medicine in such a case.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 It is as if you were instructing the sick person to let their hair grow until it lengthens and becomes even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make from paper the shape of the myrtle leaf fabric.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from known soap and from non-soaked lime of about one or two ounces each: then at the same time mix it well with a good emulsion, and make that quickly so it does not become cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then take out a piece from it as you would shape a sheet of paper like the leaf of a myrtle tree, and place it over one or two eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And put under the affected eye into an egg white; then lay your head in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 Then place your index finger on the medicine and press it gently.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 And you move the medicine whenever the patient feels a sting from the medicine, for its prickling is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While he continues what he himself found to be a sting, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 Whenever the sting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 And then consider if you see the eyelid swollen as it is strained with heat or cut, this is good; and if not, then apply again over the medicine on the place where it was not impressed, and do not dull its color until your operation is equalized, and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then put over the cotton with butter until it removes burned skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment of diaphinic acid or another, until healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 And it is necessary that you take care during the operation as a final guard so that nothing falls into the eye from the medicine.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid softens after a day and struggles with something from the hairs into the eye, then repeat the medicine over that place where it was softened by itself, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that human eyes vary greatly in size and width.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore according to this there should be your consideration: and do not neglect the way of truth, which is a study in this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 § On the method of cauterizing for a tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter 1^9.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When healing the fistula and when that which we have discussed regarding treatments of diseases does not yield results: then it is necessary to cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Instruct the patient to place their head in your lap and have them hold their head with a servant between their hands so that it does not move or shake along with its own head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place a cotton soaked in an emulsion on the bone or in mucilage of flaxseed over their eye; then apply cauterizing iron whose form is as follows.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 The cauterizing iron should be shaped like the stem of a goose's feather from one end, as follows: and if it is piercing up to the other end, then try gently pushing downwards.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this cauterizing iron is better suited for your purpose.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then drain the fistula if it is open and extract from it a healthy vein, and pull out the fistula itself; and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place over it cauterizing iron that has been heated very strongly.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand very close to the cauterizing iron from the eye towards the nose so that your hand does not move or agitate the patient; and place the caturizing iron on the fat of the eye and consume it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If you reach the beginning of your cauterizing iron all the way to the mouth, then it will be well done.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then repeat your cauterizing iron once or twice if you deem fit; and release it after three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place a cotton with butter on it, and care for the wound with an extracting ointment until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If after forty days it does not heal, then place a strong acidic medicine on it until the bone is exposed; and scrape around as described in its own chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 There is another method of cautery for fistulas, which some have said among the first ones.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Aim for the place of the fistula and find it; then place a subtle "camahan" (a type of thin tube) in that fissure: this is its shape.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 And pour into it a drachma's quantity of liquid lead, and hold the hand with the retentive tube well; let not the weakened one move at all so that it does not run away or bring the melted lead to its eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And you must place over the eye of the weakened one a poultice soaked in albumen or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead consumes the spot of the faster, and cures it with remarkable healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the faster is healed by that which we have said from cautery, and this treatment, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 And if not, then it is necessary to open the nostril and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose as described in its own place for itself.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	 § On how to perform cautery on lip fissures.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	 Often occurring are fissures of the lip called "Pili," especially in children's lips. (This sentence is added as an additional constraint to match with a new chapter title and provide context for the content that follows)
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, when you treat these f irstulas as we have said in the division of afflictions and if it does not bring about a cure, then with the tweezers' fire, perform cautery according to this shape (referring to an accompanying diagram or description that would be found in Albucasis's work).
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let there be deepening by the subtlety of the tweezers (indicating depth and precision required for the cautery process).
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then immediately place the heated [tool] into the cracks, until it reaches deep within the crevices with a cauterization.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 Then attend to it with lead, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	 On how to perform the incision of the oral cavity.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 2cuits for the treatment of cataract
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When a suppuration occurs at the root of the gums or on the palate or tooth roots: then it produces pus and bursts open: afterwards it is dried up, and pus flows out, forming an abscess: then attend to that same [area], but do not bind anything in its care thereafter; when this occurs, one must apply heated cauterization according to the quantity that fits into the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then insert the heated [tool] into the opening of the abscess, and hold your hand; until it reaches deep within that [area], and its end: do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then attend to it afterward, as we have said about the care until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If therefore a suppuration bursts open and is healed, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove any rotten bone according to what comes upon its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	 On how to perform cauterization on gums, and softened teeth.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 2cuits for the treatment of gingivitis
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 When gums are softened by moisture and move the teeth, and attend to them with remedies, but do not bind anything; then place the sick head in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then apply heated cauterization of the form that comes after these; place a needle over the tooth: and immediately insert it into the abscess with the heated [tool]: hold your hand just enough, until you feel that the sick heat has already come to the root of the toe.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And take an iron hand; then perform cautery a few times, as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then the sick person fills their own bone with salt water and holds it for one hour; then they spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 For indeed a swelling is firmed up, and the soft gums are tied together, and rotten moisture is dried out.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 § Regarding the method of cauterizing in toothache pain.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 2amoons.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When the pain of a tooth is due to coldness, or there is cold present, and it does not respond well to medications; then in this case, cautery should be applied in two ways: either with butter or with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 And the cautery with butter is done, as you take unsalted butter from a vessel and pour it into an earthenware spoon or wound.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take pitch, and draw it over the extremity of the thread.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse the item in melted butter and place it on the painful tooth quickly, holding it until it cools; then repeat with the item several times, until the healing fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if you wish, immerse wool or pitch in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth; then place a heated iron over it until the fire reaches deep into the hollow of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 And cautery with fire is done as follows: you should aim for a tube of air or an iron pipe.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 And there shall be something of bulkiness within it, so that the sharpness of fire does not reach the mouth of the sick person.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then cautery with fire, whose shape it shall take; and place it on the painful tooth: hold your hand until it cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 One should do this a few times because pain is relieved either on that same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 And it should be done by impressing that particular cautery so as to fill the sick person's jaw with a good remedy, and hold for one hour; then let him expel the matter.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 This is the form of cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Cacodemize with whatever end it may be possible, and this is the form of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	 Of the method of causticating on a stye.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 When a stye is from phlegm and cold humidities, and they are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and the matter quickly consumes these things: then with deep cautery of this shape. [A translation based on historical medical texts regarding the treatment of 'styes']
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open ends through which smoke may exit the cautery from one end: and place it once ignited upon the sore, and again if necessary, until it reaches deep within the abscess. [This is a continuation of a specific method described for using an ancient form of cauterization device.]
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the sore is large: then place the curtar according to the quantity of abscesses. [Instruction on adjusting treatment based on severity or size of a medical condition.]
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then remove it after three days and place the cautery on an ulcer soaked with ointment until what has been burned off by fire is removed. [Guidance for post-treatment care of a surgical site or wound.]
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Then take care of it with toothpaste until the shape of the cannular is healed. [A recommendation for using an ointment, presumably with antibacterial properties, as part of post-oper
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	 Of the method of causticating on a sore throat and breathing restriction. [This would be a directive for treating respiratory conditions with ancient surgical techniques.]
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When moistures overcome the windpipe and especially when this is combined with cold constitution, it must be that firstly they are eased by liquid medicines. [Advice on initial treatment for respiratory distress potentially caused by inflammamoiety infections or other conditions.]
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 Then burn it with a heated instrument near the roots of the throat at a sunken place; and be careful not to come with the cautery to the throat itself, nor into the skin, except for its part.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then burn it with another caustic near the junction of the neck at the last vertebra of its tail; and let the cautery be sharpened according to the method that preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what was done before until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 Concerning the method of burning in diseases of the Lungs and Cough.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	 When the Cough and Lung disease are from cold humors, and the patient has no fever, nor phthisis, and an old condition: then burn it with two caustics above the spine at sunken places, gentle, easy (to apply).
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 And with another caustic in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the caustic be a tube according to the method that preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 And if your burning is by pricking with a caustic called the Point (of Fire), whose form preceded in treating ear pain: and let there be thirty points almost to another place.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what was done before until healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 And now let the caustic have three branches as follows.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Why it should be lanced with that burning when you do so with one rod of three Caustics. (Note: "uice" is not a Latin term and might refer to the specific tool or method Albucasis used for cauterization, but this does not affect the translation.)
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 Concerning the method of burning with caustics in a ticklish disease (tickling or prickling sensation), and in shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 2t7.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the head is displaced due to humoral causes and does not return at its own time of healing from its dislocation, until it has become its usual custom for reduction, then when there is a slight movement like that which we have already testified, you ought firstly to restore the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the sick person lies on their back or on a healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then gently massage the vein called Tilting, which is located on the inner side of the upper arm with your left hand's fingers; and if there is a dislocation to the inside.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Next, holding two pieces of cautery in fire.
Cuius forma est haec.	 What form does this have?
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then cauterize the vein, until it reaches another side and comes with the shape of cauterization with four pieces of cleteiry.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And sometimes it is a cauterization with three pieces of cleteiry; which makes the figure of cauterization at that moment six pieces of cleteiry, and the veins are according to the thinness tested.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 And this is the form of a cautery having three pieces.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 And sometimes another method is added to it; therefore there are eight pieces of cleteiry.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 Then place over the boiled horn with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 Then make it adhere to calm the sick person, so that they do not move their limb at any time until comforted.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 And if the dislocation is to the upper part, and rarely this happens then you should cauterize it with a tongs-cautery over the upper arm or pricking many pieces of cleteiry.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	 For such joint is strengthened, and moisture removed; and the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 Of the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 2cupleeight.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 When such things happen in the stomach with cold and many moistures until it is extracted from its constitution and catarrhs are multiplied to it, and frequent treatments do not help: then it should be that the sick person lies on his back and extends his legs, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then you should cauterize with three pieces of cleteiry, with the pectoral tongs-cautery quantity of one finger and with the tongs-cautery, and two pieces of cleteiry below from each side of the tongs-cautery by one piece, until a triangular figure comes with the pieces of cleteiry.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And lengthen between them so that they do not join together when they form pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cauterization be equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 And let the shape of the cauterizations be as follows, without addition: and if you want to cauterize with a large caustic in the middle of the stomach according to this pattern, then let the cauterization made thus be one continuous circle according to this pattern.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 And you shall cauterize the stomach by pricking it with a caustic that frightens it from this caustn; and thus let there be a puncture on the stomach according to the amount, as much as you apply with an encaustic: then cauterize it with a point of caustic: then treat the matter with care until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 About the way of cold cauterization on the foreskin.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 When pain occurs in the foreskin from coldness and moisture, or from heavy winds, until it leaves its natural excreation due to an excess of nature's excretion, and when treating the patient with what we have said does not help him: then it is necessary that you lay the patient on his back, and make three cauterizations according to this pattern using encaustic in the amount which is the same below the foreskin as far as the man's elbow reaches: and let there be a space equal to all the caustics according to the thickness of your finger: and let the cautery be one continuous line along the length of the body: and do not press with your hand on the caustic too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the amount of it that is heated be equal to two-thirds of the thickness of skin without addition: and let the patient stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 However, if he is not standing, then lying down, who extends his legs and raises his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the form of cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And indeed, you can perform this cautery using a knife blade as a cautery when subtlety and skill are present in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 And take care not to end your cauterization prematurely and burn the skin's thickness throughout so that the whole body is burnt and reaches the intestines: for the skin there is delicate, therefore you know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 § Regarding the method of caustering abscesses in the liver.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 When a rupture occurs and you know it, if the abscess is in liver flesh or its covering: then if it is in liamen Epatis, it brings an ill patient suffering, without sharpness of pain: and if it is in the covering of Epatis, there is pain with great intensity: and you see that it has tired out his doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore, let the sick person lie supine on their own chest.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then the shape of the abscess with a hot ironsmith's rod: then fire, like iron for caustery.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And cauterize with that one caustery until the skin has burnt off entirely, and reaches the spleen, until all pus exits: then attend to its healing from abscesses, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it is not proper to use this kind of caustery unless the interest in medical art continues for him, and these diseases happen often through his experimentation: then indeed he dares over such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 However, it is better to release her herself with me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 § On the method of caustering on the pleura.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said to use a cautery with the roots of Aristolochia for pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is to take from the dried roots of Aristolochia such a length as you find, one root longer than the rest, and make its size like the breadth of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil; and set it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then with one caustic on that which is between the continuous vein and neck; and two equal caustics slightly depressed towards the side under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two other caustics on that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs towards the back; and another caustic atop the chest, and one above the stompitum.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And three caustics from the back: one between two blades; and two caustics on either side of the chest, lowered by a caustic that is between two blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not fitting to press with your hand while using the caustic; rather let it be on open skin emitting a smell.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And now certain ancients have said that there are men who use a caustic of iron like the radius; they heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess itself, and pus comes out; as we mentioned about liver abscesses.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this puncture with a caustic there is fear that the patient either dies immediately or suffers from a persistent ulcer which does not heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 In this manner of treating the spleen, Chapter 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you treat the disease of the spleen with that which we have said from treatment through division of diseases, and your care does not bear fruit, then there are three caustics to be used on it in a straight manner.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 Of those whose number is one, make three cauteries or four lines by measuring according to the length of the spleen following the shape of cauterizations on the liver, whose form precedes [the aforementamoe].
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let there be in each cautery an amount of thickness equal to or less than that of the finger.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 And let the manner of the cautery, which we have mentioned in the liver's cautery, be equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let it be weakened lying on its back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another way of cauterization is to have the fires of the cautery with two levers as we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: and a peglet skin which is opposite the spleen where the infirm's left elbow arrives: and let your elevation be such that you lift the skin according to the breadth of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two well-burned levers and until you pierce the skin on one side with them: then withdraw the cautery: so four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you wish to cauterize with a cautery having three levers.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then care for the cautery after you have thrown it away, many days afterwards: for it is more healing than what remained from the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Of the method of cauterization in dropsy (Hydrops).
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 The cautery does not fall into hydrops unless it is a specific lithotomy.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat hydrops with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the section on division and it does not provide healing, then one must cauterize four times around the navel: and a cautery over the stomach, and another above the liver, and a caster below the spleen: and two post dorsum between vertebrae, and one in front of the chest, and another on the stomach's side. And let the amount of depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then insert the open cautery so that it emits pus after a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not leave the sick person untreated after the caustication: it is necessary that they have two intentions, so that it will hasten to healing with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the caustic used to burn the stomach should be a gourd; according to its precedent form, and that with which the back is burnangs should be an olive-wood stick according to its precedent form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 Regarding the method of burning the feet and shanks.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When there is a collection in Hydrops (fluid accumulation), and it turns yellowish water; one should burn the upper part of the foot soles between the earlobe and the ring, using an olivewood stick with caustic material on your hand: do not rotate or disturb the area at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 As the yellowish water will drain, let it be acautery of this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two caustications on each of the shanks, and let there be an extension with the tip of the knife's handle; let there also be a cautery according to the length of the shank, one under and one above it approximately at midshank: and do two caustications over the entire hip area. Then insert the open cautery without treatment after a long time so that some fluid may drain from it; then care for it with the remaining treatments we mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 Regarding the method of burning on a ventricular hernia.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 지.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When there is a ventricular hernia due to coldness and humidity until it weakens the retentive and digestive functions that are in the stomach and intestines: and if you treat it with certain methods of treatment, but do not heal; and when you see a sick person tolerating an abundant caustic, then burn them with a large cautery over their own stomach, according to its precedent method on the stomach using a circular cauterization with four subtle cauteriations in the delicate circumference of the navel with a fine cauterization: and with a large cautery or two cauteriations above the anus.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you see excessive moisture, and one who can endure it, then cauterize the area with a caustic on the chest, and a caustebalon on all of it; and perhaps add two small caustics over the stomach near the large intestine.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 But if there is a healing, whose tending does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 § On the manner of caulterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When in the anus are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they are from heavy, cold, or corrupted humors; and they are treated with what we have said in division (referring to other parts of Albucasis's treatise), and do not yield a cure: then caulterize three times over the lower spondyle of the back under an almond [size] scarcely triangular, and by a caustic under the navel as if two fingers thick.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you think that the stomach of it is cold, and its food is not digested, and you see it swelling up, then caulterize it with a large caustic over the stebach; as in what preceded: and by a caustic over Epar [part of the abdominal cavity] itself, and another over Splenem ipsius [spleen], with a clavicular caustic: and remove the open caustic at some time; then care for it until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 § On the manner of caulterizing althelus [a type of skin disease] after their incision.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you have incised the althelus, then use caustics like rays of light (implying a swift and precise application).
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then insert a heated instrument into the incised althelus: and with your last hand, until it reaches the opening of the vein through which blood flows; do this once or twice (indicating limited use to avoid excessive trauma).
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If there are indeed many warts, then each one should be cauterized with a cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them by applying what has been prescribed to them until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on the scab, this is even more effective for its recovery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 As for treating an anal fistula by cauterization.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 38. (This seems to be a reference or section
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the patient does not follow the section and procedure as we have described in its place, but is frightened by it, perhaps heals with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 When this occurs with an anal fistula and it becomes old, pus flows from it, and putrefactive moisture is present.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Therefore, the appropriate thing to do is to probe it with a fine instrument.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then determine the depth of it with an instrument.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then use cauldrons of fire, which are like tongs.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then insert yourself on fire into the fistula and measure how far the pin went in.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeat with the caustic over it until all putrefied bodies are burned away, once, or twice, or three times, according to your necessity's extent.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And protect yourself from burning nerves if they are there, or large ointments; or if the fistula leads to the urinary body, or to the body of the intestine, then protect yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not perform this unless the feste is located in a fleshy place; and think because it does not penetrate deeply.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for the area until it heals completely.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 But if the place is sealed and separated from its materials, and remains for a long time: then you know that it has been healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And if they do not separate it from him of the matter, then you know that it is pervasive, or its bone within is rotten, or somewhat like those: whose memory will come to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 In this manner, cauterizing kidneeby Albucasis.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 39 by Albucasis.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When this happens in the kidneys: pain from cold or from heavy winds, and it diminishes due to that sickly coat, then one must cauterize it above the almethen with a caustic over these kidneys, with a caustic clavil on every kidney, its memory precedes.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we shall again cauterize it within the same plaster.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Why three straight lines come. (The instruction seems to relate to a pattern or technique used by Albucasis
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, they will be more lasting in healing. (This appears to describe the effect of cauterization as described by Albucasis
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 In this manner, cauterizing the bladder by Albucasis. (The instruction is for translating a phrase regarding the technique used for tre
Caput XL.	 Chapter Ⅺ by Albucasis. (Al
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When there is weakness in the bladder and mollification by cold as well as humidity until it no longer retains a sickly urine, then you must cauterize it on the lower part of the bladder, where the hairs of the comb begin, with a caustic from the right side and another from the left; and let the length of this caustic be according to the number of fingernail ridges: and cauterize that same thing with a caustic on the backside or two caustics if you desire it so, and let its memory precede as much as the clavil. (This is an intricate translation from Albucasis's medical treatise on surgical techniques for treating bladder weakness.)
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 In this manner, cauterizing the womb by Albucasis. (The instruction seems to relate to a procedure or technique from his works
Caput XLI.	 Chapter LXI by Albucasis. (Alb
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When cold and humidity occur during pregnancy and prevent impregnation, her menstruations are corrupted, the stimulation of them is delayed, and she experiences pain as they approach, then it must be that she is cauterized with three caustic agents around the navel, as we mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder, and on a hot iron placed lower on her back, or by two caustic agents; let the caustic agent be sharp.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 Of treating Anka with cauterization for displacement.
Caput XLII.	 Head XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When secretions from the mucous membranes of Anka's bladder occur and cause her demise by displacement from its place; the sign of this is that one leg is raised when they are brought close to each other; it has been found that the location of dislocation is in an empty space.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore, the infirmity must be cauterized with a caustic agent on Anka's bladder using a similar circular pattern; after you mark with hot wax around the circumference of the bladastery, as it rolls back: and let her bladastery fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 Let the shape of the caustic agent that preceded be used in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If you do not have this caustic agent at hand, then cauterize it with three caustic agents using a large cooking oil iron; and let the depth of the caustic agent be made according to the thickness of the skin of the whole area.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 Of treating sciatica with cauterization.
Caput XLIII.	 Head XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in Anka's bladder and the cause of it is coldness and humidity; and you treat her illness as we mentioned in division, and it does not strengthen treatment: then it must be that you dissolve her infirmity with thick fluids from foul pills or artificial pills, and like things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then burn it with a cautery.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of cauterization for this is in two ways: either with a cautery containing medicines or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 A cautery with fire, there are many methods to it.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One is used to burn upon the skin lesion using three triangular cauteries in this manner.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make it a deep or shallow burn.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And the space that is between all casteries in size and thickness should be an almond-sized one, and the cautery should be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 At times, however, a cautery is placed directly over the center of the lesion itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four types of cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 And if you wish to burn with a circle, which precedes the form used in the cauterization of joint lesions by one: that it is a circle containing the entire joint.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And char the full thickness of the skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is a method of caterization for sciatica when the pain clings to the joint itself and does not spread up to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 But if it spreads to the hip and leg, then burn it with two cauteries over the hip, over the place where the patient leans, in which there is pain, and with your cautery olive-shaped on the shin four finger widths apart: and let the cautery be almond-shaped.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And the depth of the burn should match the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the patient leans that the pain extends near the toes, then burn it there with a point cautery, three, or four, or more points as needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 And if the patient leans that the pain is under the knee to the leg, then burn it there with a single almond-shaped cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And let your caustic be in all of your cauterization so that you do not burn out with the cautery to such an extent as to scorch the nerves or a large artery, and draw it through upon the patient causing harmful illness or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 And indeed I have seen one and another who cauterized above the wound, and they completed in cauterization, and the leg swelled, until the tumor adhered to the foot, and it was perforated entirely, and became corrupt: then occurred discharge of pus, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And some wise ones have said about cauterizing an abscess, which is the method of this cautery.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a similar pincers of iron, whose diameter is half a palm; and let it be at the opening according to the size of the nailhead or less about that: and within the pincer let there be a third part [of the head].
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let there be space between all pincers according to the number of knots on the thumb: and let them [the pincers] be open from two sides: and let their height be as a knot, or two knots: and make for them handles from iron properly fitted into the pincers.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it must be heated in fire until red-hot, and throw off sparks; then placed over the box of an abscess with a sick person lying on his side on a healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Therefore, cauterize it with three round cauteries at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then remove it after three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Then apply plasters with butter: and leave an open wound for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with ointment until healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 "Albucasis says that we have scarcely used this kind of cautery on a child, because of the fearful appearance it causes; and for this reason, as few are found who dare to apply themselves above it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 "However, that is a good kind of cautery among those who endure it, and he finds its proper place with him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 "However, the cautery is with those who come for medicine, as you make two samite sleeves pierced by rings into which descends the card of its gate made from brass or iron; whose in height are two knots, or almost so.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 "And let there be space equal to the quantity of thickness of a finger between both sizes; and they are open below and above: and that contain themselves by inch within this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 "Then place it over an anchor-shaped lead, lying on its side upon the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 "And press your hand much over the anchor-shaped lead.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 "Then pour between two circles of hot water that is heated with fire scarcely enough, and hold it for the amount of time of an hour; let the infirm suffer its biting, and its burning itself because he found this biting like a fire until the biting rests.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 "Then oint your hand with an instrument and remove the hot water from the anchor completely using sweet water; then let it be for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 "And put butter on that until the burn's blackness disappears: and let it be for some days, and let pus come out from there.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 "For this is indeed the last of healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 "Then care for that with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 "But if the pain extends to the thigh or leg: make for him a vessel that contains water as you did with the anchor equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is a method for warm water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on medical corrections.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take alkaline and non-burnt lime of either part: grate both, and place them in a new vessel whose lower portion is pierced with a small hole, according to the amount that ingredients the radius: and place under the bottom of the vessel another glass vessel: and pour over the alkaline and lime from sweet water enough to submerge both by an inch: after which you compress it with your hand's good pressure: and remove the vessel when the liquid descends through the lower part of the glass vessel.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then add all that water, and pour it over another lime: and stir until dissolved.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For then it will be very strong in acidity, which is administercued in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Since its own operation is fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And from the medical substances with which they are causticated, like tissue, and meal of the bladder nuts, and lime mixed with soap, so that both are well mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And indeed, Galen himself recounted the story of a certain man from ancient healing, who was cured of the pain of the bladder and sciatic lymphs: and praised it greatly.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that it did not need another treatment, and that he was cured by one means only, until he declared, for perhaps he had entered a public bath and been relieved of it already cured.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is to be received from the green seeds: and if not found green, take dry, fresh ones: and treat much with some other fat, and place over the bladnter where there is pain or limb, either thighs or hips: and bind it, and remove after a quantity of three hours, or according to how much weakened feeling by heating one feels.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then insert him into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body is affected by moisture, place it on the stool.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For the pain subsides and heals.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that one should not use any caustic with such medicines unless after evacuating the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscoreto who said that goat dung, when used with it for causticizing the sciatic nerve, provides him: and a caustic is made according to this method.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Let wool be taken, and soaked in ancient oil, and placed over the deep place which is between the first joint of the foot, and the ham, and is nearer to the flame.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dried goat dung, and ignite it on fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place it over the wool, and press down so that it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	 Then repeat that (process).
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Therefore do not cease to make such an action until a feeling reaches the ankle, and pain rests.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of causticizing is called Vaca's caustic.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 About the causticizing of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 42.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Sometimes it happens that pain occurs in the back due to various causes, or from injury, or from excessive evacuation, and such like, from an injection of cold matter, and wet: and causticizing indeed does not apply, except in this species alone, which arises from an injection of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after evacuating the sick with fetid pills and such like, they should be made on the back where there is pain, three lines according to its breadth, after signs are marked by encaustic in every line five causticizations or more depending on the quantity that comes from the endurance of the patient's strength: and it shall be a causticization with cauteropunctures.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if it is a vein, cauterize with three or four cauteries using the middle spike of a caustic iron according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Regarding the manner of cauterizing in cases of scoliokyphosis.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This affliction often occurs in young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 And the sign of its onset is that it happens with a stricture during breathing and movement; you will find it present at the last thoracic vertebrae and its adjacent nodes, which now protrude above the remaining vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, when you see this and wish to treat it with a method that follows this design: use the caustic iron in a circular manner according to this method.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And the caustic iron should cover every part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to use it around the contour of the vertebra with a pointed iron having two or three lines, which are close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for the place until it heals as we have described.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And be careful not to administer the caustic iron on scoliosis that occurs due to nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 Regarding the method of cauterizing for gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 4^6.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When joint pains are due to cold humors that discharge into any part of the body, then when such pain occurs in the feet, it is a customary practice among physicians to properly call this Gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 Therefore, when treating the gout caused by cold with methods of healing and if the pains do not disappear, then a caustic iron removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is that you should cauterize this after evacuation around the joints of the feet with multiple caustic irons and that the iron be Olive oil-based.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is the form's nature.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you find spots on the foot, then make points with a caustic iron.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If pains ascend to the knees or other joints and this often happens, then cauterize them over all three joints with a caustic iron or four from every side using the same causteal iron as Clávius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 However, if you need more of this caustic iron, then use it for cauterization.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not immerse your hand with the caustic iron, only its thickness of skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 However, if pains also ascend to the knees and backs: then apply what we have mentioned from the caustic iron in that chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 That if pains are only on hands: then make points around the fire's edge, as two lines recede.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 However, if there are remaining painful digits: then make points on them, a point over the entire knot, and over the ridge of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 However, if pains rise for days to the heels or shoulders: then cauterize both from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not dispel a weak patient from good treatment by means of receiving medicine.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if it becomes good treatment and the phlegm is dispersed, he will be healed with God's help by this caustic iron.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 § On how to perform cauterization on ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When a rupture occurs on the groins and the intestines descend to the zirbum of the testicle, and this is about to happen imminently: then it must be advised that the sick person should stop their diet for that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And he should use mild substances so that feces descend from his bladder.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then he should sit between your hands on his back: and advise him to keep his breathing until it leaves or appears the zirbum or intestines.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then reduce it with your fingers and make marks with an encaustic over the rupture atop the nose bridge, where the tip is similar to half of a circle towards the upper body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then apply the iron cautery in this form until white appears and ejects small sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then reduce the intestine or its swelling to a hollow.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then he shall place his hand over the spot so that it does not protrude further: and now you have opened between the infirm's groin, and placed underneebelow litter, and another servant on his thighs holding hands, and another above his chest who holds.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then remove the iron cautery from the mark with your hand while standing straight with the cautery.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold it until you connect with him, or repeat with another while, if not connected to him up to the mouth yet.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine at the hour of your cautery, lest you burn him through it, and that no wound or great evil may occur over him.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not connect with the iron during the operation, your work is in vain.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 And it is necessary for the iron of children to be delicate, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then attend with the remaining ointments until healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 And it is necessary that you place his nourishment according to the length of time required for healing, which soothes his thirst: lest the intestine may protrude during effort and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then when he wants to rise after forty days, then provide a decent bandage, and hold it for another forty days with others.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And reduce his workload, and nourishment and drinks, and restorative words.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 Therefore, when one uses this method, they are completely healed.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I will say the treatment of ruptures with incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 But when ruptures occur in the remaining intestines and are beginning, and one avoids them adding up, then they cauterize that rupture with a round caustic according to its size: and what is burned should be done so as the third part of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then he cares for it in the way we said: and it does not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And now some first authors have said: to be burned with a triangular caustic according to this pattern.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After being marked by the caustic and a line is drawn that runs through its width on the upper side of the rupture, and another one below it.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand with the sealed caustic.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first caustic is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 In this way of cauterizing for pains due to a cause or percussion.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLV though. (Note: This appears to be an instruction rather
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When pain occurs on certain limbs due to a cause or blow and the pain persists for a long time without providing relief with medicines: then it should be burned with the pointed caustic.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And the caustic for all limbs should be a caustsic according to its size, weakness, frailty, strength, position of twisting, and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If therefore one is healed by the first caustic, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then apply a repeated caustic on the above.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 For it is usual for these pains to transfer from one limb to another close to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore it should be followed up with caustic until the weakened one heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 "Concerning the method of cauterization in leprosangs.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 "Leprous sores, however, are best treated with cauterization during the healing phase.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 "And especially leprous diseases caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when considering to cauterize such.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 "If therefore leprosy is unmanageable and has been treated as we discussed in the division, but does not descend nor remain still: when treating such a patient with extensive corruption affecting their entire complexion—then cauterize them on top of five points using hot irons; one atop the known midpoint of the head, another below it toward the forehead where the hairline ends, two above both ears, and one behind the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 "And your last hand with the hot iron lightly until it leaves a slight imprint; and remove any exposed cores from there: to alleviate heavy breathing of foul humors arising from that spot, also cauterize on top of the spleen with another hot iron as previously noted.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 "However if the leprosy has spread over the patient and is clearly visible: then one must proceed to cauterize with those hot irons as we mentioned on top of the head, and a hot iron over the tip of the nose, two on each cheekbone, two between the neck vertebrae, six between dorsal spines, one large on either side near the base of the tail, and another straight ahead: also with two over hips, that is one across each hip and two over knees. One on top of every single kneecap and two per leg, two above elb^
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 And cut your nerves that are above the last heel, so as not to burn them up.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And at times he will cauterize with a caustic on the bone of the ribs and another on the bbeanbone, and another elsewhere.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And know that as much as you add caustic, there is more suffering, and it becomes stronger.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And know that the sick man does not find pain in caustic as a healthy one would: for this reason, because his body is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 And it should be that the caustics are of appropriate size and intensity according to the limbs and joints: as prescribed by the types of tools used.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the caustic with grass meal mixed with honey, and the rest of treatment until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 ¶ On how to cauterize a stupor. (Note: This is not an instruction from Albucasis but added as part of the medieval
Caput L.	 Head A. (This could be a reference to
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a limb falls asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then one should cauterize the numbed limb with caustics, according to its size or intensity of the member.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 And let your caustic be placed just below the thickness of the skin. (This could also refer to an aspect of cauterization technique, though not from Albucasis's text but rather a general medical
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until healed. (Note: This instruction is about post-cauterization care and does not come directly from Alb
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 And at times he will casterize against a numbing (stupor) that occurs to the hand or foot, on the vertebrae near the nerve exits that move that limb: and it removes the numbness. (Note: The instruction is for treating specific cases of numbness with cauterization techniques.)
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But do not assume this without the one who is wise in the anatomy of limbs and the exiting nerves that move the body: (Note: The comment stresses the need for medical expertise before attempting cauterization.)
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 Of the method of cauterization in the armpit.
Caput LI.	 Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When the armpit becomes old and no longer benefits from medical inventions: then cauterize over it with a slightly deep caustic according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and the color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with herb meal and linseed with rose oil, and with leaves of arnoglossum, and dove's blood, and hyrcynus's blood: each is one part: these things are mixed together, applied to cloth, adhere to the place, until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 Of the method of caturization in the cancer.
Caput LII.	 Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When the cancer is starting and there is a fever of the flesh: then cauterize it with a circular caustic around its circumference as it heals over.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 However, wise ones have said that it should be cauterized with the last (or deepest) caustic at the center.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 But it does not seem reasonable to me: because I fear that it would ulcerate: and I have already seen this thing happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 And more correctly is it to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said before: or with many caustics.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 Of the method of caturization in the adubated wounds.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When anyone has adubated wounds that are delayed in healing due to being over-dressed or the weakness of old age when they have few drops of blood, or because it is time and the flesh hastens the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around its circumference with several small caustics by pricking.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then remove them.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For they will hasten the healing process themselves.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 However, if one wishes to perform a puncture through it with a cautery, then this is the form of fire used for that purpose.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And place it on the middle of an adobe, until it pierces the skin; and let the cautery be weakened as follows to allow a clean flow.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it so that it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Thus, regarding the method of cauterization on the bad ulcer.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 A corrosive is not except a decay within the walking limb, and it consumes it: as fire eats dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If then you see a corrosive where it can withstand the cautery with fire, then many fires of small and large sized pincers should be used according to what is suitable for that place where the ulceration is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it from every side until you remove the entire decay, and nothing should remain permanently from it.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then release it for three days and place over the sites of cautery ground sulfur with oil, until all scabs are removed, and all decay is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then take care of it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If however you see that after three days a healthy skin is born where there is no decay, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery over what remains from the sites of decay.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 And a corrosion is treated sometimes with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 For it arises at the site of castery itself.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 But indeed the fire of a castery is more quickly healing: and I have already mentioned that this cautery with sharp medicine should be taken in division; so take it whenever you find them to be needed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Thus the method of cauterization on boils, and warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 Many times this illness has occurred in the lower parts of the feet: it is a thick, filtered condition that afflicts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 And indeed there are two methods of applying heat to these: one with fire and another with warm water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for the method with fire, it is like a sharpened quill of an eagle's feather made from iron: this should be crafted according to the amount of lines on all sides; and have delicate edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the heated one over the wound.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then move the hand holding the cautery around the wound until it reaches to the depth of the w groove; and release it for three days, until pus begins to flow out.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply a poultice with fine flour mixed with salt on it; and leave the poultaster overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 For indeed, it will be removed from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the place with a regenerating ointment on the flesh; until healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they are not converted and occur frequently on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet; then apply heat with warm water to them: it is like receiving a tube made from copper, iron, or an eagle's quill feather; and place it over the wound or ulcer.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a small quantity of warm water into the tube; hold your hand and gently move it with slight pressure from your own hand, so that the edge of the tube is pressed in at the base of the wound, and finds a way for the warm water to reach deep inside toward the root of the ulcer: and let the patient wait briefly above the application of warm water once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then release it, for indeed the wound is removed from its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Do this with each one after another, until you reach all who are among them in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then care for them after they are removed, as with what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 In the manner of cauterizing in trembling.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When a tremor occurs from cold in the nerve or from quartan fever or another: then it must be cauterized with four cauteries, or five over the dorsal vertebrae, and all along each vertebra with a cautery, and on its chest with a cautery, and over its stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The tremor rests when it is an oil cautery, and the health hastens away from the disease of coldness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 In the manner of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 At times are ejected from the body of Albathir foul, that is, pustules which form from rotten thick materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, it must first appear when they are visible and should be cauterized with a fine cautery over the entire head of the pustule with wood of myrtle, whose tip is lit on fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of the long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lentil-shaped castery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized with an emollient according to this method at the beginning of their expulsion: and they do not increase; and it breaks down the excess making them, and heals from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, it must be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 In the manner of cauterizing from a blood flow out of an artery into a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Many times there is a blood flow from an artery that has been cut near a wound, which happens externally, or at the site of a cut on swellings, or by a cautery on limbs, and others like it: and it becomes difficult to tear away from them.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly with your hand go to the arterial opening, and place it over your index finger: and press it firmly, until blood is pressed under your fingertnail, and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place a small piece of caudia oil on fire, and many more; and blow over it until they are very well lit.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one or several or a large piece from them, according to the wound and place where the artery is severed, and apply the caudia to the vessel itself; then quickly move your finger: and hold the cauterium until blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If blood is expelled with your finger from the arterial opening, and you put out the caudia, then quickly take another piece of caudia that has been prepared on fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 So do not cease to do this after one with another, until blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And be careful not to burn the nerves that are there, and let harm come from other diseases upon the weakened person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to cut off the flow: especially if the artery is large, unless with one of four kinds [of caudia].
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a caudia, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with an excision, when it is not excised.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is extracted, the limbs contract, and blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or tied with a strong thread [ligature].
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or placed over the proper medicine to cut off blood, and pressed with a suitable tight bandage.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 Whoever performs the excision with a bandage and tightened cloth, or places burning materials and similar things upon it does not fully benefit him except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 However, if this happens to someone and there is no doctor present or medicine available: then one should begin with the positioning of the index finger over the wound itself, as we have described, and with a tight grip, until blood is squeezed out from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And the finger must not be removed; it should always stay with cold water of strong chill until the blood congeals, thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile, he must consider what needs to be applied from a caustic or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 On Cutting, Puncturing, and Phlebotomy on Wounds, and Similar Things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 Now we have said in Chapter One, every disease that requires the use of a burning caustic and corrosive medicine, its cases, causes, instruments, and forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And I placed here chapters from head to foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And now, I will proceed in this chapter along the same path: that it may be relieved of what is sought for it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, you must add to your son what is found in this chapter from the terror that exists in Chapter One on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And because of this, it is necessary to be very careful with that, as during the operation found in this chapter, there are often bouts of vomiting with blood, which accompanies life at a wound opening or incision over an abscess, or at the extraction of a splinter, or healing of a wander, or removal of an arrowhead, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all these come trembling, fear, and death occurs in many cases.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I advise you not to fall into that where there is hesitation, for sometimes people with such ailments are prone to this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For there is one who is provoked by his own affliction, and he has a slight death within him; because of his severity which he found from his illness and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when it is an affliction due to fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And there are those who give their flute players and boast with them, hoping for health, but their affliction is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore it does not pertain that you should agree to those who come to you from them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 And let your caution be greater than your desire and your greediness.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume about something from that unless after certain knowledge, which verifies among you what has come to a praiseworthy succession.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And make use of all the sick among you in diagnosis and prescription for that which is fittingly health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For indeed it is with you an aid to the attainment of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 God inspires you, O children, with understanding, and may He not take away from you guidance and inspiration: for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And indeed I have ordered this Chapter by distinguishing through chapters, according to what preceded in the Chapter of Cauterization from hair to feet: that it may relieve you of what you sought out from it and wherein you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 ¶ On the healing of water which is gathered in the heads of boys.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this affliceing often happens among boys around the time of birth: or when an obstreperous midwife strangles a baby's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And whenever this happens for some unknown cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And indeed, I have not seen this affliction in others except in boys; and to everyone whom I saw affected by it, death has come: therefore, for that reason, I considered abandoning the treatment of it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And indeed, I have seen this boy whose head was filled with water and his head was magnificent every day until he could not sit up on himself due to its size; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And indeed, this moisture is either added between the skin and the bone or accumulated under the jawbone.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation on this, if there is moisture between the skin and bone and there is a swelling of the pharynx, then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure one width wide: and the length of the fissure should be like two nodes, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of strangulation.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 But if the moisture has increased even more, and there is a larger swelling, then place two such incisions according to this shape.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is underneode the bone and its sign is what you see the commissures of the head open from every side; and water is pressed when you compress it with your hand inside: and that is not hidden from you, then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head with three fissures according to this model.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after the incision, extract all moisture completely.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then close the incisions with bandages and swabs.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 And then remove that [the abscess] from above with wine and oil up to the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then dissolve the bandage, and treat the wound with dressings, and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not abandon compressing the head equally.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 And feed the sick person with dry food and a little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 And another method of incision is to consider where the size of swelling appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 For sometimes it is more on the back of the neck, or at the shoulder, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore ascend with incision where you see swelling and water collection, and cut that as is possible to you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe that you do not cut the artery, and blood flow occurs, and the sick person dies from this flow with evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 § Concerning incision of Arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When a person has catarrh to the eyes or chest and it persists, and does not yield to medical treatment: then the final treatment is greater in that incision of those two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when one wishes to make an incision, it must relieve a sick person's head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then the hairy place with rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let a sick person bind his neck with each of its own cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then consider where the blood flows.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And places of both are places that lie behind down ears: and they are rarely concealed, except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then signs with wax on each side: and cut both at once from the edge to a little mouth, upon incision reaching the mouth: so that it be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you wish, insert the small mouth beneath the artery and cut them together with incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 And be the length of incision as two fingers joined.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when blood is cut, it goes out with pulsing flow, which jumps to the internal organs frequently.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 However, if the artery is not palpable by feel, one must take measurements from the ear to determine the space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with hot wax and measure up to the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And what needs to be drawn out from the blood is six ounnces or perhaps more or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 The whole of it should be done according to the quantity that appears to you from the sickness and fullness of the patient's artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 Then if there is still something protruding from the wound to the mouth, then incise it so that a hot swelling does not occur; then bind the wound with linen threads.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 § Regarding the extraction of arteries that are located at the temples.
Caput III.	 Head III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old hemicrany occurs to the man or acute catarrh because of acid moisture and heat in the temple muscles or a long-standing headache and such like: and it is treated with the methods of curing by medicine, and does not cure it completely; then we have become skilled in treating these diseases through the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their burning as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method of operation for extracting them is that the sick person removes hairs on the temples and attends to an apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 For it shows itself to you by its own pulse, and rarely hides except in a few people or from intense coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 But if it is hidden to you, then the sick person binds his own head with any of his cloths: and afterwards a warm place with coarse cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or a warty place with hot water, until it is clearly revealed to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the padded garment, which I had formed earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then remove the skin with it until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then insert a hook into it, and extract it from above until you remove it completely from the skin, and make it exit out of the tunics that are underne cujusque partibus.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If however the artery is thin: then wrap it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then incise from that side according to how much its ends are extended, and contract them so that the blood does not flow out.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not incised, and if it is not severed, the blood will not rise up completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then evacuate six ounces of blood until .3 [liters].
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 But if the artery is large: then it should be tied off in two places with a string of double thickness and strength made from silk or horsehair, so that putrefaction does not approach to itself before consolidation of the wound, and blood flows out.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then incise the excess that is between the two ties.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you can, burn it with a brand up to the bone using a surgeon's knife: until its ends are cut off and it stands in place of that operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And this is better done if he does not have a fever or overheated constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 For the branding iron is from those things which help to finish off moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it helps better.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the removal of arteries, as it should be filled with old-fashioned cooking mortar: and pills are placed over them properly made.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the wound is cleaned with dry medicines that make flesh grow, and with lime, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If during the operation there is a flow of blood from an artery, then quickly proceed to cut it off with a cautery or fill the space with wax as you complete your task, and hold your hand tightly until the blood stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If nothing is currently available to you, then place something on your finger until the blood hardens.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And cleanse the area with vigorously cold water until it cools down and is tightened as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And what is lighter and easier to extract the artery, you have this with a cautery that has two knives on it; so keep both blades of the knife similar in sharpness to an Almahadite (a type of hard steel).
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However, their sharpness is much less than that of two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Since if they are sharp like two knives, heat both ends: and do not cut the flesh quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Since there is some thickness in them, they must be heated with fire, and the flesh cut quickly: so this tool is better for every work, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And let the space that is between the two knife sizes be equivalent to a finger's thickness, after you mark two places with encaustic (wax): and lay both ignited ones very carefully, until they reach the mouth, and cut into the wax at these two places: so it will elongate what lies between those ends.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 For with this cautery they do not become thoroughly hardened.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the form of a caterie. (Note: The term "cauterie" here
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 Regarding the treatment for persistent tears flowing from the eyes. (Translation note: "assiduarum" is likely a mistranscription or copyist error, possibly meaning "excessive" or related to persistence)
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV. (Note: This would typically be part of
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When there are persistent tears and the course of these from veins that lie outside the skull on top of the head: and nothing is congested with it regarding treatment medicines along with other medical remedies, and he sees his face already reddening, and feels movement in his forehead as if it were ant trail movements by ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist to such a degree that the hairs on them have been corroded by corrosion: and his eyelids have become heated from the persistence of tears: then ancient physicians resorted in the treatment of these through this operation, and they named it as a cure with Ense (a type of surgical instrument).
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And indeed, you should instruct a sick person to pluck his hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three incisions on his forehead at equal distances along its length: so that the length of each incision is about two fingers, one being equidistant from the middle of the nose along the front; the second according to the length by a little more than the reach of your arms; and the third to the other side. And from the incisions cut out the arteries which are on both sides: elongate your hand along the continuation of the two jaws, so that the space of the incision is equal to the length of three fingers joined together: and have for you a truncated sponge or many dried pieces of cloth with which to absorb any excess blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert the spatula at the two sharp ends, whose following form is as follows:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the incision that is on the side of the temple, to the second incision: and scrape with it completely all skin between the two inciscu, covered by fatty tissue, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do also that from the middle incision to the second incision: (Continue with additional steps or procedures as per original text instructions).
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove the spatula and introduce another instrument again into the first incision, which is called a sharp cutting tool with one blunt edge, not sharp on the other side: (Proceed to detail how this instrument will be used according to the original surgical procedure).
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form. (This could imply that detailed instructions or diagrams follow this
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place the sharp side of its blade against the attached flesh with fatty tissue, and the blunt side against the bone; and press it until it reaches the middle fissure: and separate everything along with it that runs down from the head to the eyes, except for the continuing incision in the skin. (This instruction is part of a larger surgical procedure where precise actions must be taken when handling tissue during an operation.)
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then perform this on the median cleft up to another cleft.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And after it has run an equal amount of blood, express the places from pieces of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place liniment made from old cooked wax into every cleft, and apply soaked breadcrumbs over them with wine, oil or vinegeroom.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And make sure that hot inflammation does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day dissolve the bandage and apply a large quantity of infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it with basil oil, and other remedies used to heal wounds: until healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 ¶ Regarding the treatment of sharp tears and rheums for eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	 Head V. (Note: This is presumably
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When sharp tears and rheums occur frequently, severely: and one sees his eyes being exhausted, diminished, and their aspect is already weakened: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls from them, and there is acute pain in deep head: then take these conditions into account, that those materials, and tears do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 And the better treatment for them is this one.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it is as follows: instruct to rub the forehead of the sick person.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one cut into the cleft in the middle of the forehead or slightly across its width, and begin from the left temple to the right temples: and let the incision be up to the mouth: and stretch your hand along the incision from the temples that move during chewing: until it is revealed: and dry all blood with a sponpress.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate between two lips of the cleft with old cooked wax or with linseed oil.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then bind it tightly from above with soaked breadcrumbs: and moisten the breadcrumbs with wine and oil to prevent hot inflammation.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you loosen it and see that the swelling becomes hotter: then one must scrape the bone until flesh begins to grow there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then care for it with the treatment of excision that makes flesh grow: as if you received two parts from flour and four parts from colophony: and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the wounds at birth of the flesh.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 Concerning its treatment that applies to gold.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that applies to gold is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, like iron and glass; or plant-like, such as beans and chickpeas; or something fluid, like water and vinegerockets, and their equivalents in the field) - or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 Whenever it applies to gold and is not the kind of mineral added nor grows into the gold, expose the gold to the sun: if you then see a stone, distill something from olives or saffron onto the gold.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer its extraction, and induce sneezing with the conditioner, and fill up the nostrils at the onset of sneezing when you place fragments from cloth or wool around the ears and stretch the gold to the top.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 For often it is expelled with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 But if not released, then administer its extraction with the gills (that is, with fine sieves): this shape is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If it is expelled with the gills, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer its extractions with a fine hook in several duplicate iterations.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 But if it still does not come out with that, then make a tube of metal and insert the tip of the tube into the ear canal greatly, and fill what is around the tube with wax diluted with oil, so that only through the tube there be no wind: then extract it with your strong attractive power.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 Many times indeed it comes out with what we have told.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If however it does not come out this way: then take some helkalimbat or viscous substance, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the end of the bone after you have made an incision carefully placed in order around: then insert it into the ear hole when you have dried up the ear.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If however it does not come out with everything that we have told: then quickly proceed to cutting before a hot suppuration or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 And the method of making a hole is, as phlebotomists first to an ill person's head: and extract from him blood according to his strength measure.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the ill person sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards upwards, and find a small hole in the root of the ear near to his fat on the same place that is sunken: and let the hole be crescent shaped until you reach rock: then remove it with what is possible for you from instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then close the hole by your hand quickly and take care of it, until healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 That if what is falling into the ear comes from one grain which grows and swells: then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 If however it does not agree with you for an exit, then take a slender and delicate paste in this manner.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with it an incision of that kind from the grains which fall into the ear, and do not make this when you think that that granule is already moistened by sweat in the ear until you put many pieces: then remove them with a hook or a delicate grip or suction as we have mentioned, for the removal of that is lessened.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 However, the water that enters the ear should be used with a weak sternutation initially; and now it has filled its own ear with something quite cooked old; and he is lying on top of that ear where there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If however it comes out through this, then it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of your finger, light and weak, heat them with little fire, and let the sick person insert one into his ear hole; and he should jump on one foot from that side, and strike with a stone against another stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore, do not stop doing this with stone and stone until all water has come out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now the water has come out so that you may take from your fire or from one reed and insert its end into the ear; and ignite the other end with fire until it is mostly burnt.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another reabendothomirim; and do this many times until all the water has come out: and remove it with a tube as was previously mentioned in stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 In the removal of animals entering into it, if it is a creature of the body like a flea or similar, care for it as I have said in divisioning.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it is of a large body that appears to the sense: then apply its removal with tweezebacks and hooks; and the matter of this is easier for all those who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In the extraction of worms generated in the ear, when you care for it with that which I have mentioned in divisioning and dilation treatise, and your care is not enough: then one should look at the ear under the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If however something appears from these worms, then extract that with tweezebacks or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 However, if nothing appears there, then take the tube, which has this shape: tight at the bottom, wide at the top; and insert the delicate end into the ear according to the amount that the sick person can tolerate; then extract with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Repeat it many times until all worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 However, if they do not obey you to go out, then fill the area around the tube with wax as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 But if they do not go out as I said: then apply the distillations which the ancients have found effective against worms, and you will find that in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your pouring be as when you poured oil and remedies into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 Just as you see it made of silver or brass, narrow below, where there should be a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 So that the part which is inserted into the ear through the tube's hollowness is properly made of brass.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish to use the rod, take it and apply an oil coating on its end with a proper wool soak; then pour oil, or a poultice, or whatever medicine you have in the tangle into the tube; let that be in the ear: then insert the rod from above after it is heated gently; then squeeze out by your hand's moderate pressure until the oil is pushed downwards into the hollowness of the ear, and the patient feels something inside. And what you pour into the ear should already be somewhat warmed with a little fire: and do not let it have anything that has been distilled coldly poured in. For medicines cannot tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 On treating a case of worm-induced ear blockage.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 Sometimes certain infants come out from the mother's womb without having been pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And now it has happened to some men that there is swelling in the ear canal from an ulcer or flesh grown in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And sometimes this swelling occurs in the deep of the ear canal, which is not felt by touch; and sometimes it happens towards the outer part of the opening, and produces that sensation.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, what occurs deep within the ear, which is not grasped by touch, presents a difficulty in many cases of healing.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in that which produces the sensation, you must place the unwell ear near the sun and look at it; then if you see an apparent swelling, open it with a very delicate cloth of this kind, whose end has a small width, one part is sharp: and let the rest be doubled on both sides. So that it does not harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If the swelling is flesh grown in the ear canal: then hold it with a very fine hook and cut it off easily with a sharp razor until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If the swelling is deep within the ear: then take a very thin rod and make it warm with little fire; then put it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you also feel that swelling with the unwell person who has great hearing difficulty, try to open it easily; and be careful not to wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then put linen in the ear according to the width of the opening that you made in an ointment from Egypt; do this for several days until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen and pour it into rose-colored water; then powder with ground barley meal, and use that substance.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see the ear starting to become detached: then it is necessary to extract the linen, and let it rest with another linen that has been placed in vinegar which was made from rose oil; until the hot abscess settles down: then care for it as needed for healing.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If however there is bleeding: then immerse the sponge or cloths in cold water, and place a metal container over it; and continue with the remaining treatment that separates the predicted blood flow as described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 On the healing of eyelids.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 These eyelids that occur on the eyelids, sometimes are moist and sometimes are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hold them with tweezebrushes or hooks, and cut them off from the roots with a scalpel blade.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place something made of wax over the areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If however blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 Often they reappear when something remains from the roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when burned with fire, those roots are consumed and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 On the healing of glandular tumors on eyelids.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Often it happens that something occurs on the eyelids which resembles Crandini in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called Grandio; and it is an aggregation of thick moisture on the upper and lower eyelids.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore the operation on them is as follows: then you should consider if it is Grandio proceeding from there, what appears on the eyelid and moves to every part, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Then find a crack over it with width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 And then scrape it off from every part easily until it flees.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 And suspend it with a hook and separate that same thing.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 If however it is not prepared for separation by you unless after you enter the eyelid with a very slight incision, then that thing will harm the sick person in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If there is a large crack: then join it with stitches and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no great harm will come from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 For indeed the ointment restores it, and colors it flesh-colored.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 And if it is large and extends towards the inner part of the ear against the intrinsic surface, then turn to the eyelid, and detach the burr with a hook; besides which you will need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 That if it is prolonged on the eyelid by means of an incision, it does no harm to anything else.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then wash the eye after detaching the burr with salted water: and care for it as you would color the affected area, until it heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 § Regarding the treatment of axon injuries in the eyelids.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 Axon is fat that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid and indeed most often happens to children: it greatly affects their eyes, and they experience morning catarrh, and cannot see sunlight because tears flow towards them, causing them to lie down on their face always, sleeping over it, and their eyelids are moist under the brow bones, which have been thickened by swelling: indeed the prominence of Axon appears as an eye, and when you press with your fingers between those points, you feel Axon there.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method is that the patient should place their head in a position within yours.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take linen cloth and prepare salt water within it, and make a circle out of that salty water according to the amount which contains Axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place them on it, and press with your fingers from all sides so that Axirnath is accumulated in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in the middle of that moisture with a somewhat spread out patch cracks across its width, and it is not the main crack as occurs in deep venesection.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 It is necessary to find the skin in its entirety until you reach Axirnanthus, as Axirnath proceeds from a crack according to the shape of the flaky white frostbite.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 So extract it with the cloth you have placed between your fingers on the outside; and roll back your right and left hand until dispersed: and be careful not to put the cloth into the crack so that you do not come with a spread out patch towards the eye, and harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If however Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the crack, then put into the small crack with ease until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then extract it as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and press it with sponges.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And there are people who put salt on it, and place it in the depth of a crack so that what remains from that moisture can melt.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If however this occurs in a hot abscess, then treat the area with mild ointments until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 ¶ Concerning methods of Axirnath for the eye, that is when the eyelid is moistened by the eye, from which it swells as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Head XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs are born in the eyelids beyond their natural course under the skin of the hair: then they harm the eye and cause certain diseases such as constant tears, and swelling of the eyelids, and a white film until it leads to destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 Indeed, Atamishir treats eyes according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or by sharp medicine, as described in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Or Atamishir treats it with incision and stitching.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 Or by tubes, as I will explain.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 It is necessary to place the sick person's head in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then, gently lift the eyelid with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If thusly lifted, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if not: insert a needle into it where there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid and make the needle penetrate with the thread above, so that it is near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where hair grows: and pull the thread towards the upper lid, and lift it with a rod.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find within the inner part of the eyelid where there are added hairs with a small space due to tears from greater to lesser tear duct:
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a piece of cotton or cloth: then mark above the eyelid with wax incense, which is as the shape of the leaves of myrtle.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it must be done according to the amount and elevation of the eyelid: for that has been diversified among humans for a long time.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 For it is from these ones who need to be cut according to the large amount of an eyelid, according to the quantity that softens from the eyelab:
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then find over the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the greater tear duct up to the lesser one, and let there be a slit near natural hairs as is the thickness of a rod:
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert an awl into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then remove the skin entirely.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then gather the edges with two stitches using a needle and fine thread; clean up the blood, so that it clings to the threads above the two lacerations, applying some substances as needed if you wish to do so: and if not, do not worry about it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then remove the stitches and keep them for three or four days; afterwards treat that area.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish to, leave a wound without stitches and take care of it with something that dries up and contracts it.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid is injured near a scar, but will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of healing was taught by the ancient Atamirs. (Note: "Ataxmir" seems to be a misspelling or variation of "Al
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is concern for the sick person, and it comes from good surgery, and there is no fear involved. (Note: The sentence structure appears to be a bit disjointed due to the translation process.)
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method is also found with the Atamirs: and it consists of signs above the eyelid resembling the shape of a holly leaf, as we have described. (Note: The Latin text provided in this sentence seems to be a bit challenging due to possible translation nuances or transcription errors.)
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then the eyelid is cut with three separated or joined hooks according to this shape that follows, and then make an incision where there is excess with scissors of equal size. (Note: The translation reflects the direct instructions as found in ancient surgical texts; however, translating terms like "uncini" could be challenging due to its potential meaning variations.)
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and they do not fit: then take scissors where there is thread, and insert them into the middle of the shape; also insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and another thread near the smaller one; and join the threads with your fingers equally. (Note: This instruction requires careful translation to maintain the meaning of each action described in ancient surgical practice.)
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then make your elbow equal to the level and attach skin above it as we described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then join the two lips of the wound with a suture, and care for them until they heal.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If indeed an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure: apply the boar fat to the abscess and similar afflictions using soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes it happens that even the eyelids are affected, with their hairs turning.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, one must use what we mentioned regarding the incision: but the suture is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 ¶ Regarding the treatment of gout with a pessary.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 And it is, as you turn the eyelid and split the inward fissure according to what was told.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then skilfully make two thin canes or pieces of fine wood: whose length be according to the width of the ee lid, and their breadth less than its span: and now you have made cuts at each end where you hold them from both sides.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then join each with delicacy to what protrudes above the eyelid of the eye, and secure both canes from both sides with a strong binding, and let it go for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For the skin will die, darken, and putrefy until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 But if it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 And when it has solidified, level the eyelid: and its hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the shape of two canes that you make according to this pattern, and measure their quantity by length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 ¶ Regarding the leveling of prickly hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Head XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation is performed by taking a fine needle and inserting a thread made of fine silk into it gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then gather his limbs, and tie off each end with a delicate knot: and the length of the threads should be one hand's breadth.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then connect another fine thread under it for a short distance, and tie off his limbs as needed.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then the patient places their head in your lap, and position them close to the sun as you declare the operation: for it is a delicate or minute procedure.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the needle with the thread attached into the root of the eyelid and make it quickly pierce the eyelid until you extract a natural hair above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then pull out the hair up to the thread attachment and insert that hair into the attached thread: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then pull with your hand along with that and let the hair exit with the thread from the eyelid alongside the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 But if the thread is dragged and does not let out the hair with it: pulls the thread downwards with the thread that you composed in it, until the thread exits through the upper hole, and watches it by eye sight: then indeed you pull on the thread and the attached filament; and extract both, and close the eye; and leave it shut for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and grows over onto the body.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 But if the hair is short, then join it to a longer hair from natural hairs and let them grow out together; or leave it alone for some time until it grows out, and then extract it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 § Regarding the treatment of Albucasis that occurs on the upper eveeelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this happens to the eye, it is called "Leporine.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this sickness belongs to either natural causes or accidental ones.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Therefore, the accidental one arises from wound healing, cutting, cauterization, and similar methods.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 And the method of operation for this is as follows: you should find the wound's consolidation, separate its edges, and place something like a lint between them until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 And it is not necessary to use therein things that cause bleeding and constriction; for if you do so, the disease will return worse than before. Rather, use those which soften, such as foenumgraecum: boiled henbane seeds with water, in which althea has been cookeby barley meal ointment mixed with some oil: and rubbing on that bandage, and caring for it accordingly.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 And your treasury of healing is to discuss all methods, so that it does not solidify again, according to the initial shape.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 Indeed, this operation we have discussed is only a correction of the disease to prevent it from returning to its original shape entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 § On treating the disease that affects the lower eyelid, which is a wrinkling or lifting up to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter 14.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This disease that occurs below is called true Alxatratus.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 And it is natural and also accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the accidental one arises from a wound, a crack, or cauterization, and similar methods.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 And the method of operation for this is as follows: you should take two threads and dye them, then insert them into the flesh and make them penetrate from the left tear to the right tear until the thread reaches both ends of the skin.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then extend the flesh upward with a needle and incise it with a wide scalpel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If so, let it return to its shape as an eyelid according to what is proper.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take a rod and place it in the fissure, and turn with it the eyelid; then find two fractures on the inner side of the eyelardetermine that they are the extremities of the fissures from both corners of the incision until they converge to form an angle: when they have assembled this figure is formed, and it is a Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove the flesh by the amount that is the sharp edge below, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then join the separated parts with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them as we said, with soothing remedebut also wine and honey, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 And if Albucasis should occur from the fissure or suture, or by cautery: then it is necessary that you make the fissure flat under eyelashes, even as previously occurred.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between two lips with wine, as we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 And the utmost of care for Albucasis, whether it is above or below, ensure that it runs in this operation, according to how it was prepared as an Albucasis form.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 For this is of many diversities in the shape: and the prudent artist prepares the ingenuity with whatever possible to him, so that it may return to the natural form or almost to it, and also the sick person himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in various arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 Of the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 At times this hardening occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid is fused with the conjunctiva of the eye, and it prevents them from their natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, you must insert the tip of the stick under the eyelid and elevate it or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a very fine spatula so that it is not as sharp as the edge of the spatwallet but slightly blunt: so that the weak one may not be disturbed during surgery, and remove the sticky substance, and injure the eye with its own sharpness: and your incision should be as if you were to scrape away this adhesion easily until the eyelid returns to its natural form and the entire adherence heals.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then find water with salt at the eye and cleanse it with water: or drain into it from a sieve made of melted wax and water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with linen thread: and place soaked wool over the conjunctiva of the eye: and after three days use melted wax, and with it until healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 About the incision of the nail and projection of tear meat.
Caput XVI.	 Head XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail is in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Or it is nervous: and is similar to tough wax, fine.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen moisture whitewash: which when touched with a hammer or hooked with an awl, separates and does not stick in the hook.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And both kinds do not begin, unless from the main tear, until it gradually flows, and covers the eye, and stops its movement.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation for this incision is: that you place your sick head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open his eyes and gently lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then cleanse a hoof using a two-pronged caliper, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take a thorn and insert a hair from the mane of a horse or goat or wolf: and ensure that the thread is strong, with its end slightly doubled; and fix it in the middle of the hoof: then penetrate it with a needle, and tie the hoof using the thread, extending it upwards: and scrape off any hair on the side of the hoof following the pupil, as if you were trimming it with your fingers to its outermost edge.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remaining part at the tear duct with a sharp pincers or small scissors; and remove the natural tissue of the tear duct so that its incision does not cause an unceasing flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And at times it is extended with a single caliper or with a thread as we have mentioned. (However, note that this instruction seems to be incomplete and might need context from the rest of the text for accurate translation.)
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then gently scrape using smooth pincers like this: form. (Again, note that without further context or a description of what 'form' refers to in the original text, this translation may
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And be careful that the pincers do not touch the outer layer of the cornea, lest it gets torn and perforates the pupil. (As with previous translations, this is context-dependent and might require additional information from the original text for full accuracy.)
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, produce some crushed salt or a paste made from saffron into the eye and remove it up to the other day. (This translation is based on the available text but may not be fully accurate without additional context.)
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of it as necessary until it heals. (The sentence appears to lack specifics about what 'it' refers to and might require more information from the text for an accurate translation.)
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the hoof is not nervous and you cannot insert a needle into it nor fix it with pincers, then this kind of hoof is often treated many times with remedies, and heals as described for hemorrhoids when divided. (This translation might require additional context to accurately determine what 'remedies' or 'as described for hemorrhoids' refers to.)
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If a bone falls upon it, then open the eyes of the sick person and take a bandage that is thin, mild, weak in sharpness according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And scrape the hoof from above with careful delicacy.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it becomes rarefied and fractured, then distill from your horn into the eye made of silphium or red myrrh, or ground salt: and moisten the eye until tomorrow.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat the procedure over the same operation, until the whole thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless there is something contrary to you in a hot eye boil: for then let go of it, and treat the eye boil until healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure over that with scraping, until healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 However, the prominence of the lacrimal flesh, if it causes harm in a large eye affliction, suspend with a hook and cut from that part of it: and do not finish the incision, so that the course of tears does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then fill the lacrimal sac with red myrrh or silphium made, until healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 § From cutting on the eyebrow, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Head XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 It is born sometimes in certain eyes of men, composed red flesh or placed above, until it covers the pupil, approaches, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelangs to the outside: and resembles a rose thorn bush.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the operation on it is also such that the sick person places his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open its eyes, and cleanse all that flesh with hooks suitable to it: and hold it with one forceps or tweezers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh first, until finished entirely by cutting.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And the cavity from the eye so as not to harm the body during the operation: and let your incision be such that you make in it, or with a spatula, which we have mentioned in the nail cutting section: or with forceps like those by which a surgeon is tied, according to the form that comes after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 Therefore, when your incision is completed and the entire cataract is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or pour into it red powder, and such things from corrosive medicines: and place over the eye outside a cuttlefish bone mixed with albugineous substance: to ensure protection from a hot boil.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If there remains some catarpert from the cataract and you are mastered by warm blood, and a hot boil comes up: then close your eye, and care for it with that which soothes the boil.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then apply again over it after the surgery until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And likewise do with added flesh that occurs in this kind of eye.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 But it is necessary that you do not insert your hand into any weakness of the entire eye by a natural or accidental way while operating with iron: and do not introduce your fingers into any part of these operations until you see, what that body can bear such an operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 ¶ On collecting surplus matter from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 The red bandages that are made over the eye prevent its natural movement and weaken the eye with days in length.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 It is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which there is a Sebel is strong and does not have any illness besides the Sebel itself: then gather that Sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And you should instruct those who are weak to place their head on your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then hang those bandages with one hook or two according to your wisdom: and the hook should be a fine double-headed one, according to this shape, or there are two hooks arranged in one body, according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then carefully clean with fine scissors those veins gently and remove the blood hour by hour until you see that the veins have been removed from the eye and resolved; and be careful not to injure the eye with sharp tips.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And let your operation be at noon in the presence of the sun, and be very firm in your procedure so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then strain green or red saffron into the eye so that its sharpness counteracts what remains inside of it.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 But if it is not possible for you to gather all of that in one hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye; and let it go off by days a few, until it settles: and ensure away from warm discharge; then repeat upon it according to the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the form of scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 § Here is the treatment of Arissat's protrusion towards the nose.
Caput XIX.	 Head XXIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The doctors name the Arissat's fistula, which you should treat with a caustic or an acute burning medicine according to what preceded its description.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 And if it does not heal, then there is no way with that; unless you cut above the original wound at birth and remove all moisture and pus until it becomes visible.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 And when the bone is revealed, and you see decay or blackness within it, then scrape out that with an instrument whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 And it is called Asper's head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Let it be made of iron wire, and let that head be round as a drill, which has been dotted with the dotting of a razor or a fine needle's dotting: and place it on top of where the bone is decayed.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then roll it back between your fingers and gently press with your hand until you know that the corruption has been scraped off; do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Next, restore the place with expelled drugs containing astringents.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If it becomes consolidated and flesh forms within it, and pus is discharged from there: if it remains for forty days without recurrence, inflammamoin, or any occurrence happening within it; then you know that it has been cured.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, then there is no power in it unless to reduce the fistula back to the nostril hole according to this pattern.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And so as to reveal the bone second with iron or sharp medicine; and once the bone is revealed, then take a probe according to this pattern, where the tip of the iron is triangular: and the wood thereof be pyramidal-shaped until you see such shape.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place that over the bone; and it should be close to the tear duct: and lengthen your hand slightly away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then roll your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and feels weakness there; by this which finds wind coming out of it when they hold their hand over their nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore then restore the place with expelled drugs containing astringents as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 But when flesh forms and the place hardens; then the material which had been discharged outwards returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter over the weakened area.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 § On reducing the prominence of the eye.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye protrudes with its entirety and there is no harm or decrease to sight; then you should resolve the weakened part: afterwards drain it by phlebotomy: then place ventoses on its neck without incision but with suction. (Note: The translation of this Latin text is in accordance with medical practices from historical texts, modern surgical procedures might differ.)
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then place the ointment made from acacia, aloe, olive oil, and tragacanth over the eye.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then bind a bandage above on top of the plaster with many threads.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the mode of threads is as follows: receive some soft, many linen strips and double each strip from them altogether into four; then make more from them: place one on top of the other according to the quantity required by the eye; then bind these with a strip of sturdy cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat the blisters with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the blisters and loosen the bandaged eye for a day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If however the bandage becomes soft again, then it should be tightened greatly; then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If however you see that the eye has gained its normal appearance again, this is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, threads, binding, and blisterebs until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 ¶ About cutting into the white membrane of the eye. (This appears to be a title or section heading in Latin)
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 21. (This appears to be a chapter
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When a rupture occurs in the white membrane of the eye, then it protrudes and proceeds outward from the eyelids like grains of sand, and this causes disfigurement resembling that of a human due to it; thus the operation on it is as I describe: and you should insert an awl into its root from the lower part upwards. (This sentence is part of a surgical procedure described by Albucasis for treating "dacryocystitis," which translates to "tear sac inflammation" or rupture.)
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another awl where there is a double thread from the nasolacrimal part, and make it penetrate; then remove the first awl according to its own arrangement. (Continuing the surgical procedure described by Albucasis.)
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then incise the place of the double thread, and tie it with a strip around that part of the eye membrane: then bind it tightly. (This is another step in Albucasis's surgical procedure.)
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove the cataract and place a wool soaked in oil over the eye; then release it so that the thread slips out with the moisture.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the eye along with whatever comforts it until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes the thread is drawn from all sides in a circle of cloth, until the eye gains great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then a fine probe is used to reach the depth of the eye, and moisture descends from the albugineal tissue, and the eye enters; then thread it immediately, until healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 Regarding the treatment by Alcmund. (Please note that "Alcomnati" is a typographical error for
Caput XXII.	 Chapter amo. (The phrase seems incomplete or incorrect;
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This ailment called Alcmund's is not but pus that has accumulated in the eye and resembles water flowing downward; it is not itself. (Please note that "Alcomnaturis" seems to be an incorrect term, possibly intended to reference 'Alcmund', which doesn't correspond with any well-known ailment or condition from historical texts related to Albucasis.)
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method of operation is thus: make the sick person sit on an arranged seat, or directly (on a couch).
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take his head with your own hands from two sides and move it so that you see the pus coming to the lower parts of your eyes. (Note: The context suggests this is a procedure for examining or treating an eye condition, possibly in relation to Alcmund's as referenced earlier.)
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then draw out [the pus], and let it not descend further; unblock the passageway: and observe as before if the patient sees things like he saw them; and if it does not continue to descend lower, know that it is water (moisture).
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 If however the pus does not proceed as we have mentioned, then make the sick person sit between your hands (to examine or treat them).
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a fine probe and insert it slightly above the skin layer at the very edge of the conjunction with the corneal tunic (cornea), until the pus exits.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when it is taken out, then strain the warm water into the eye in which you mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled rue and hamolet; then treat with the rest of the treatment until healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 Concerning the care for water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have now mentioned the types of water divided, and that which is relevant to explaining how to make it, then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then it is necessary that you make him sit between your hands squarely against the light and close to the sun; and bind his healthy eye firmly, then tighten him well: then with your right hand, palpate the eyelid of his eye in which there is water if the affected eye is left; or with your left hand if the affected eye is right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take with your right hand a piece of almond paste for his left eye; or with your left hand for the right eye.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the tip of the almond paste near the crown as close to the radius bone visible in that small lacrimal albedo; then push the almond paste with strength: and when you recoil your hand from it, until it penetrates into the eye's sclera; and feel that the almond paste has already reached an empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And the measure of the journey of the almond paste to deepen must be measured as the space that is from the pupil up to the end of the sclera; and it is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 For indeed you will see this in the very pupil of the vision of the eye because of the transparency of the tunic of the sclera.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place the almond paste up to where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it lower with one rod after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If the water is immediately poured out, then the weak person sees that over which he opens his eye immediately, and an almond-shaped image appears in his own eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then rest for a while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If the water is indeed poured out, then it should be removed again afterward, except for the removal of the almond-shaped image.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it is thus inserted and does not go up: then extract the almond with ease, and you gradually pull back your hand.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve a bit of clear salt in water: and wash out the eye from above with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place a full pad or soaked wool in oil of rose on the eye, and create an almond-like appearance over it: and bind the healthy eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 But us and those who are of our time, we place a finely ground powder on top of the almond-like appearance with albumin.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 Which if the almond-shaped image does not conform to your eye entrance due to its hardness, since it is from a person whose eye is very hard: then you ought to take the Spatil asphodel, which is called by this name, which has this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore bind with the very thing you mentioned and do not finish your hand at the opening: and it is only to make a delicate way to the almond-shaped location.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then insert the almond-shaped image as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And at the end of your operation preparation, ensure that the weak person has a properly made sleeping place in which they can sleep on their back in a dark room: and prohibit all movements, and coughing: and put food for it there that is soothing to its nature: and do not move its head neither right nor left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the band be according to his arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then dissolve that in the dark room and try its vision; and make it see things clearly.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not necessary to do this at the time of treatment or immediately after making an incision; rather, it should be done by others: because water rises quickly through a violent appearance.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 But if a hot abscess occurs: then it should be dissolved before the seventh day; and correct that with what soothes the abscess until it is soothed: then release its vision, and place it over the face of its mouth for controlling sight under those days several, existing in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then he should gradually leave the house, and adapt to his own cases.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that in zinc there is no student excused from vision several times: then he may dare over the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And indeed it has come to us that some of those who are from Alairac said, that it was done in Alairac a punctured wall through which water is channeled.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 However, therefore I have not seen anyone on your land who did that: nor found it in any ancient books; and it is possible, that it may be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 And these are forms of species from Alairac, standing over those who ignore them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Let them be made of metal properly: and let their ends have the same subtlety triangle-shaped, and pointed tip.
Formae magda.	 Shapes of Acuña.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 ¶ On curing meat from nose. (Note that 'Magdalen' might be a typo for 'Acuñan,'
Caput XXIIII.	 Head 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 At times meat is born in the nose of different kinds added, some of which resemble a scorpion with many feet: and among them there is a fleshly cancerous, stony-like: and among them there is one that has mild flesh, not darkish colored. (Note: This sentence appears to be a mixture of medical observations from the period concerning various conditions related to nasal growths or tumors.)
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore, from those meats that are mild and not deceptive or cancerous, you should make them sit weakly between your hands opposed to the sole, open their nostrils, and project a hook into these meats: then pull them towards the exterior, and cut off what you have enclosed with it using a sharp pointed tool from one side until you know that the meat has been completely removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If anything remained from which the removal is not possible: then scrape that off with a single subtle instrument easily until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If however blood prevails over you, or if a hot abscess occurs: then oppose it with what is necessary: or if it is from malign boils, then quickly cauterize it, until the blood is shed and all meats are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then pour vinegar or water, or wine into the nostrangs after making an incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 However if the nose is opened and moisture proceeds to the palate, then you know that it is now healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 However if moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that there is meat generated within the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not arrive with an incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then indeed it is necessary that you insert a thread with some thickness, and knot many on it: and place between every node an amount of finger or less: and make weak again, so as to send one end of the filament into the nose with a hand's width, or with whatever possible after he has made something similar like this azar: and draw out its odor until it reaches the nostrils, and goes out above his own mouth.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed they do something similar to this Aztami children in schools: and it is an easy thing for him who desires it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place two ends of the ivory on it, one end that protrudes above the nose and the other that remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then take a saw for cutting flesh with knots present in its blade.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do that until you know that the flesh is already with knots on the ivory.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then extract the ivory and place it inside the nose after anointing with bloodletting oil that you have drunk in an Egyptian ointlete: do this for three days or more, until the ointment hardens completely what remains from the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then place at the end of the matter a lead pipe inside the nose for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 However, if it needs a treatment that removes it, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For making head baths with which to distill oil and other remedies into the nose, do this from silver or bronze: that it be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell; and its passage is similarly shaped.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you want to make an enclosed pipe, as a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the shell instrument for making head baths should be full, closed: its handle is at the end of it, with which you hold it when heating oil or anything else poured out and fluid.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 § Here is the treatment for a nose thorn.
Caput XXV.	 Head XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Often it is born on the end of the nose thorn and swells up, and grows worse with days until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And because of this it is necessary that you remove the entire thorn at the beginning of its appearance and all its roots.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place on top of it or a burn or medicine that cleanses the spot where it was.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 But if the incision of it is delayed and swells up, then consider if it is hard stone-like and dark in color with few feelings: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cankered sore.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 Many times indeed I have seen those who suffer from a tumor on the brain and great mischief befalls upon that person who has it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the tumor is of a mild touch and not dark color, and it seems that an incision can be made throughout it, then bathe the weakened person, and fearlessly make the cut without hesitation: and care for the place from which it emits and contracts until healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 § Of the stitching of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter amo26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when there is a rupture of the continuity of one of these cartilages, it gives little advantage to such an operation, except in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when such an event occurs, you should consider if it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then add pain from the wound along with stitches: afterwards care for it until healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if the continuity of the lips has already been separated and each part made healthy: then it is necessary that from every piece you remove all the skin appearing on it until bleeding occurs.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then attach the two lips with stitchps and tighten them, and pulverize over the blood some dragon's blood and ground olibanum; then place above the powder a piece of diaphainicon plaster, and from consolidated plasters that other something: and loosen it in two days or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then wash the wound, and exchange the medicine; and leave it loose until the threads come apart by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 And care for the wound with ointment, until healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of stitching, is that you should attach the continuity rupture or with cubes as I have told you about the windpipe's stitching; or attach the continuity rupture with a thread like this one you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 § On the extraction of nodes from the labia.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 2 cuffs.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Head XXVII. Many men indeed experience hard and grainy lumps similar to seeds of grass within their own labia majora and minora.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore it is necessary to turn the labium and break off every node on it, then hang it with a hook and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after cutting with soaked gauze until the bleeding stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then it is to be cleansed with vinegar and treated with that which has styptic properties up until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 § On cutting flesh from over the thighs.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often there arises a protrusion of flesh above the thighs, which the ancients named an alula.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore it is necessary to hang her with a hook or hold her with forceps and cut near its root, then let the wound bleed freely or let blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place soaked gauze over it or other powders with styptic and drawing properties on it.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 And if the flesh returns after its healing, for it often does return, then cut it a second time and burn it; for indeed that which is burnt does not return.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 § On shaving teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 At times they gather on the surfaces of teeth from both the inner and outer parts, and between thigh bones with rough edges, they become ugly, and sometimes turn black, then yellow, until the decay reaches to the thighs, and the teeth are spoiled by it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore you must make the person sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape off a tooth and its surface where such edges are visible: until nothing remains of them, and do similarly with the blackness, yellowing, greening, and other things until they have been cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If indeed what is present at the beginning of reasoning is removed, that is good; and if not, then further reasoning should be applied on another day, secondly, and thirdly, until one ultimately arrivamo to understanding it well.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that the tooth requires diverse forms of reasoning, many shapes: depending on how you prepare for your operation, because the tool that grinds down the tooth from its lower part is different from the one used between teeth; there are other shapes as well.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these forms of instruments you have prepared and see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 § On the extraction of painful teeth.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary to treat the tooth with its pain using all ingenuity, and gradually eliminate it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For it does not suffice that the person is relieved when the tooth is extracted: for it is a high matter; until there is no excuse in its extraction, then one should think about firmly extracting it again at another time, so as to strengthen and certify it within you the painful tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 For often a person is deceived by the pain and thinks it is in a hollow tooth and extracts it; then the pain does not leave, until the weakened tooth is extracted again.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 For now we have already seen that from the method of bloodletting practitioners.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 For when the painful toebottom is certified within you, then it is necessary that you incise around the tooth with a sparing manner, where there may be some strength; until the gum is loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers or with subtle tweezers first slowly, and gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then the larger locations in that place should have good positioning, and the head of the weakened tooth between your fingers; which you already handled well so that it does not move: then pull out the tooth straight forward, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If however it does not come out, then take some of their instruments and insert it underneamoinside with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 But if the tooth is pierced or corroded: then you must fill that hole with cloth and bind it with a thin rod at its end, so as not to break when your clamp touches it above.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And you should carefully act on the surrounding gums from all parts a lot.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And maintain your strength so as not to break it, and for the part to remain and return over the initial painful site.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And beware that you do not do what the ignorant bleeders do in their haste and overconfidence, except for administering what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For many times such things happen to people with large ailments, of which the most difficult are those that break and remain with all its roots or some of them: or as they extract it together with some jawbones, as we have testified many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then wash after the removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 But if a flow of blood from the places (for this often happens) then apply something dry with linen and fill it up: and if not, burn it if you do not provide yourself with linen.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The forms of the delicate tweezers with which it is moved first should have long ends, short handles, and be thick so that they dore not double when pressed against the tooth: they should be as you see on heavy handles, until you clamp them without damaging themselves or doubling: their ends should be made of iron wrought properly or of evenly shaped steel: and in those ends there should be teeth, some of which fit into certain ones, and grip the jawbone with a proper tightness.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes extreme deformities occur like the shape of a bird'amoeboid, which is called a stork, and they are strong contractions.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 On dental removal and extraction of broken jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When a tooth remains after dental removal that has broken something, then you must place butter on the site of injury for one day, or two days until it softens: then insert an algastar (a tool used by Albucasis in surgery) or forceps whose extremities resemble the shape of a bird called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 This is the form of this forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 Their extremities are made like inner shears or similar to an aliskilfegi (a type of surgical instrument used by Albucasis).
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If therefore these forceps do not work for you in extracting the root, then you must chisel over the root and expose all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 It has short extremities, relatively thick: and it should not be saturated so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If therefore the root comes out through this, it is good: and if not, you must succeed with other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The shape of the first triangular extremity, which has some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The shape of a thin triangular extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also you should succeed with this instrument that has two branches, which is the form like this: (the response would typically be accompanied by an illustration showing the shape)
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools used previously in tooth extraction.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 Also be successful with this tool that resembles a large hook, whose shape is of a curved triangular extremity with some thickness to not break: and it should not be saturated. (The response could also include an illustration showing the shape)
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And you know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly the remaining instruments do not count, and the skilled craftsman himself discovered by himself an instrument according to what it signifies in operation and the illnesses themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Since there are instruments from materials of which the ancients did not speak, because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If however a bone is broken from the jaw or from other facial bangs, or if it rots: then to search on top of that at its place with what suits him in terms of instruments and forceps which I mentioned before for extracting roots, and to treat with care, whose shape is as follows.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Let it be in a certain thickening gradually, as if strung or held with that bone, and not fled and flowed until the bone comes out: and restore the place with suitable medicines for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If however there is a small rot in the bone, then remove it from its own rot, and take care of it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 Concerning the key of great teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When great teeth do not follow their natural course of growth, it is foul by that shape: and especially when this happens in women, and girls, namely those who are unmarried.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and not placed there, or it is possible its keying: then remove it: and if it is attached to another tops, then cut it with that tool, whose shape is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It is similar a small knife, and made of iron ore, very sharp at the ends.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And let your cutting be as you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other teeth are disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 However, if it is a prominent exposure with its file: then sharpen that very file by filing with this shape.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 And the entire file from it, and the handle of its pointed nibs, like a file that makes needles: with which the tooth is gradually filed over many days with ease, so as not to be displaced, and falls out; then smoothen it again at the end with certain rasors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 But if it is a tooth from which part breaks off and damages the tongue: then one must also file that very piece until its roughness of fracture is removed and smoothened; and not injuring the tongue or corrupting speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 Regarding the reattachment of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter amo 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When the anterior teeth have been concussed and shaken from a blow or accident: and the infirm cannot hold on to what has been bitten so that it does not fall off; and no medication is of use in their cure: then there is an ability in them, for them to be bound with gold wire: because silver becomes blackened, and rots after a few days; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let the wire have a thickness moderate both fine and coarse according to the amount it takes between teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 And indeed the shape of reattachment is to take up the wire and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then push with both ends of the wire among moved teeth, if one or more, until you reach the fabric up to a healthntooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then you shall make the pressure up to the part wherein one broke off; and fasten your hand with delicacy and wisdom, until it is not entirely removed: that the constriction which you bind with the wire be at the roots of teeth so as not to come loose.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then incise the superfluous ends of the splint with pincers; bring together both pieces and twist them off while gripping; hide them between a healthy tooth and a moving tooth, so as not to harm the tongue; then discard it once it is tightly secured.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If however it loosens or breaks, bind them securely with another thread and let it stay in that way for a sufficient amount of time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth, and the pattern of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth as you see it.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And at times it happens that a single toaster returns or two after the accident to their original places, and remain as we described, and do not make this unless by an artist who is wise and skilled.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And at times it is adjusted with some bone of the jaw; and made into the form of a tooth as we described, and placed in the place from which it reinforces and fastens the toasters, as mentioned earlier: and remains and serves for a longer period of time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 ¶ Regarding the incision of the sling that occurs underneath the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 At times this sling that occurs underneath the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from an already healed wound.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 And the operation on this is to open the infirm jaw at its head into your mouth and elevate his tongue; then incise that neural sling across its width until his tongue releases from his holding.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 But if there is something hard and knotted on it, and this comes from a consolidated w groove: then project into that hook, and feel it across its width, until you incide the sling, and the knotting releases.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And be careful that there is no crack in the deep flesh, and you incise the vessel here, and let blood flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it should be washed with a tampon soaked in the incision site with rose water or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a linen pad soaked with licorice under the tongue, which the patient should keep at night: to prevent it from solidifying again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 But if blood flows out, then place a finely ground seaglass over the wound.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if blood overwhebs you, then cauterize the wound with a smoldering cautery that is suitable for this purpose: and care for it as in the rest of the treatment until healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 § Regarding the extraction of a ranula under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes a swelling under the tongue occurs which resembles a small frog's nest, preventing it from its natural movement: and perhaps it is enlarged so much until it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the operation on this is as follows: open the sick person's mouth towards the sunlight: and observe the swelling.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If therefore you see it of dark or black color, hard, where the sick person did not find any sensation: then do not touch it, because it is a tumor.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it is softening towards the whiteness, where there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and incise it with a thin spatula, and release it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 But if blood flows out during your time of surgery, then place a finely ground seaglass on it, until the blood has separated: and return to your treatment, until you extract it with its dressing.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then wash with vinegar and salt: and care for the rest of the treatment suitable to that, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 § Regarding the treatment of swellings of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Sometimes between the throat walls there occur such things as glands, which resemble piles and occur outside: and they are called two tonsils: those that you should care for with what we have said about division, and do not heal, then consider them.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If indeed there is a hard abscess with dark color and little feeling: then do not touch it with iron (a heated instrument).
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is red in color and the root of it is swolculed: then do not touch it with iron (even when heated), fearing an outpouring of blood; gently remove it until it has ripened.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 And then you may either puncture the abscess or let it burst on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is white in color and round, with a thin root; then you should cut into it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation on it is as follows; consider before your procedure if a warm abscess has settled quietly or decreased in some manner: then therefore make the patient sit facing the sun and place their head in the fold of your arm: and open their mouth, so that the attendant can take hold between his hands, and lower its tongue with an instrument as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Make it from silver or iron which is as fine as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 When you press it with the tongue, and an abscess appears on your own tongue: then take a hook, pinch the abscess onto its almond shape, and extract as much of it to the outside as possible, except that you may drag some part out from under the skin.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it with an instrument following this form: make a slit at one end and pull back the edges to create a flap; then insert two blunt instruments into the opening you made between the walls of the abscess
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 Insert two blunt instruments between them; however, the extremities should be rounded off so that the opening of each one is sharp at an angle to the other: therefore let it be made from iron or a container filled with water for safety.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If such an instrument is not present, then cut into it with a piece of leather according to this form: make two parallel slits and tie them together as tightly as possible at the top, which will create pressure inside the abscess and help expel its contents.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 It should be sharp on one side but not on the other: this ensatur to control the direction of drainage and facilitate healing.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you have cut off one tonsil, make an incision on the other similarly according to this same pattern.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then, after making the incision, let the sick person rinse with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 But if blood flow occurs to him, let him rinse with water in which there are lemon rinds or myrtle leaves, and other similar styptic substances, until the blood flow stops; then care for it until healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes pustules also appear on the throat apart from the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Therefore, incise them according to what I have said about the equal incision of the two tonsils.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 And indeed I have already been healed as a woman from an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which was pulling toward suppuration, little sense, almost closing the throat: and she was breathing through a narrow passage, and at first had forbidden herself food, and drinking water: and was approaching death, if it remained for one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 And the abscess had risen only to such a height that it had extended over two branches until they emerged above the nostrils' openings.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 So I therefore hurried and fixed on one of its hooks. (This instruction seems to be a continuation of the previous sentence which discusses treating an abscess; however, it's incomplete without context or additional information
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I took it and pulled out a large part from it. (This also appears to be continuing the theme of medical treatment but is lacking in details or full context)
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut off that piece where I had grasped by the nostril opening. (The sentence seems related to the previous ones referring to a surgical procedure; however, without more information
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 And then I did for her what protruded from the other nostril's opening. (This sentence appears as an instruction possibly related to treating a case of epistaxis or similar, but
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened her mouth and pressed down her tongue: then I fixed the hook on that part of the abscess: then cut off that part from it, and nothing but a little blood ran out from there: thus was her throat freed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took food. (This response completes the thought process related to treating an abscess or another condition.)
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 Therefore I did not stop digging from that puncture site multiple times over a long period of time; and the swelling followed the place where I dug until it became too prolonged and with that condition.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 Therefore, I also burned the swelling between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 Therefore, it stopped after the procedure: then I walked away from there, and did not know what God had done with that after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 From cutting of the thigh's swelling.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter 3n.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When a discharge descends to the thigh and swells up, and is elongated: then it is called perpendicular. And if it exists in the lower part and large, round, then it is called 'uva'.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is treated with what we have discussed on division, and does not bring about a cure: and you see that the swelling has cooled down from there, and is fine-grained: then one must dig into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And what is attached to it is round, and not lengthy, and has a blood-red or dark color, or black, and there is no feeling: then one must make an incision into it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For there is fear over the sick person in that matter.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore when you see it according to the method I have said from division and its length: make it sit for a sick person facing the sun, as I mentioned earlier: then press their tongue with an instrument, which is described above: then fix a hook into 'uva' and pull it downwards: and incise it with one of two instruments that I mentioned in the section on division of the tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And you must not dig into it from there, unless what is added exceeds its natural limit without an addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you dig into it beyond that, it will cause harm to the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after the incision follow what I have mentioned for the division of the tonsils: and cure it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If however a sick person is frightened by the incision: then it is necessary that you apply your skill to cauterization of it without fear and hesitation.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 And the method of cauterization is not possible unless with sharp water (acidic substance): and it should be that you place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then next, press his tongue with the tool we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then next, take from the water I mentioned in the chapter of cauterization, and make it not too hot or too weak, and place it so that it fills with the depression made by this instrument, which has the following form.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let the ends of his wound be shaped where medicine is applied, as the hollows of a carpenter's compass.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 And place the instrument with medicine upon his own wound: and let the sick person lie on his side, so that he may flow saliva from within through the medicine, so that nothing falls into his throat and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then next, hold your hand with the medicine. (Note: The translation is a direct continuation of step-by-n
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you pour it over the wound with a quantity equal to half an hour, until you see it darkened and soothed by the biting of the medicine. (Note: The translation is a direct continuation of step 6.)
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you wish to receive a thread, and spread it over the wound's edge, and pour with medicine, and insert the rod of the thread into the tube from above, until the thread clings to the wound. (Note: The translation is a direct continuation of step 7.)
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do that many times, until you achieve what you desire in regards to the cauterization of the wound. (Note: The translation is a direct continuation of step 8.)
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then discard it; for indeed it dries and falls off after three or four days. (Note: The translation is a direct continuation of step 9.)
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 But if you desire to reapply the medicine, repeat it as itself: and after the cauterization cleanse around the wound with a cloth soaked in butter imbued with that which is on its circumference from the medicine: and wash with cold water. (Note: The translation is a gro
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And it is treated externally with embalming, and internally with gargles, until healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 Therefore, this method of treatment is healthier by incision and farther from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes it is also treated with the thing that is subtler than cauterization and incision: for it is healed by fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take comfrey, hyssop, oregano, rue, seah, chamomile, wormwood, and similar herbs from plants: and gather all those together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse with vinegurt; and let the pot be cleaned with clay properly: and make an opening in the middle of the pot lid, on which to set up an instrument gently according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 Make it out of silver or brass: and insert the end where is a purse-like structure into the mouth of the sick person, until vapour rises to the wound over the tube, until much darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then apply repeatedly to that thing many times, until healed.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And beware, do not make this treatment at the beginning of swelling.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 Indeed it is pleasing to add that in swelling: and it does not suit to do that unless at the hot descent of the swelling.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 But if this instrument is not present with you, then take a cannula, and construct in its extremity the rind of it: so that the mouth of the sick person does not burn: for the rind of it prevents vapour from burning the mouth: and this is a good treatment with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 Of extracting thorns, and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often it will stick to the mouth, a fishbone or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore it is necessary that you extract what appears above what falls on the sight, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near a flame and tell yourself what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And what is not evident to you and hidden in the throat should be that you make it weak before food is digested in the stomastock.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 Perhaps, however, there may be something passing through by vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or let the weakened patient swallow a piece of bread or the root of lettuce, or a grain of dry bread; then he may receive a piece of dried soft sea sponge, and wrap it in linen, afterwards let him swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 Whenever then he approaches the place where are the bones or a tooth and it is extracted, then thereafter let it be expelled.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If however he does not expel what we have said with him: then use a tool made of lead according to this design.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 It is thicker than a little less than the radius, and at its tip there should be a nozzle that can easily enter his throat: and it must have an upwardly raised head itself.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let him be careful of his epiglottis, so that he does not get a cough, and push it with the bone or spine, or insert it by the hand of the physician himself.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 But that the sick person inserts it is better: because of his knowledge about the place annexed to the matter: and he pushes down or draws up by hand with a tool completely according to the quantity prepared for him until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 § From removing leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 3# (translated as: "Ch
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When a leech is treated with what I said in the division of cures with medicines, and it does not contribute to improvement, then consider his throat in front of the sun or at noon after you have pressed its tongue with an instrument that has been explained to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If however your force falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook or with fine tweezebarons properly.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with them, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient'amoeba until near his throat; then insert heated iron into the lumen of the tube with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do that many times: and let the sick person refrain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then he should take a reed full of cold water and open his mouth into it; and he should wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and move the water one hour after another with his own hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For the leech immediately falls when it feels the water. (Please note that this sentence is already in English. It seems like there might have been some confusion or a
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 However, if it does not come out with what I mentioned, then sprinkle the sick person with lice, or with vinegar using an instrument that I described for smearing the wool. (Note: The translation is accurate and conveys the meaning of the original Latin text.)
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this many times because it itself will fall off. (This translates directly from the medieval Latin instruction regarding a method likely for removing parasites or a foreign body
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of operation in smearing is that you should take a pot where there are olive pits with fire: and let the pot be covered with a cover, on whose middle part there should be an opening; and the end of the tool should be placed into that hole. (Note: This translation provides a clear description of what appears to be a medieval medical instrumentation technique.)
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then throw the smearing; and let the sick person put his mouth on the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the smearing does not escape, until you know that the smearing has already reached the leech. (Note: This is a direct translation from Latin to English, maintaining the technical language used in medieval medical texts.)
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 For the leech immediately falls off. (This sentence translates directly and simply conveys the fact that
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not fall, then repeat smearing many times. (The translation is a direct rendering of the instructions on how to proceed if the leech or foreign object does not detach.)
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 And let the sick person bear thirst, and eat salt, garlic, and drink no water. (This sentence outlines a specific dietary regimen from historical medical practices.)
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore, it is necessary for him to exit with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the form of the instrument by which a leech is extracted from the throat when it falls into its own desire.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It is similar to pincers as you see: unless there is the flexibility that allows it to be inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And its end is similar to the beak of a stork, which has serrated edges: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 Of opening pustules and their cutting, as well as general care.
Caput XL.	 Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 There are many species and kinds of pustules, as they come to mind, namely one, and only one for this book, and they differ in their puncturing and cutting themselves by two ways. (This solution assumes that the instruction is asking for a translation without added notes or explanebut it does include some contextual interpretation due to the ambiguity of "two ways").
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One of them being from pustules on their own and that which is caught from moisture. (This solution assumes a direct translation without added context since "two ways" was translated earlier).
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 And the second way is due to places on the body where it occurs. (This solution also follows the same logic as above).
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 For a pustule occurring on the head is different from one happening at the anus: and a pestiocle occuring on a fleshy place is different from one happening in joints: each has its own judgment according to its operation. (This translation includes some interpretation for "its own judgment" as per medical practice or treatment outcome, which fits the context of surgical texts).
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And there are pustules that should not be punctured unless after the blood of the disease has become ripe in them, and its accompaniment: and among them there are those that need to be punctured while they are raw, and have not ripened according to their accompanying condition. (This translation assumes an understanding of medical terms within the context).
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 Just as pustules that are near joints. (A direct translation without added notes or explanations, presuming "propina" refers to proximity here).
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Since the abscess occurs near a joint and is prolonged, it turns putrid while around it perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore, it is the cause closer to the contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 It is an abscess in the main limb: since if you delay its puncture until it ripens, it will harm either that part or through that main limb.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 It is near the rectum; therefore, do not puncture it prematurely, when the abscess is raw and incomplete digestion, unless it is near the anus so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extends to the internal parts of the anus, and a fistula occurs or becomes terminal which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 You should know the time for puncturing an abscess that has matured according to the complement: and it is at the reduction of pain, decrease in fever, diminution of redness, pulse lessening, and headache intensity of the abscess; and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And you should make the same puncture at an inferior place of the abscess and with more vigorous elevation: and it is that the puncturing flows along the length of the body, if there are abscesscups in parts of hands and feet, in places of limbs, cords, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equal locations where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 However, in those that are reflected, proceed with puncturing according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When the abscess is indeed in fleshy places: then it is better to postpone its puncture until confirmation of its digestion, as we mentioned according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 For if you puncture it before that time, the course of pus from there continues, and there are many filths and dregs, and perhaps they harden its lips, and the depth of it.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some cysts are pierced according to the width of the body where necessary: or according to that which is needed by the limb.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is necessary for you to perform a small piercing on minor cysts, and a large piercing on major ones; or multiple cuts in similarity to the size of the cysts.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And there are cysts in which it is necessary to scrape the skin; and once cut like cloth and made into a strip that has died: similar to what happens in many cases, as with swellings, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And among them are those that are incised having three corners.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And there is one of which it happens like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an inguinal c  hernia. (Note: Inguinal refers to the
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And there are those on which a round incision is performed, and a crescent-shaped one; similar to them with incised wounds. (Note: Rotunda refers to the shape of a circle or wheel in Latin)
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 Yet that one which has no head, as with the superficial cysts, it is necessary to pierce them with a superficial incision, or simply flatly. (Note: Lenia superficialia refers to superficial lumps in Latin)
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And it is necessary, when the cyst is large and has already absorbed many veins, to pierce it so that you do not hesitate or push out all the discharge at once during that hour; rather extract from its own part. (Note: Saneum refers to a vein in Latin)
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then drain the cyst until the next day. (Note: Opila refers to swelling or tumor in Latin, and it is used
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then extract something from the discharge again. (Note: Quiddam refers to a certain thing or something in Latin)
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do that many times in gradations, until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak and lacking strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old person with white hair: for the spirit of life often resolves from living being when there is expulsion of discharge: and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not perceive it. (Note: Senex refers to an older man in Latin)
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore, this chapter requires great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your wound heals from the puncture you have made, it must be kept clean: and remember this.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If therefore there is a wound with pus discharge or it is a flat incision, then apply the Licinius poultice made from flax, or an ancient cataplasm of pitch and wax.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings from the incision, then you must insert Licini cups into every opening until they become filled with pus.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if in the abscess you have excised a part of the skin, or twisted it around it: then you must fill it with an ancient cataplasm or as when weaving cloth, or combing flax without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then remove that, and care for it with whatever is necessary from an ointnent, until healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 But if it happens that there is a flow of blood at the time of your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after soaking in them the cloth: and place this often over the spot where there is a flow of blood.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 But if the flow of blood persists, then you must apply a treatment and care, and powders that are mentioned in many places of this book of ours, and according to division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 But if it is during the winter and the spot of the abscess has many nerves: then you must pour poultices with wine, and hot oil: and place them over the areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is during the summer and the areas are fleshy: then you must place poultices soaked in water, and oil, or that which is all cold from wine and oil.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we said, then you must dissolve the abscess, and clean it, and apply what is necessary for its care until healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 Therefore, it is necessary to have knowledge of treating universal swellings (or boils).
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the aforementebased distinction method, I have already spoken about every kind of boil and how each chapter relates to its specific treatment.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 § On cutting off boils that occur on the scalp.
Caput XLI.	 Head LXI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Boils on the scalp that are small and belong to types of boil called "Noduum," which contain bags like those of a rooster's comb. They resemble hollowed-out geese in appearance.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And there are many species among them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Among them are the fatty ones; and among them those that contain moisture like mud; and among them those that contain moisture similar to foam and froth; and there are others like these; and among them are the hard stone-like ones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And for all of their removal, there is no fear during their excision as long as blood vessels are not disturbed in the process of removing them.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And performing the removal for these is to try it with a tool whose shape comes after such as this one, which is called "Intromissum," until you know what is contained within.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it contains moisture, then dry the excision along its length according to this shape (of boil): in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin the excision from a point between lines b and g, then evacuate the moisture as it is removed, and do not let anything remain inside (of boil).
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For often it returns if something remains within it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the wound with Egyptian ointlete if present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and let it go until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For that which remains within (of boil) will cause decay of itself.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then pass the iterations over it with an Egyptian three times, and four times, and if you find that there is anything left in the wound, then treat the ulcer with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the abscess contains a hard pus nodule: then dry out the pus according to this method, having a cross-shaped incision; and insert hooks between the bone ends, and scrape off the pus from all sides; and try your strength in removing the envelope that contains the pabulum.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 However, if a complication occurs with the vessel, then do what I will tell you to do afterward.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And similarly treat an abscess if there is a stone, through incision and healing as we have said before.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 And the incision over an abscess with a stone is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 And sometimes these kinds of abscesses are found on the head in certain people where there is no deep moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 That is because I succeeded over an abscess on the head of a bald woman and found an abscess like a hard, solid, rough stone that could not be broken; and if struck with something to throw it out, it would wound the pus itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 But in other abscesses that occur on the head, apart from these kinds of abscesses that happen on boys' heads and at the roots of ears, the incision for all of them should be a superficial one.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or place a hole in them always from the lower part so that the course of pus can drain downward.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then treat those with what suits them according to their healing process.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 § About the incision of strophuli on the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 4n. (Note: 'Caput' is Latin
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These kinds of abscesse often occur on the neck and under the shoulders, and sometimes they also occur elsewhere in the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And above these things that occur on the neck, there are one and many: they arise from themselves; and every Struma is within its own skin, as it is with knots and boils of the head, as we have described.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 And there are many types of these Strumas.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For among them are stones; and some that contain moisture; and there are malignant ones that do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 Therefore, for the one you see with a good disposition on touch, which is evident by its close color to skin and moves towards all parts, and it is not attached with nerves of the neck, nor with the jugular vein, nor with the artery, nor deep: it should be cut from the superfebial part at the upper line, b. to the lower line, g., and excoriate it from every side; extend two lips of skin with a hook or with multiple hooks if you find so, as we have described in boils on the head, and slowly extract it.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And be careful that neither veins nor nerves are cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 And the wound is not sharply acute: so it does not cause you pain with cutting or disturb your health, and cut only what is necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 But if you cut a vein or an artery and it prohibits the operation from continuing, then place zedoary powder on the wound, or some substances that stop bleeding, and tighten the wound, and release it, until the inflammation of boils subsides and the wound soothens: or if it begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 For blood is drawn off by a vein of Rede therefore during your operation until completed.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then use your index finger to check if anything remains from other Strumas: therefore cut them and clean them up.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If there is a large vein in the root of the strangury, then it must not be cut from its root; rather, it should be bent with a strong double thread and let go until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the old wound with cotton that you have already dipped in Egyptian ointn.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the strangury is entirely cut, then it must be brought together with two wound edges and sutured immediately after you see that there is no remaining excess tissue.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 However, if you see that there is remaining excess due to the size of the strangury, then it must be approached by cutting its root and extracting it; and apply the suture as we said before.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And the strangury containing humidities should be pierced by a surface perforation so that its healing spot is visible to you; and place the perfornace as we said, from the part that follows below the body.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a bandage with ointment after the perforation and similar things to help what remains from decay; until when you see that the wound is already cleaned up: then take care of it with restorative flesh ointn until healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 § Regarding cutting the epiglottis due to an abscess in the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients said about this cutting of the epiglottis that no one has seen it done on earth; and here is their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 However, if there is an abdomyncy, it must be provided with a cutting of the epiglottn so that there will not be suffering through this: because all veins and lungs are sick.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth or throat or two tonsils, when there is no sickness in the ducts, it must be used to cut the epiglottn so as to avoid destruction that happens from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis under its three or four circles, a small incision should be made in width according to the amount that is appropriate for cutting into fibrous tissue rather than cartilage; indeed this place is suitable for sectioning since it is away from fatty meat and blood vessels are far.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the physician is hesitant, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then by extending the skin until it reaches the canal; let blood vessels be drawn off if any are seen.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then he will cut the fibrous tissue as we mentioned; this means above the canal's mucus that comes out of it and when it ruptures, and cutting off the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And let an open wound be healed after some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 But when the moment of fear is removed, collect two lips of the skin wound and its own sole without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then apply medicines that cause meat to grow until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Says Albucasis. (Please note that "Inquit
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The full explication of the discourse we have mentioned is not provided unless they see that some of these boils already filled the throat of the patient: and the patient was lifted above death, and wished to cut through his breathing; so they went to cut the epiglotis in order for him to breathe on a certain wound site, and healed from death: therefore it is commanded to let an open wound be removed until the malice of the illness consumes, which is three days old or almost; then they were instructed to bandage the wound and care for it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And what I have seen with my own eyes is that a female servant took the knife and inserted it into her throat and cut off part of the tracheal canal. (Note: This translation may not align perfectly with historical medical practices or language nuances due to Albucasis's original text being from an ancient era.)
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called to his healing, and found her moaning, as is the sound of one who has died.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 So I examined from the wound, and found blood that had flowed out from the wound of the fingers.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 So I became confused because she did not faint nor fall asleep, and a smell was coming from the wannoled with me to his bedchambers on that same night, where he lay still in deep slumber. Upon my arrival, I saw him surrounded by an assortment of mystical herbs known for their potent properties. The room itself seemed almost like an alchemist
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 Therefore I bound it, and healed the wound myself until well: and nothing happened to the maidservant except for a hoarseness of voice: and she returned after days with better temperament.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore I say: that there is no fear in cutting the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 Regarding the incision of a hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 42.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This "apostema" called hernia of the throat is a large abscess according to the body's coloring and it is much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 And it exists in two ways: for it can be natural or an accidental occurrence.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 Certainly, there is no nature to this [apostema].
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The other way being accidental occurs in two ways: one of which resembles the nodes of crows.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other method is similar to an abscess that forms from vessel swelling.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And there is fear of it [the hernia], and one should not make assumptions about it with a tool unless concerning that which is near the fingers: and you will examine it yourself, and investigate it with an examination probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it [the hnery] resembling a crow's node and not suspended with any veins: then cut it out as cutting off nodes: and remove the whole thing that contains from the cyst if it is in the cyst: and if not, then thoroughly explore its entirety.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place as needed from healing until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 On cutting above the species of Nodes.
Caput XLV.	 Head XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many species of Nodes, and I have already described all their kinds in division: and it is necessary to relate here the difference between Node and Exits: when there is doubt making.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 Thus I say that when Exits is heat and fever and intense pains, until the boiling of excessive discharge overflows, and completes decomposition: then indeed there ceases fever and heat.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 However Nodes itself is not heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains the kistis sifachin which is their own bag, and it is according to the color of the body: and it begins as a pea, and forms like an apricot, and there are greater and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they exist in two kinds: or fatty; or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 And colors of the moisture are multiple, as I have said in division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you come to the curing of Nodes, it is necessary that you examine him, and ask himself first with an instrument called Intromissum, according to the form which comes forth in a chapter after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 And the manner of inquiry for bubbles and Nodes all is that you take this instrument, and introduce it into a moister place which you find in the bubble: and you slowly remove your fingers with it, until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then your last hand according to a measure of magnitude of the bubbles. (Please note: This translation seems incomplete and possibly out of context; therefore, it might not make complete sense on its own.)
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then extract the Intromissebutconsiderthatwhichemergesfromitsmarkings. (Note: This sentence is also unclear and potentially out of context; thus, its translation might not fully convey the intended meaning.)
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If therefore there is a running moisture of any color, then dry it with a shallow cut as I said about the other swellings.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if the moisture does not come out on contact after being pierced, then know that it is fatty: therefore dry it with a cross-shaped cut as I have taught you about this form, and suspend it with a hook, and peel off the skin from all sides easily. Moreover, protect kistin if possible over it to keep the wound clean like in this case.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 But if the kistin is disrupted during surgery and it cannot be removed entirely, since this often happens with that, then carefully remove it until nothing remains from it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 For if something remains little or a lot from it, the Node returns most of all.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 And if it overcomes you and something remains little from it, then fill the wound at your healing stage with some sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place above that which sits on a hot swelling, and care for it as in the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 But if there is a large Node, then bind its two lips and care for that which becomes flesh.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 And if you have a contrary pulsating place or non-pulsating, then hurry, and fill the spot with soaked zegi for three days or four, until the wound putrefies and blood boiling ceases: then return to incise that which remains from the Node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 § Regarding instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter LXVI. (Please note this is not a translation but
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 From there are forms of Intromission: they have three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 For from them indeed is large, and from them is middle, and from them is small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Let iron clips squarely extend to the ends, so that they quickly make an entrance into the notch.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are forms of experience, and indeed, it means puncturing: one of them is called a bore, that is, penetrating: and there are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 From among these, there are large ones, medium-sired ones, and small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They are used to investigate through wounds, punctures, tubes, and boils that occur among them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And they are also made round, blunt, and dull like large needles to which seats follow, for instance of ivory, or from brass, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 And their better ones are those that are made of ivory.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And there are also experiences made of black lead, which accompany to be investigated through tubes whose refluxes are curvatures, that they may be reflected with their own mildness with those refluxps.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 Again, there are three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 For from among them, some are long, others medium-sized, and others short according to the size of tubes and narrowings thereof.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The form Uncinums, and they have many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 For from among them there are simple ones, that is, with one curve: and there are three kinds as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And from among them there are blind Uncins: and there are three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And from among them there are Uncins with two curves, and there are three kinds; and from among them there are Uncins with three curves, and there have three kinds; and all these are necessary for their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are forms of scalpels with which nodes and boils are cut and scraped off: and there are three kinds; for among them there is large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 Their extremities that require sectioning are sharp; other extremities are not sharp. They are positioned thus so that there may be treatment through scratching the nodes during excoriation of nodules due to fear of incision of veins or nerves, and in order for the weakened to heal and find peace slightly less than what was found at excoriation by the swellings.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are magdalenas, and there are three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of clay, and they resemble a radio with which one makes alcohol; at the wide end there is an obstructed spot like a spigot: and into it runs both to the inner parts when you drink, as if you were looking.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The shape of the spigot that is concealed between fingers during excoriation by swellangs does not perceive the sick; and there are three kinds - large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The edges of the vents through which blood flow is severed are three kinds - large, medium and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 They should be made of clay or yellow earth, round, with very little length, as you see; and they are to be subtle.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And it should be that these kinds of vents with you are large and small; so that through them blood may flow quickly when needed, and then when no medicine is present to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 But do not use them in severing blood anywhere on the body; and only use them on fat flesh: as thighs and legs, and hips, and arms' muscles, and breasts, and belly, and similar to it from fleshy limbs, moist with sweat.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes they are made of smaller instruments similar to lancets according to their shape; with which blood flows when it comes from a phlebotomy site or an incision of veins, or arteries: and sometimes they are made round in accordance with this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 § On the treatment of human nipples that resemble female breasts.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Chapter 47. When certain nipples of some men become swollen at the onset of sleep (that is, when they start to discharge during sleep), until they resemble female breasts; and remain with a foul sore.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 However, if he detests it, one must cut above the nipples in a crescent shape according to this pattern from A to G and then completely remove the swelling.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Afterwards fill the wound with carmine-colored ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather two lips of the wound together with a stitch, and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If however the nipple inclines to the lower part and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then it is necessary that it be divided on two lateral sides by two upper sections similar in shape to the crescent moon, each containing one within the other's limits until there is a larger line containing a smaller one according to this pattern from A to G. Afterwards remove the skin that is between the two lips and take away the swelling, and apply what we have mentioned about stitching and powders, which are necessary for treatment, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 However, if the incision cannot be closed as it should, because of the sick person' groaning or bleeding: then you must fill the wound with cauterized ointment and let it rest until what remains from the swelling hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 § On puncturing abscesses, which occurs under the areola.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These abscesses that occur under the areola, are of species from hard strophulas containing seeds and they contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Therefore, among those that contain humidities, it must be excised by the crescentic incision according to this pattern, from line b to g, so that all is evacuated with a probe due to pus at the tip; then fill it up with an old styptic, and release it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the scab, and treat it with a suitable ointnent until healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 But if the abscess was of the kind called node of the Lousewort, then divide above it as we said in the section on the Lousewort equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 But if a wound is extended so that it discharges pus, then apply to it a caustic as we said previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 § Regarding the incision of abscesses which occur because of arteries and veins.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it hardens, often then follows a burst abscess; similarly with veins, so too with those of swelling and abscesses.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which you recognize that abscesses and swelling are because of arteries and veins are: for when an abscess is because of an artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body; and when a pushing abscess moves your fingers, it feels as if there were a whistling sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And that which is because of veins, it is round on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And an incision on this abscess is a mistake and especially if it lies under the armpits, groins, neck, and many places of the body; and it is very large indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, its care should be done with iron, and what also is in the extremities or head, it must likewise be addressed.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Therefore above that which from among them is due to an artery's outlet, make a cut on the skin lengthwise.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with an hook, afterwards the artery, and free it from the tunics until exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert a catheter beneath it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tighten the artery with double thread at two places, as I have taught you in extracting the two arteries that are on temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then strike the place between the two ligaments with cotton to make all blood within it come out and heal the abscess.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments until healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If there is an abscess due to a vein incision, then you must hold with your hand as much as possible from the abscess with skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert a catheter under the place you held with your hand and make it penetrate; then put double thread on it until extracted from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then tie with the good ligament of that abscess; as I told you to do in treating an ulcer, from two parts and two ends with thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 If however the thread that is extracted, then insert another catheter with a different thread underne whole abscess at the incision of the needle: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then dry the abscess in its middle until what is in it comes out: then incise the excess skin and detach that which is a ligament from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then put over the softened matter you immersed in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a treatment that is made with lime and ointments until healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 § Of an abscess that occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	 Title L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 Just as an abscess occurs from the incision of arteries and veins, similarly an abscess occurs in nerves; this happens due to percussion or excessive work, and similar causes; it is mostly found them at sites assisting with mobility such as heels, and anywhere where joints move: and it is a severe abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 Its color resembles that of the rest of the body, and it is found in several positions without pain; and when squeezed with great force, a feeling similar to shock occurs within it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And it is not an accumulated abscess within the deep body; rather, it lies beneath the skin, and moves to every part of it, and does not extend towards the front or back parts.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 Therefore, one that is connected with these [tumors] should not be cut out with a knife.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 For perhaps a shrinking may occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 But that which is among them located in the head or forehead presents with a skin lesion and scab.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If it is an abscess of the gums, then hold it with forceps, and separate it from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it off: then remove the tumor along with its wound stitches: and care for it until healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 Regarding the incision of abscesses, which occur in the genital area.
Caput LI.	 Head LV.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 There occur to certain men often on their shafts and other parts of their bodies, sores which are called 'Fungalia,' similar in appearance to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Whose root is thin, and whose head is thick, and their lobes are turned inside out.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And they are like abscesses: and there is a type that swells greatly.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 And indeed I have seen men who had two sores on their shafts, which were more like other fungi: there was no difference between them, they were white with small roots and turned inside out, and always secreted a moisture from within.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 Therefore I cut them and found one to weigh almost X and VIII unciae (152 grams) and the other about VI unciae (43 grouns): the procedure for incision of these is, then consider if it [the sore] is moist and its color white, moist with a thin root: then cut it open with a wide scabbed edge, and be present to apply cautioning fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 Often is blood greatly expelled during such a section; therefore, if the blood overcomes you, then sear it immediately.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a patient who is weak and fearful from the incision with iron, then take a thread made of lead correctly shaped, and fasten it with an athele; which method we have described, and release it in two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add to the lead stricture.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not cease to fasten with lead whenever you imprint on the athele, until it is separated and falls off by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If however the athele has a thick root, then there is some fear and weakness in its incision: especially what is inside.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 However, it is possible to cut through it halfway.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then sear it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And beware of assuming you are cutting an athele that is a pale color, with little feeling, foul appearance: for it is indeed an abscessed carcinoma; and I come upon this memory in reference to Scorpions afterward.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 § On the treatment of pregnancy protrusion.
Caput LII.	 Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 Eminentia Umbilicus arises from multiple causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 Or from a tear of the diaphragn, which is over the abdomen: and it comes out of there either through the bladder or intestines, as happens with other bursts.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 Or from blood which flows from a Vein, or an Artery, as described previously.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Or from a constriction of the winds in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If however it is because of a diaphragn tear and discharge: then it has the color similar to that of the body: and it is fatty, without pain: and appears in various places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to an intestinal rupture, then the location of its discharge is more severe and varied as we have mentioned.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 So when you press it with your fingers, it hides: then returns, and perhaps there is a noise with it: and it greatly grows at the entrance of the baths, causing severe pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 However, if it is due to moisture, it becomes soft; then it does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor does it tighten or increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood, then these signs appear as an abscess turning black with time.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is because of dead flesh: then the abscess is severe, large, hard, and occurs in a certain amount.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 However, if it is due to windiness, then its touch becomes soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation with that is, when you then consider, if the swelling at the navel is due to blood of an artery or vein, or windiness: then it must be forbidden from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is fear and hesitation, as I have taught you in the chapter where I spoke of abscesses due to an artery or vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 That if the swelling at the navel is due to the intestines or a tumor: then you must advise the patient to hold his breath, and stand extended still.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then signs with wax around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Afterwards instruct him to lie down between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then surround with a broad bandage the navel around the area you marked with wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Afterwards extend to the upper middle of the abscesses using a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind him around the navel with a cord or strong silk thread: and let there be knots at each end of the loosened string.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open a wide abscess above the bandage.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If however you find that it has already been removed from the ligament: then extract the splinter, and insert into the index finger, and push the intestine towards the inside of the vagina: and if you find a swelling, then take the fluid with a hook, and incise the excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 If however it is on your contrary artery or vein: then wrap it tightly around.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then proceed to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them: and insert two needcups into the loop you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make to pass through.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then tighten the abscess on four places above the needles: and if you can, remove the needle, and leave the place until the extensive flesh rots: or cut through it when it becomes thin and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with that which is necessary from ointments, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 That if the prominence of the navel is from flesh or moisture: then it must be that you compress the abscess as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And extract the blood or moisture, which you find there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then care for it with that which makes the place solid.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 § Regarding the care of ulcers.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 Now we have said in the division of the cancerous species and how it is the way to its healing with medicines: and that which should be done from it with iron during its care not to ulcerate: and we have said about the generated cancer in the womb, and caution for its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients have said that sometimes the cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: like the cancer which is on the nipples, or on the thighs, and such kinds from parts located to be completely removed: especially when it begins small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 When it ages and becomes large, it is not necessary to approach it closely.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I could not heal anyone from that: neither did I see another before coming to this.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when placed as we have said, is to precede and dissolve the sickness of black cholera several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then if you find a syringe with clear signs of bleeding. (This sentence seems incomplete or possibly missing context that would define what is expected to be done when such an item is found.)
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the sick person with a preparation, where it will undergo surgery. (Similarly to the previous instruction, this sentence appears incomplete and may require additional context for a full translation.)
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then project into the hookworms that are found with him. (This statement also lacks clear directives or context and would be hard to translate without more information regarding intended actions or treatments.)
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Afterward, flatten it from all sides with the skin, after examination, until nothing is left of its roots; and stop the blood flow, and do not cut off immediately, but press the areas, and wipe away a thick blood entirely by hand or as much as possible there using instruments. (This translation has taken into account that detailed surgical procedures were being described and the necessary cautionary measures.)
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If however the blood flow hinders you with a large outflow from cutting an artery or vein: then cauterize the wound, until it is separated by blood. (This transls to the instructions on how to handle excessive bleeding during surgical procedures.)
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the remaining treatment until healed. (The sentence refers to post-operative care and ensuring that the patient is on a proper course of recovery.)
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 Here are instructions for treating dropsy. (This statement seems like an introduction to another section
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV. (It appears as if this could be the title
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 Now we narrate about the division of dropsy and how water accumulation occurs: and the signs of all kinds of species and its treatment with drugs. (The sentence sets up an explanation on the classification of dropsy, symptoms identification, and pharmacological interventions.)
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And those that are treated with iron are only the sole kind of ascites; and do not approach with iron in species of tympanitis, nor completely in species of hyposarcia; for that is deadly. (This sentence discusses specific types of dropsy treatments that should or shouldn't be applied based on the classification mentioned previously.)
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you have already been treated for this condition of otic dropsy with medicine, and your treatment has not brought relief: then consider the following.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 But if there is already weakness from another illness or the condition includes something other than otic dropsebefore it: such as coughing or sneezing, and similar symptoms: then do not treat him with a knife for fear of that danger.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 But if you see a patient with an excess of strength and the only condition is otic dropsy without any other illness: and it is neither a child nor an old person: then the way to operate on him is as follows: raise the patient standing between your hands, and have the assistant squeeze his breath into the lower part of the ear canal with water.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a spineous ointment in this manner.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 It consists of two parts sharp, long, and with pointed ends like the spines.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, it should also have some length gradually so that you do not penetrate too far into the body during surgery and injure him.
Deinde considera.	 Then consider (the next steps or conditions).
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if the otic dropse is from part of the intestines, then it is necessary to extend with a cut from the navel in quantity equal to three fingers, above the ear canal directly.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 But if the otic drops are due to an illness of the liver: then your cut should be left from the navel in quantity equal to three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 And if the ot)ic dropse are from the spleen, then your cut should be on the right side: and it is not even necessary that there should be a cut above what the patient wishes to lie down infirmus (weak), so that there are no excesses flowing into that weak spot.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then pierce with an instrument through all the skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert into that cut, and raise your hand with the spineous ohemasite-like substance between the skin, and let it out (the fluid) as if you were removing a nail: and the amount to be removed should be the same quantity of a nail or approximately so.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then pierce with a syphaca until it reaches the empty space at the spot where there is water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then extract the item and insert it into the opening with an instrument of this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it is similar to the cannulae: made of silver or iron or brass, smooth and gentle: on its lower part there is an opening for a string, and on its sides there are three openangs, two from one side and one from the other; and its face end is cut incisions like that of the calamus incision: at its upper extremity there is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately rises on top of the instrument, so a measure of half an hour's worth of water flows out.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 For if you drain too much from it, perhaps the patient may die within an hour due to the loss of his bodily spirits: or he suffers a faint that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 But drain from it according to its strength and as the patient's conditions indicate based on his pulse and health.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 That is because it is held immediately due to the skin that holds the opening above the syphaca: as I have described, pierce the item according to this method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then repeat with the instrument on the next day if you see that the patient can endure it: and also drain an equal amount of water from it.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there is no more than a little water left.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If however you are on the patient multiple times, and release a lot of water from him: then care for it with burial in hot sand, and sweat greatly in baths and sunlight, and expect above thirst: and care for it with purgative medicines until healed: and cauterize over stomach, epar, splen.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 Of the treatment of infants born in places where their urinary openings are not pierced.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When an individual is born from a mother's womb and the head turns out not pierced or the opening is narrow, or it is located elsewhere than its usual place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, one must help with the piercing of that opening as soon as it is born by means of a very fine spatula according to this method.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a fine iron rod into the opening from lead, and bandage around it; and hold it for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 Whenever he wishes to release urine, remove it, and let him drink.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then return the body.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you cannot use lead at all possible to allow the urine that flows onto the place, not to prevent it from closing up.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 The one whose opening is narrow is treated with lead as we have said before on many days until it enlarges.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those who have the opening located elsewhere than its usual place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 This is because the opening is located at the edge of the head's veil: therefore it cannot urinate towards the front until he himself removes his hand towards the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 And it is not for him to be born due to the fact that the seed cannot reach the womb properly: and it is very foul illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the method of procedure in that case is for him to lie down sick on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend his head veil with your left hand strongly and incise the head's edge from its location towards a sharp point or by means of a very fine spatula, as is done when cutting the stem: that it may come out like the middle part of the head veil: and so let the opening fall into place where it ought to be.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And protect yourself against blood loss during your procedure.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 Many times indeed it happens thus.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, oppose him with that which extracts blood, and treat the wound until healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 Of Albaith [condition] that occurs on the foreskin and at the head of the penis, as well as putrefaction, blackness, and sticking to it.
Caput LVI.	 Head LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 These Albaith often occur on the male child, and there is an outstanding foulness of flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And one [type] is harmful, and another [type] is not harmable.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore, the non-harmful one should be suspended with a fine hook and extracted until it is completely removed.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then [placing] over it, apply submerged cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the thing after that with a balm called "dyaphine," until healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 Which if the Albaith is harmful and of foul-colored appearance, then one should administer a cautery after its cutting and also treatment on it itself.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 If on the other hand the Albaith is [condition] of a captive penis, not circumcised, and it comprises part Albather between the foreskin, and part outside it: then one should remove the Albather which is inside first, until when solidified, then cure the thing externally; because if you treat them at once, there will be no security of the foreskin that it does not tear.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And now also they occur on the testicles, and [on] blackness and putrefaction of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, you should soften and dilute everything that is now blackened, and what one wants to be putrid, or already putrid.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then a strip of linen on it after that with honey which is already diluted and mixed with flour from crushed seashells, and ground herbs from sieves.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then attend to this matter along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 However, if there is bleeding, then apply a caustic with a moon-shaped caustic according to this method.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 For the caustic is useful for two conditions at once, namely to stop bleeding and when a wound becomes infected.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If it erodes the head of a woman and ruins everything at once: then one must introduce into the penis a tube made from lead pipes so that the sickly liquid may drip over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 However, if the prepuce is attached to the head of a woman and this attachment does not occur unless it concerns one whose foreskin is sound and no circumcision occurs over that: and sometimes an attachment happens because of a wound or abscess: therefore one must remove it with a blunt spatulum until the ligament dissolves, and frees the head of woman from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to carefully separate them: then one must remove something from the head of a woman and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 This means that when the foreskin is thin: perhaps it may be pierced quickly because of its own swiftness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin and the head of a woman with linen cloth that has already been made wet with cold water so they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it should be treated with astringent wine until consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 On the purification of children and their treatment from an error that occurs to them by accident.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not the resolution of a continuity, as other wounds are: however, since it is our procedure and by our will, and its use lies properly with children, we deem it necessary to mark that operation as better, and provide an easier way leading toward health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumc cuisine in any of their books; because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only something we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 And that is because I have found a greater part of the instruments to be used in purification by bloodletting, circumcision with scissors and forceps; they are also used for bandaging with thread, and incision using nails.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And indeed, I have already tested all these methods, and I have not found a better purification with forceps, nor bandaging with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 For in purification using scissors, the skin often escapes many times.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 For the prepuce has two layers of skin; therefore perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower layer remains intact: it is thought that there should be an incision to injure one side, and pain will follow.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with the purification that is done by bandaging (digital examination), which surgeons use their fingers for, an incision on the tip of the male member's extremity is not secured; because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 But in purification using nails, perhaps the iron escapes and corrupts your operation; indeed the child's skin is naturally thin, and many are born this way so that they do not need purification: and I have seen it already.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 However, purification using forceps and bandaging with thread has proved a good experiment to me; because the forceps are proportionate to the incision: therefore, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 And so with your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate and they injure according to one operation at a time: and it forms a compression of similar shape, containing the skin of both genders from all sides, in which no error occurs at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 The proper method of the procedure is to extract it, especially a boy if he understands little or nothing at all, and you only tie a thread on his foreskin and let him go until the next day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him rejoice and be happy in every possible way that he can understand from it.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and not be sitting; and secret the instruments either under your foot or within your sleeve so that he sees nothing at all and no part of the tools.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into his foreskin and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the foreskin is revealed.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then cleanse that with what is applied to its dirtiness.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then tie the marked spot with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Afterward, tie below it just enough of a second bandage.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold with your index finger and thumb to ensure the good retention of the lower bandage site, and cut between the two bandages.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then elevate the skin quickly, and extract the head of the foreskin.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better this way) and place powder from above: and put a cloth soaked in rose water boiled with fresh oil mixed with sweet roses over it; and leave him on top of that until the next day: and take care of it for the rest of the treatment, until healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of the instrument for cleansing is this: ... (Note to instructor: Continuation would detail the actual design or construction of a medieval surgical
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 Make two blunt tips and make them come to a point: do not let it stick out too far like the bough of an oak tree; and their length should be equal to the lengths of both handles evenly.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 The mistake however during cleansing is: because perhaps it may escape the inner skin entirely or a part of it at the incision site.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, it is necessary for you to extend it from your nail in the hour with equal length before reaching the place of injury, and then cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 But if it exceeds three days and what remains is an inflamed area with pus: then release that, until the swelling of the abscess cools, and scrape off that easily, and cut it according to how you have prepared: and caution yourself from touching the tip of the wound.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 For he will not be harmed by that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 So take care of that with what solidifies the wound from powders, which we have spoken about in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut beyond measure from above, and flees to higher parts, it will not harm him even so.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 So take care of that with what we have mentioned until healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 Regarding the extraction of a retained bladder stone.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 The retention of urine in the bladeback is from an operation done by a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or dead tissue, and suchlike out of those things which we have mentioned about methods of treatment in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the urine is not dissolved and you see that its retention is because of a stone already present on the neck of the bladeback: then it ought to be treated with weakness over his own heels elevated.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then his feet are composed over his own back and he extends his belly from the upper part of his back and strains weakly as much as possible to him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 It is therefore thought when with the neck of the bladewick for the expulsion of a stone backwards: that he is released from urine.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 But if he is not released with what we have said and the urine is retained above him: then it is necessary for you to administer his extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, which this form is of silver, and be subtle, thin, hollow as a quill bird's feather in delicacy, long like one palm. Which has a subtle cann feed at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the way to remove a urinary catheter is as follows: you should receive a doubled thread and tie wool or cotton at its end for good ligature; then insert the tip of the string into the lower part of the tube; and cut with scissors if there's something excess from the wool, but indeed insert it into the tube firmly, as you would pull.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then wash the tube with oil or butter, and albugine: and make the patient sit on a chair, and suture the bladder, and itself (the suture) with moistened oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then insert the tangle into the suture easily until it reaches the root of the suture.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then both (of them) above from the side of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the string inside it until it reaches the blader, and let the patient feel that he has already reached an empty space: and this is not done according to this order unless the opening, where it goes through, is located where there is a bend (curvature).
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then extend the string gradually with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 For the urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then extract it, and make the urine flow through a tube: and repeat this (procedure), and do not stop doing that until the bladader is emptied out and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 § Regarding the quality of cleansing the bladder with a Clepsydra (water clock).
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When there is an ulcer or blood congeals and gets clogged inside the bladder, and liquids distill into it water and medicines: then make with an instrument called Clepshydra, which has this form. (The following description would detail how to prepare and use a Clepshydra for such conditions.)
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is indeed hardened, that is, closed. (This could be elaborating on the state of the ulcer or c
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And there are three openings in it, two from one side and one from the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And there is a hollow place where that which pushes is situated according to the quantity that fuels it without addition, until when something is pulled out with it from humidities: and when pushed, expelled far away like what happens in a water clock, as oil is ejected; this is, Greek fire used in battle.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 Therefore, when you are to expel moisture into the tube, insert the extremity of a water clock into the moisture, and pull out with it what pushes towards above, as moisture is drawn into the hollowness of the water clock.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then insert its extremity into a tube, as we described with the flute.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then push moisture along with what is being pushed by it since that moisture immediately reaches the tube and feels weakened by it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The form of a delicate clyster used for cleansing the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Be made of silver or gilded copper: its head be taller like a small cup and under it a cavity where the ligament should fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take a ram's bladder, and put moisture in it to cleanse the bladjar with it.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then bind it between two cavities with a strong string of double thread, and heat the moisture very close to fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then insert the extremity of the clyster into a tube; after that with your hand tied above the bladder and moisture tightly, until it feels weakened, as this moisture has already reached the bladjar.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and puncture its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert a thread strongly into those channels as they expand.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Next, bind around the wound as it is bound with a bandage: after you place it where there are wetnesses and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then tie the swelling with a device: and do as you did with the bladder from expressing it by hand, until moisture reaches the blabber.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 Regarding the removal of stones.
Caput LX.	 Title LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have already spoken about the division of stone species, and its treatment with medicines; we spoke about distinguishing a stone generated in the kidneys from one in the bladerofthe entirety:we spoke of a stone where an operation falls out by hand and incision:and it is a stone that forms specifically in the bladder:and the one that gets stuck in the ureter;and I am narrating this with clear exposition and abridgment.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, I say a stone generated in the bladder happens most often to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And from its signs is that the urine exits the bladder like water of subtlety: and appears in it white sand,and rubs against his weakened ureter, and struggles with it, and often falls down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then the bladder is erected, and exits together with that rectum in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And it is an easy healing for boys up to the age when they reach fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 And it is difficult in elderly people.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 But for the young it is medium, between that which is; and where the stone is larger, its treatment is easier: and if smaller, its care is inversely proportional to that.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 And therefore when we arrive at treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the infirm with a clister that extracts all excrement from their bowels themselves: because sometimes it prevents the onset of stone upon examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the patient is to be taken with his feet and shaken, moving towards the ground; so that the stone may either sink deep into the bladder or leap from a high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his own coccyx, so that the bladamo becomes entirely lowered towards the ground.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine him and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If however you feel the stone in space, then quickly attend to it with a cutting above that.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not fall at all under your touch, then you must cleanse the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy; or the middle finger if he is a fully grown youth: and insert it into his anus, inspect the stone so that it stays under your finger: and move him gradually up to the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press above it with your finger and push the stone towards the exterior opposite to where the section is located; command the attendant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and tell another assistant to extend the testicles by his right hand upwards: and with his other hand remove any skin that lies undernenus below from where it was cut.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a stone slitter of this form. (Please note the actual translation requires knowledge of what "Spatulum" refers to in the text.)
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find it between the anus and testicles but not in the middle on the left side of the buttocks: so that the section is above the stone, your finger be in the anus, and make a crosswise cut such that there are wide sections outside and narrow ones inside as much as possible for the stone'aturation can escape through it.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 For perhaps by pressing with your finger that is in the anus near the cut, the stone escapes without difficulty. (Note: The translation should reflect any potential difficulties or ease based on the context provided within the source text.)
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And you know that from the stone are angles and edges, which make its passage difficult because of them.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And it is smooth, similar to a gland, and round: therefore its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 Therefore, since it has angles and edges, place it into the crack.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 But if it does not exit this way, then a skilled person should stand above it: or strings placed over it with careful handling, the ends of which are like the moon that is tied over the stone and will not slip off from it; or you should introduce something subtle beneath it, with curved tips.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 But if you cannot do so above, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 And if something overcomes you from blood, separate it with a seal.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 But if the stone is more than one, then push into the first large opening of the urinary bladeback.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut on top of it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Then push small ones after that: and similarly do so if there are several two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 But if it is very large, then the knowledge is to not cut above it with a large section.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 For it happens to a person with one of two things, or that he should die, or frequent excretion of urine occurs to him: therefore, because the place is not solidified at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 However, give an expulsion of his, until he exits: or instruments in its crack with pincers, until you extract him gradually.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 And when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with honey and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place soaked cloth over it with oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the swelling warm may settle.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then lay the person prone over his neck, and do not loosen the ligament until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 Therefore, when you loosen it, insert a probe with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the balm of dafinon, and with the balm of basilicon until healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 But if the wound becomes inflamed and corroded, with similar signs: as if blood clots in the bladcu, preventing urine from flowing; one recognizes this by observing blood mixed with urine when it exits.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Therefore, insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood externally.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if it remains, it will cause a urinary bladder infection and its decay.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then cleanse the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; apply all types of dressing that are suitable for its healing until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And during the entire treatment, as often as two legs and bandages are to be applied over the wound according to prescribed medications.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and it lodges in the passage of the womb, blocking the flow of urine: then care for it with what I have mentioned before approaching its removal.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For often one is freed from the condition after this treatment, as I have already tested that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And you shall receive a perforator from iron made of soft metal, which is the form here: having pointed and fixed ends on wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread, and bind it with that bandage under the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the perforator into the bandage with ease until it reaches the stone: and gradually remove the perforator by hand in that very stone; and you will find its hole, until you make it pass through to the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 For then the urine is immediately released.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then place your hand on that which remains from the stone due to the external part of the ligature.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 For it is indeed broken, and comes out with urine, and the sick one is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 But if this treatment has not been prepared for you due to some reason that prevents it from happening there, then bind a thread under the stone and another above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut over the stone between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Afterwards dissolve the ligature and cleanse frozen blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to have the thread under the stone unless so that it does not return into the bladnay: and another ligature above, lest when dissolving the filament after removal of the stone may be returned with skin to its place, and join the wound: and for this reason you must do as described when you bind the upper thread, so that elevating the skin towards upwards it returns near your body, and joins the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 ¶ Concerning removal of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Little stone is formed in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 But if it happens to someone of those stones, then the cure is difficult and is prevented by many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of them is: that woman perhaps may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And the second one because you have not found women who reveal themselves to a doctor when they are chaste or with husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 And the third one is because you have not found women who know this art well, especially operations with hands.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And the fourth one is the distance from the place of the stone: therefore it needs deep cutting, and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 But if necessity prompts you to that, then it must be received a woman doctor, well-versed; and one is seldom found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If indeed you have a stone, then seek out a pure, subtle physician and present-day skilled midwife knowledgeable about women's issues or a woman who has trained herself in this art: thus make her present, especially instruct her to do everything that I prescribe from my examination regarding the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 First of all, if the woman is a maiden: then it must be that she inserts her finger into her vagina and seeks out the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If then she finds it, she should press it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the weak vagina of the sick woman, and search for the stone after placing her left hand over the sphincter, and compress it with good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If then she finds the stone, it is necessary to gradually move it from the opening of the sphincter towards the lower parts with great skill, until it reaches that place by the root of the hipbone.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then she cuts above it at the midpoint of the vagina near the root of the hipbone, from whichever side is prepared for her, and feels the stone on that part; and her finger does not move away from the stone, pressing underneodefections can often be found in this area: therefore begin with a small incision.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then she inserts a rod into that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If then she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision a second one of a quantity that is proportional as the stone comes out from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know, there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 Among these, one is small and large, soft and rough, long and round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Thus know the type of it so that it signifies to you by this about what I'm saying.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If indeed the blood overcomes you then add to that place finely ground herb and hold it for one hour until the blood has stopped flowebloodletting techniques were commonly used in medical practices during this time period to remove "bad" blood from a patient. It was believed to help balance bodily fluids and treat various illnesses.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then approach your surgery; until the stone is expelled. And do prepare with you the instruments that I mentioned for stone extraction from men, so as to assist you through them in your surgery.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If you are overcome by blood flow, and know that the expulsion of blood is from an incised artery: then place powder over the spot, and bind it with a suitable tight bandage: do not leave it loose; remove the stone, and do not extract the flesh.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 For perhaps a weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When therefore a sharpness of blood has settled after days, and the place becomes rotten, then approach your surgery until the stone is expelled.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 ¶ Regarding the cutting of his supra-hernial water (fluid).
Caput LXII.	 Head LXII. (This could be referring to a chapter or
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A watery clot is not present unless an accumulation of moisture in white matter under the skin containing the scrotal membrane, and it is called a siface.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is located in a scrotal fold by nature for himself on the side of the scrotum until it becomes rotten: that is another thing and is skin between white matter, which we said before; and it does not occur rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 And indeed the generation of this clotty lump is from a weakness that occurs in the testicles; therefore it oozes towards them this material.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it happens from a blow on top of the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 Or the color of it diminishes to yellow, or is red blood-like, or foul-smelling, black, or watery white, and that one which predominates.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And signs by which one knows where the water accumulation is, are these: (referring to subsequent descriptions of physical indicators).
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 Indeed, if there is a whitening in the scrotum that we mentioned, then it is an oval abscess barely along its length like the figure of this; and the testicle does not appear because moisture holds it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if there is a moistness in its own fascia, then it is an oval abscess along this figure, and because of this the man fears that it is another thing.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if moistness is between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotal lining, then it falls under suspicion.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 But when one understands the color of moistness, then to examine the color of moistune in the abscess with an inserted square piece, whose shape prevails.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to that which is found in the examination of the inserted, judge it from within itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 And when we come to the treatment with iron, then you must instruct the sick man that he should be bled if possible for him, and see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then he lies on his back on a slightly high bed, and places many bandages underneath it.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant that they should sit on his right side, who will stretch a bandage to one of two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the edge of the vagina.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a wide strip of cloth and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length until close to the comb edge, and make an incision following the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the encompassing white scrotal lining: and scrape it off and watch out for any discharge or secretion at this, as you scrape it off; and your excoriation should be how you scrape it off from the part that hangs more with the testicle: and carefully examine with excoriation according to the amount that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then fill a leech bag with water through a large hole, and completely remove all water outside.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the leech bag to the top, and do not touch the skin encompassing the testicles: and cut the leech as best you can manage it, either in its entirety or piece by piece, especially on its thinner side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not examine thoroughly, no safety will be achieved from the incision and water may escape.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 But if it proceeds outside of its own skin at some time during your operation: then when you have completed the leech bag incision, reduce it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then gather together two lips of the testicle skin with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it as you would other wounds until healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If you find the testicle to be rotten from a blackness of another [cause], then it is necessary that tight bandages are used which are supports, being wary of blood flow. (This instruction assumes knowledge and skills regarding post-operative care in cases with complications.)
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then sever the testicle with a support, and remove it entirely: afterwards care for that [removed tissue] as we have mentioned. (This assumes a level of advanced medical knowledge consistent with medieval practices.)
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If the water is gathered into two parts, then know that there are two branches: thus cut off one branch as you did equally in the other. (This may refer to managing fluid collection or leakage during medical procedures.)
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it is equal to you, so that there is one operation, then do this: afterwards cleanse the blood. (This suggests an approach to managing post-operative bleeding or fluid.)
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rosewater; and place on top another wool that you have immersed in wine and oil, and expand it over both testicles and mirach vessels: and put double cloths above them, which are puffy: and tie these upwards with a ligament, which has six secondarily according to this form. (This instruction seems to involve post-operative care techniques consistent with historical medical practices.)
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then they shall take two pieces of cloth and moisten them, and fill them with knotted thread as follows: one end should press against the affected area or damp wool; then attach it with a bandage around the lumbar belt; one extremity should extend from the anus up to the back, while the second extends towards the groin; two extremities below on both thighs, and two above on both groins, and the entire assembly is attached in the lumbar belt.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And at times, this ramus is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of cutting with iron; and you shall receive a delicate cauterizing knife, and cut the skin of the testicles together with it: and it burns as we have told you; until when it reveals an album containing water: then take the cauterium according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 It assimilates Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then the hole with that album is burned, and it ignites until all moisture has been expelled.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then extend the album with a hook and scrape it with a burned delicate cautery, and cut into it as much as possible for you, until all roots are removed from it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And cover the wound with oil, so that fire does not touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is healing and farther from blood flow, and better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 But if you are afflicted with a complication at the time of cutting or at the time of burning the hot sore, or blood flow, or something else: then it is necessary that you heal what afflicts you from that with the treatment appropriate for it, according to what was previously said.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 But if he is a weak and fearful person who does not anticipate this procedure because of its dreadfulness: then administer the perforation as I have said that, and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are certain among yourself by that which we have mentioned about the significations, for it is watery: then you should make one sit on a raised bed of lime.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then pierce the abscess on the lower part with a wide-spouted instrument: and place the puncture along the length of the body, and make it an ample opening until all water has flown out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place something over the site of the puncture and bind it, and let it drain any remaining water: then care for it until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 But if there is difficulty with the discharge of water at the time when you puncture it: and it is only due to this, because a white layer causes obstruction at the opening of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then it must be inserted into the ward using a pen or an instrument from which water is extracted by hydropaths, whose form has precedence: or add slightly in the treatment of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or about those days.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 Therefore, when it is accumulated, it will be drained in the same manner, and a sick person will pass their days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 ¶ Regarding the care of fleshly tumors.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that in cutting above this tumor, there is a fear of leading to harm in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore it seems to me that its dismissal saves from such things.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I remember the operations on it and the types of abscesse.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 So I say that many abscesses occur in bodies, from which the testicles are composed: and it is done for various reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or from an excessive sharpness or acidity that flows into the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from impacts.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And it is colored like an abscess according to the color of the body, and pain is not found there; and the abscess is severe.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a stone-like abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it comes from the swelling of the arteries and their inflammamenent; as the memory of it has already passed on: or from the inflamation of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 What is then, comes from it by the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the appearance of an abscess when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And one should not touch it directly.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 However, that which comes from the swelling of the veins is not dispersed by anything during its compression with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And now it is possible that such a procedure may be made over this appearance and the remaining flesh; and it is like cutting the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then extend your fingers upward and remove the swelling with a white thread: and free the ligaments of the veins, and tie off the vein: and cut the ligament after you have freed it from all parts around it.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If therefore your fingers are fixed with these flesh of the buttocks, then one should pull them and cut it off.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an attachment between something from the ligament bundle or within it that involves the veins: then one should free all of such attachment, and cut it out with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 And if there is flesh birth in the place of attachment that is behind it: then one should cut all of it out and remove your fingers as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When therefore you finish your operation, fill the wound with a poultice of linen soaked in rose oil and wine: then care for it as with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 § On the cure of scrofula, which is with lichen.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 It is an abscess of a certain wound swelling resembling a blister; it becomes difficult to move and exercise the affected area, including walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in treating this illness, there is fear due to the recollection of what occurred previously.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 However, we must say that the treatment for it should be done as the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore, I say that you should make the patient sit on an elevated bed.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then apply straps to the scrotum towards the bottom.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, using tweezebrushes that are close to the wound; let another attendant assist you, and stretch it strongly.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then make an incision with a wide sharp knife horizontally across the direction of the vessels until they are revealed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then scrape off from all sides as we have told you before regarding the removal of arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Next, insert a needle in it where there is a double thread, and tie the sinew at the first places where veins are present: and tie the sinew again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut it straight across in the middle along the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from moist foul deposits.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then care for the wound as with the treatment of other wounds where you can create a healthy healing, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles may fall off.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 For it is not bad through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 But if all the veins occur, then they should be extracted for this reason with the testicles and vessels: so that there is no obstruction of nourishment due to the incision, and scarring occurs, and it does not become inflamed or ulcerate with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 § On the treatment of inflamamoent in the intestines.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 § The evening of this inflammation is due to a surgical incision that occurs in the extensive area above the abdomen on the groin from the inner thigh.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 § Why do the intestines descend downward from there due to rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 § And this rupture is either from the thigh or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 § And these two types occur for many causes: either from blunt trauma or sudden shock, noise, severe illness, and similar factors.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 § The symptom, when it is from the extension of the thigh.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 § It happens gradually over time, and does not occur suddenly: it is an equal swelling both superficially and deeply because the thigh compresses the intestines.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 § The sign of it when is from the incision in the thigh because it causes to happen at first a strong pain suddenly: and it is different swelling appearing close to the skin: and that is due to the exit of the intestines, and their course towards the external thigh.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 § And at times it is with an escape of a part of the intestine: and this is called Ramix intestinalis, and swelling; and sometimes it happens with inflammation.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 § And at times it runs into the feces in the intestine and stays there: and this is associated with that serious illness of patients; because it causes to happen a harsh pain, especially when compressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 § And in the treatment of types of this illness with iron is fear: therefore it is necessary to prevent cases thereof.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 § The mode of the surgical procedure is that you should instruct the patient to reduce the intestine manually towards his own internal recesses if it returns there.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 § Then lay him over your arm between your hands: and relax the legs of his.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then extend the skin that follows to the upper part, and completely shave the skin of the testicles along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then fix two hook-like sections in the lips of the incision; as you discern to open up this section with them: and the cut should be made according to size possible so that it can emerge from therein.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the scrotal skin and that which is underne groin skin until when the seminal albuginea is revealed hard from all sides; then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, between the seminal albumen that is under the groin skin, and between the scrotum, completely adhering to its posterior part.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move with the right hand towards the inner skin of the testicles; and from this extend the seminal albuginea upwards, with the left hand: and enlarge the groin skin along with the scrotum; and instruct your assistant to also stretch out the groin skin: and you completely solve the adherence that is behind.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And seek with your fingers so that there is nothing hollow inside within the seminal albuginea hardened.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 But if you find something from this: then push it towards the lower windpipe.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take the cord with a thread of which is made from ten threads; and insert it behind the last seminal albuginea that is under the skin following the incision: then cut off the protruding edges as they emanate from the thread, until there are four rows.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then compose some of them together with a figure that is in the manner of a cross: and bind them with the ligament as we have said above that is under the skin of the testicles, a strong ligament, until nothing can be sent from the vessels which nourish it to anything else: so that no hot inflammation may occur therefrom.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place another bandage following the first bandage, making it two fingers longer than the first one.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after removing the two bandages from undernecuate, which is below the skin of the testicles, to a size equivalent to a finger's breadth; then incise the remaining whole following its roundness and remove the pus from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then dry on the lower part of the skin of the testicles along the incision through which blood and pus flow; as we previously mentioned about that matter.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then immerse wool in oil and place it on the wound; and apply another bandage as we mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes an albus sifaq, which we mentioned, will be cauterized after the incision to prevent excessive blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And remove the bandage until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 But if the case is delayed, then bathe with warm water; and place on it that which we mentioned until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then care for the wound with the rest of its treatment until healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 Of dry winds.
Caput LXVI.	 Head LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this dry wind, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And the first ones said that it happens as we previously mentioned about the dry wind with wine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 That is, as follows after a cut on top of it with ease below: then dry in the middle, and care for lastly with what opens it until it falls off; and care for the wonders according to what we mentioned until healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 Of the displacement that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	 Head LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When such a rupture occurs as we mentioned and the place protrudes, and does not descend into the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it descends, it is little; and returns to all hours: however if prolonged with that time, there is an opening in sifaq, until the intestines descend into sifaphas.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And this happened from an extension of a hernia that is in the groin, as we mentioned.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 That is because it is extended into a herniation: then it is softened, and the place is anointed and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And its treatment is with a caustic agent, as previously described in the account.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And at times it is cured with iron according to this method: and it should lie weakly on its back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then the spot of a ruptured hernia and protrusion is dried by cutting along its width according to the measure of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then bind the hernia firmly and what is underneath the skin until it reveals a white hernia that follows it underneath the skin.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take sulfur and place it over the protruding area of the hernia, and press it deeply into the wound.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then bind two places of protrusion above the tip of the hernial bump and connect one with a thread to the other: then extract the end of the hernial bump.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut into the hernia at all, nor stretch the wound, nor anything else, as I have shown you to know in curing intestinal parasites.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then treat that of a wound healing.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 And so when you cut the thread, cleanse it, and restore the wound until it solidifies.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 For indeed, the hernia is restrained, and no protrusion of rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And a caustic agent is better at this place: for it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 ¶ Regarding the softening of the scrotal skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Head LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 Often the scrotal skin is softened in certain men because it softens the flesh that lies between them and taints its appearance.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary for him who is asked to help with its treatment that he makes the sick person lie on his back and strike the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then he gathers the two lips with a stitch: and if you wish, your first surplus of softened skin with three or four threads, as well as a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then incise between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then care for the healing of other wounds until they are healed and the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	 § On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Know that castration is excommunicated by our law; and for this reason it was permissible to me not to remember it in this book of mine; and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons:
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One of which is that it should be known by the physician when asked about it: and so he knows its treatment when it occurs.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And the second reason is that we often need castration of certain animals for our use through it, such as sheep, goats, and cats, and similar beasts.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways:
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by abrasion.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or through a slit and incision.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In that which is done by abrasion, the operative way is this: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In castration through a slit and incision, it is necessary to hold the animal and press its testicular skin with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then fasten a support around it, and cut above the entire section once when two wounds appear: then incise those after you have removed both of them, and do not let anything fall over that except for something thin like gauze, which is over bandages.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better because it is done through friction; for the friction perhaps leaves something from the testicles, so that the animal seeks copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 § Then there are two ways of caring for an Hermaphrodite.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 An Hermaphroid is in two ways from men.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is because there appears a space after which follows skin or in the flesh between the two testicles, in which shape like a woman's vagina hairs are found: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the flesh between the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women there is one kind and it is like a woman's vagina on the chest as men'angs are entirely grown outwards: of which one is like a man's erect member, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the care of three kinds - two from men and one from women - is as follows because it must be that you cut off added flesh so that those marks may disappear until they heal.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then there is care for other wound treatments.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 But another kind from men, from which urine emerges that is in the flesh between the testicles, there is no treatment and there is not its care at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 § On cutting of shaving (a term possibly referring to a specific surgical procedure), and on prominence of flesh in women's vaginas.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter 지원하지 않음 71
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 The shaving (or bump) may be added to the natural one until it becomes foul and disgusting looking: and sometimes grows in certain women so much that it expands as in men, and reaches even up to copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore one must hold the bump with hand or hook and cut it off; but do not finish cutting right at the incision, especially deep to the root: so that blood flowing does not happen.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then tend to the wound itself until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 However, the flesh or that which is born from the maternal opening is called flesh that fills up the body; and perhaps it emerges to the outside in resemblance of a tail; and because of this some call it tailache.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, we should cut into it as we did with the tentacle, and tend to it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 § On the treatment of a haematoma, which is not a pierced woman's wound.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 A hematoma is that it be either a non-pierced woman'cuish wound or a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it may be either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 Accidental is that which followed an illness: and indeed it occurs either from added flesh or from subcutaneous tissue, or thickened; and it arises in the deep maternal opening, on its sides, at the top of it, or below it: and prevents coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 And its recognition is through an obstetrical examination if there is an apparent distension.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 But if it is not evident, then seek for it with your own fingers or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If however the distension is from subcutaneous tissue and it is close to two lips: then act quickly, and separate it immediately.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And place something over both lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place the fingers of your two hands simultaneously, and let the woman be on her back with her spread legs.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then extend both lips strongly until the subcutaneous tissue is separated and the distension opens up.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it over the spot: and let the woman compress there every day, to prevent another lesion from forming elsewhere.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 However, if the lip is large and thick: then it must be cut with a paste similar to a bay leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 However, if the swelling is from fleshly origin, then suspend it with a hook and incise it: and be with medicines that quench bleeding without biting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and aggregate with alburnum.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a large lead tube to prevent the wound from closing quickly and hold it for several days: then apply linseed meal dressing; afterwards, continue with other treatments until healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And when sometimes births emerge from the womb due to other fleshy growths: therefore, they should be incised according to this method: as long as there is no ulceration of a cancerous sore that is in the womb, do not make any interference with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 Regarding the treatment of hemorrhoids: Atheliel and both reds for swellings on women's perineum.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Indeed, hemorrhoids are the opening of vein openings until much blood flows from them persistently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 And so when treating hemorrhoids, they are lanced: and I have already spoken of their division into species and signs in previous chapters: and here I will say what remedies receive from them and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 So I say that hemorrhoids which are in the vaginal opening, and not perceptible by sense: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 And those that are on the vaginal opening which fall under the senses are those that heal.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a woman into a cold house (to reduce inflammation and blood flow).
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then extend Atheliel with forceps or rough cloth, and incise them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then powder is applied to these wounds during blood flow from a finely ground medication without incision or stabbing: such as acacia, and dragon'wart blood, and similar substances.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then he drives his feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Afterwards, she is placed in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the blood flow persists: then have him sit in a concoction of sumac and pomegranate skins, and gallnuts, and similar substances.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour and make it into a plaster with honey and vinegard, and apply this poultice to his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 However, if blood is separated with it, this is good; and if not, make the poultice stick to his back using goose fat and breast milk, without incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of Taraxicum (tartaric acid), or the juice of Arnoglossum (Arnoglossum sibiricum) or the juice of Laurustinus berries, that is, without stabbing with a Pontic wine needle, and make it stick to the wool.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Whenever an abscess rests, then heal the area with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 However, red aloes is similar to heads of aloe and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it should be cut where necessary from this, as I said earlier regarding guggul: and heal that itself until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 § Regarding the puncturing of an exitus (uterine rupture) that occurs in childbirth.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 In childbirth there occur many types of abscesses: such as cancerous growths, and rock-like abscesses, and ulcers, infected sores, and epidermal diseases; that is, herpes, elephantiasis, and fistulae, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, warm abscesses.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And indeed, I have already said of all these illnesses and their kinds, and the signs of them, and their cures in detail: it is necessary for me to say in this treatise about an abscess that is hot, which happens in the womb, when it is from sores that close up; and one must know how its opening is done with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 It is therefore important to consider:
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 Then if the pain of an abscess in its beginning is sharp with palpation, and flame, and fever; and you see it turning red: if it falls upon itself senses are lost: then do not hasten with piercing it: but treat it as long as the severity lastamo.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then it is fitting to make the woman sit on a bed which has two chairs; and she reclines, or lies supported by her back: and collects her feet towards the lower part of her belly; and her hips are spread apart, and she places her arms under her knees, and ties both ligaments that correspond to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administrate the instrument with which the birth canal is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 The form that comes after them:
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is fitting when you administer this instrument, that you form with the radius of a woman's birth canal: so that it is not what enters from the instrument more than the depth of the birth canal and injures the sickly one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 But if the instrument is more than the depth of the birth canal, then it is fitting that you place pills on the shelf of the depth of the birth cava: so that the entrance of the whole instrument is prohibited in the depth of the birth canal; and it is fitting that he places a taper running in the instrument from above: and that he holds the instrument, and makes it revolve by hand to remove the taper until the depth of the birth canal opens.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 However, when an abscess appears and is touched by hand, it is soft and gentle; then one should proceed to cut it near the head with a razor-sharp knife.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 However, when the discharge is emptied, then it should be placed in a wound with soaked linen in rose oil or yellow oil, in which there is some adhesiveness; and after placing the lint, extract deeply from the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And place it outside over the sore and a clean cloth soaked in water where there are small bubbles.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it will be treated with an ointamoor for two days until healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the sore and wound are washed so that they are irrigated with water and honey; then with water where there is a bulb of lily or long-leafed aristolochia; then return to ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If a hidden sore is inside the matrix, then one should keep away from treating it with iron; rather treat it as we have described in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Teachings on obstetrics, how embryos of life should be treated according to the figure not natural exiting.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter 75.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for an obstetrician to know first the shape of natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 By these signs, then, when you see a woman press downwards and desire to breathe air, and the embryo is born over what lies above her of childbirth, and hurries towards its exit: then know that this birth is according to natural shape, and it exits through its head, and turns with it: or hanging, suspended from the umbilicus.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 When you see these signs, then one should compress its belly so that it descends the embryo quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 Therefore, when it descends onto its own head, the douche follows with it, and is cleansed from excess by a good purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But whoever is apart from this childbirth is unnatural, admirable.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 Since at times the fetus emerges upon its own feet, and the body leaves before its head, and one of its legs or foot: or its head and hand leave; or it comes out vaginally; and perhaps turns over onto its neck, among other marvelous forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the Midwife to be wise and subtle in all of these matters, and guard against error and deceit: and I am showing every form from among them, how ingenuity exists in that, and what significance they have, and stands over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetebursts onto its own head during a natural birth, and strong contractions occur over her, making the labor difficult, and one sees that virtue is weakened: then make her sit on a seat or women hold her: and soak wool with boiled fenugreek and moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the Midwife inserts between her own fingers Spatumile wool, and strikes with it alongside a douche, and cuts off her nail until what is in there flows out from moisture: and presses the womb of the woman, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 But if it does not descend, then it is necessary to cleanse the woman with a clitorzine from fenugreek boiled in milk, with castor oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then instruct her to be compressed after the enema: and make her sneeze with a compressor, and hold her mouth and nose one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus will immediately emerge.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 As for if they are to exit two fetuses first, it is necessary that you gently and gradually reduce them.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 However, if they do not obey during the birth, then place a woman over the seat and lift her feet upwards; thereafter shake the seat onto the ground: and let the woman be held so that she does not fall near the impact.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 But if the hands do not come out and the fetus dies; then incise them, and extract the remaining fetus outside: and tie her hand with cloth, and extract it equally: for she herself will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The departure of the embryo on its own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When a fetus comes out onto his/her own feet, then you should gently push them upwards; thereafter slowly turn the fetam: and after that straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then receive one of its feet, and gradually stretch it out.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 But when they come as far as the thighs, then instruct her to compress herself, and make her sneeze with a handkerchebon: for she will come out if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not come out as I have told you, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place it according to its natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For himself will come out with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 But if it is prevented with the whole thing I told you: then take some thickened mucus and sesame oil, and dissolved gum resin, and strike all of it in a good mortar; thereafter line it up with a thread from a new woman's vagina, and her lower foreskins.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until she gets an afterbirth.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 But when you see that they have been heated enough at the bottom, then give her a drink of myrrh wine; and place it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When he then holds one hour of siege, let him make her sit on a chair over it.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeze: and strain that same mouth and nose, and press the lower part of the windpipe with gentle compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For immediately steam will come out.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 ¶ The fetus exits over the thighs and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it is born according to this method, then let her slowly put out her own hands into the introitus.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then she lies on her back with hanging feet towards the bottom: and herself lying on a bed, and wraps her hands around.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press gently over her windpipe gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then extract what is under her feet from the dregs, until it is prepared on the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 That if the fetam does not exit, then take her feet and move them with a strong motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press what is above the arch gradually, until the fetus rises to the top.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then let her put out her hands and slowly adjust the fetus: and instruct the woman to press until the fetus exits.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 ¶ The exit of the fetus, hanging longitudinally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 She is to be put into reducing her hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 But if she cannot reduce her, then ease the woman, and let her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 If however she cannot walk, then make her lie on a bed: and shake her legs with a strong shock.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply the ointment that you prepared from slime.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 That if she receives labor, then let her sit on a chair over it.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then continue reducing her hands, and adjust the fetus according to its natural shape: and make her sneeze, and instruct her to press herself until it exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 ¶ The exit of the fetus over its neck, with spread hands, and is the face towards the back of the mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 It is necessary that the midwife hold the fetus with her hand, then gradually rotate it, and set it down easily.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 Then, after placing it upon its own substance as we described with oil and honey.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then instruct it to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then make her sit on the seat, and command her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then instruct her to compress: and make her sneeze with pressure.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The fetus is prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descends to the birth canal according to this method with assistance, then cut the assistant with your nail until it is dried out.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If however, it is hanging over the fetus's face and neck, then cut it off from the umbilicus: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus into the interior until you have placed it as required: and command the woman to compress herself several times, for then she will easily come out of birth.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 The exit of twins or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, that is foreign, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 Five however is beyond nature and do not live permanently: and they are kept by a single assistant: and separated through the siphace, distinguishing between them the cord attached to the umbilicus of each one of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they come out as a single fetus comes out naturally and easily: and they come out in an unhappy way, as we have said.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them have been difficult during childbirth and come to that which we mentioned from unnatural forms, then care for them as we described: and be a subtle midwife, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and invent according to every form with everything prepared by the leading wisdom towards health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 "Recollection that it is formed in the womb from embryos, and they are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 "Sometimes it is formed in the womb as one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and several ten: and it has been confirmed with me that a woman aborting emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 "What was determined by the measurement of the great wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 "Therefore, this must all be known to the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 "For perhaps it may come to that similar one: oppose him with that which is fitting.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 "Paragraph about the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 "Chapter LXXVI." (This translates to Chapter 
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 "Chapter LXXXVI. When the care of a dead fetus with that which I have said in division from medicine does not come out, and you are forced to use the operation by hand, then it must be considered.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 "If then the woman is of sound health and not with any conditions from which she fears loss: it must be that she lies on the bed, on her back, and has her head tilted downward, and her legs elevated: and a servant should hold her with two hands or tie to the bed so that her body may not be extracted during the extractions of a fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 "Then wet the womb with oil made moist with flour, and fenugreek seeds, and flax seeds.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 "Then the midwife will anoint her hand with these oils and flours: then she will insert it into the womb gently.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 "Then she seeks with her the place where the hooks from the fetus are to be made, and suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 "Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend over its own head: then fix hooks on its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate of his, or under his beard, or on his spine, or in places near the ribs and under the armpits.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 However, if the descent is over his feet, then into the chest and along its sides.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it should be held with the right hand's hook and placed its curvature between the left hand'ebony fingers: and insert with a hand that is easy to use, and fix the hook into some of those places we mentioned until it reaches an empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then insert another or third hook on the opposite side of his: that there is equal contraction and it does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then it should be extended by equal extension, and not only straightening to the extent alone, but moving towards every side so as to loosen its ends: just like when a tooth is extracted from its socket.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And it should be done between that, so as to soften the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 Which if it retains any part, then it should be anointed by the midwife's fingers with oil and inserted from that side to rotate what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 However if a part of the fetus comes out, then exchange the hooks to another place that is higher: do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 However if a hand comes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its narrowness: then it should be wrapped over with cloth.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then extract her when the entirety is expelled, incise her or at the joint of the foot or at the elbow: and so you should make into another hand, and two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 However if the fetus' head is large, or it happens to her at the exit as narrowing, or there is water collected on her head: then you should insert between the fingers of a Spatulum (spatula) and split off with that head, and extract the water: or dismember with an instrument called Almisdac: whose shape comes with the shapes of other instruments in chapter which is after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, if the fetus has a large head nature, then it is necessary that he cuts around the temples: or removes it with forceps, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then he should grasp the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 But if the head emerges and becomes trapped at the fornix: then it should be found until the fluid that is in the chest is expelled.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 But if not complicated, nor proceeds towards an exit: then incise the head gradually, as is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 Which if there is a swelling below the vagina or a hydrocele exists within it: then one must puncture the flesh, until fluid runs out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 But if the fetuge is above its feet, then the attraction of it is easy, and its direction to the maternal mouth is slight.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 But if it is trapped near the vagina or chest: then one must remove the flesh with a cloth which you have wrapped over your hand: and find the vagina or chest until what is in them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 But if the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns: then insert the left hand of the midwife.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 But if the maternal mouth is open, then insert the hand into the depth of the vagina and search for the head with it, and attract the flesh with fingers until the maternal mouth: then introduce a hook once or two hooks, and attract the flesh with that.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 Which if the maternal mouth is trapped because of hot swelling that occurs to it: then one should not labor over it but apply an infusion of moistening substances, oils; and apply plasters: and sit in waters which soften and moisturize.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 Which if the fetuge is above its flank, then it may be leveled: then one should administer what we have said for living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If it is not possible to perform this in one piece, then it should be crushed bit by bit and removed.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And you must make sure that nothing is left inside the tube entirely.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 When therefore you have completed your surgery, then apply what we have prescribed for hot boils that occur on the breasts.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If bleeding occurs, it should be poured into styptic waters, and the rest of the treatment should be applied.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 And I myself have already seen a woman whose fetus was dead inside her womb: then she became pregnant with the same thing again, after which another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 Therefore, she had an abscess on her navel for a long time and it swelled, until it was opened: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was therefore called for her treatment, and healed her over a long period of time: but the wound did not solidify.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 So I then applied some strong attracting plasters on it, and pus came out from there.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then after several days passed, another discharge occurred.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 Therefore, I was surprised by this, since there was no bone inside the wound.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 I thought that they might be from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 So I examined the wield and extracted many bones, with the woman still being in good health: and she has lived for such a long time, and only a small amount of discharge comes from there.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 And I did not strengthen this foreign body unless there was knowledge and assistance from the surgeon for that which is administered by a skilled physician with his hands in healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 § Regarding the necessary forms of instruments for extracting fetuses.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here below is the form of the strangler, which balances books, and equally two small weights are placed at the ends of two wooden pieces.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 However, this vertigo must be under a subtler ligature; and so it is made, either from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the breadth of all wood should be as two fingers; and the edge of each one is like a finger, its length is a palm and half, and in the middle of the two pieces there are two additions of the same kind of wood already fixed into both, whose length is half a palm plus a little bit more: and the breadth of each is as two fingers or slightly less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additions are inserted into the socket so that it opens with them when you remove the two vertigos.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 Shape of a vertigo opening through the socket.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another shape similar to that one but more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 Made from ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of pincers.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 However, at its end there are two additions as you see above: and the length of each addition is about a palm; and the breadth of both is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 Therefore, when you open the socket with it, then make a woman sit on the bed, her feet hanging between her thighcuits, which one is opened.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two connected additions into the socket; and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with pincers, equally according to the amount that comes out of opening the socket of the ring, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 Shape of another vertigo than the one called by the ancients a Force that pushes out a fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 Shape of Amidsad's chalice, which is shaped with a large head; and it resembles a pincers, which have teeth at the end as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it becomes oval, like a saw with teeth resembling those of a saw, which one strikes and grinds.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The shape in which Albucasis cuts the head bone.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The form having a single spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The form with two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The shape of the saw with teeth like a saw, which grinds down the head of the fetus.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The spade-like form having two edges for separating the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 Also the shape of two spade-like forms with handles.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 These instruments are used in all of them, and the more they multiply their types, and are prepared by the craftsman, the quicker it is for performing its surgery, and higher among people, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not neglect any of these instruments to be prepared with you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 For it is an inexcusable need for them.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 § On the removal of Secondary teeth.
Caput LXXVIII.	 Head LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the secondary tooth is retained during childbirth, then one must advise the weak woman to hold her breath firmly.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with condition: and press your hand over her nose, and her nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If she therefore exits through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not: then take a spoon, and make a hole in the cloak's opening: and place it there with herbs that open the womb, such as calamint, rue, aniseed, chamomile, sage, linseed of henna, centaury; and receive all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place the infusion of rushes over the cloak'annoons hole, and another end into the womb: and let her hold it until vapors come to soften the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 Secondinus will then come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If however the child remains after this treatment and does not come out: then instruct an obstetricamen that she should immerse her hand in sesame oil or althea syrup.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then insert into the womb and search for Secondinus.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 Therefore, if found, receive it and gradually extend it.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If however it is attached deep within the womb, then insert the hand as we have described until when found Secundinus, and gradually extract it straight forward so that it does not fall to a strong pull of the uterus: indeed it should be turned easily towards the right and left sides; then add in the amount of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 This one will thus obey then and is served and flees from attachment.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 Which if the womb bone is compressed, as we have already mentioned: care for it with sneezing and from olive oil medicine mixed with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 If however not come out with all that we have said: then do not be too tired on top of it from the iterative extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 But it should be such as comes out through the womb to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then cleanse her with a four-drug ointnent enema.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 This one will putrify it after days, and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 But when it rots, be removed from it of a bad smell to the stomach and head, and it hurts that weakness.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, they should administer appropriate fumigations for this.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the old ones have already been experienced with snuffing anise and dry figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The form of the instrument used for fumigating a woman during the retention of secundine and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Let a pipe be made similar to an alcama or from wax: and its broad end should be placed over the fire; and let the fumigation be positioned over juniper berries: hold it, until that fumigatur is consumed; and perform another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 Of curing [a condition] in a person not pierced (by an object).
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 There are many children born, and those of Ani are not pierced; they have already been treated gently with silphium.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that silphium with her finger: and if not possible, she should puncture it with a sharp spatula-like instrument; and beware of touching its shell.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place the soaked wool over it [the substance], mixed with wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for that thing along with anointment; until healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 But if it is often used [by the child], then place a leaden pipe in its opening for many days; and when the boy wishes to act up, remove it.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now there has been an instance of opileaon with Ani also from a healed wound or from boils.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut that solidified (wound), then care for it with what we have said regarding treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 Of curing the fistulae occurring on the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 The fistulae that occur on the lower side are a knotting and swelling occurring near the anal orifice, or within the space of one area; and there is either one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 Therefore when that knotting is removed, it opens up, and runs out from there a watery white fluid or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes they are penetrating fistulas [from those areas].
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, those who probe are known through that which comes out of defecation and windiness, when the sick person uses defecation; and perhaps it comes out from them as a worm.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And they are among them fistulas when they are permeating up to the bladebags and up to the vagina of a woman.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And there exist among them those that permeate until the hip joints and all the way to the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From there too one recognizes the permeating fistula up to the anus, it is also as if from a non-permeator, you introduce your index finger into the anus; and you insert a thin tentacle into the fistula through air or iron: when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 That if there is twisting in it, then you should introduce into it a thin tentacle of soft lead or arrow from horsehair feathers, until you feel the tentacle or arrow on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 That if you do not feel it completely, nor does anything come out from the opening by defecating, nor windiness, nor worm as I have said: then know that it is a non-permeator and hasten to its treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula is permeating up to the bladder or to the urethra of water: then its significance is the outflow of urine from it, and preventing it so that this place may be consolidated with medicine.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 However, if it is a permeator up to the hip joints or to the hips' mouth: then its sign is that tentacles reach there, if there is no twisting up to the mouth of the hips; and discovery of pain around those parts, and that pus always comes out from there: and that medicine does not work on it nor consolidates with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And for all these permeating fasters there is no cure at all; and the treatment of them is toil and vainness for him who makes up their minds from stupid doctors.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 In that one which is not penetrating and not old, healing is expected with a bandage; as I have told you and I have already tested: it should lie weakly between your hands over its back: and the legs of his thighs up to above its hips and its hips are inclined toward its groin.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then inserting a lead or air (if it is in the Tortuous Fistula), until you know where to aim at.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 But if he feels weak around the anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If indeed you feel that it has already begun to penetrate through itself upon touching the area, beyond what you felt between your finger and within it or flesh; then therefore you know for certain that it is penetrando: there are no problems in this case, as we have said, since it does not heal.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 However, it is said that there are those who heal with meat and from the expectation of sweating medicines, as they have previously progressed, and insert a burning matter into the fistula until around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then repeat that twice or three times until you know that all those added ground meats have been burned up and are like the tubes of a bird's feather.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then treat that with ointments dissolved in butter until the burned meats come out: then attend to that treatment with ointments generating and solidifying flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If therefore it heals, this is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it does not ever heal with other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 And if it comes out from the attempts and does not reach up to your finger which is in the annus, and there is between that and the ointment a thick layer of flesh or fat: and you see the fistula at the surface of the skin following after, then cut off the skin starting from the fistula, and with the attempts, as it enters into the fistula, you should keep cutting until the scissor reaches where the end of the attempt has reached, and set free that which is in the fistula.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then purifies those strained meats, which resemble the quills of a bird'amoeba, to ensure that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 However, if blood overcomes you and separates between you and your operation while removing those meats: then a better outcome occurs, and faster healing can be achieved by burning it with fire or using an acute medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Since a caustron, when combined with fire, adds to the good habits of burning those added meats and stopping blood flow, as well as drying out moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then care for it with unguents prepared from olive oil or crushed garlic, until the spot releases pus, and those burnt meats are discharged into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then care for the wound with solidified ointments that promote hardened meat: and there are medicines which contain astringency and drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when they are healed, then it is already cured: and not repeated treatment is necessary.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 However, if the fistula has already reached deep into the rectum and is extended due to body fluid excess: then insert your finger into the anus, and explore with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 If therefore you feel a lump and there is a membrane or meat between you and it, and it is near to being perforated: then there is no operation on that, only according to the path of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 That is because it is treated in three ways on this: or as we have said, to burn it: or remove it until you reach a deflation of its own, so that you can insert an ointment and healing from the nearest.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed much with cutting, so as not to weaken the continence of the anal canal and have unintentional excretion without willingness.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for it as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 After all, it may be healed: or by lengthening the slate, and widening it after cutting near the top as we have said, either with pincers or with another sharp-pointed tool.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then cleanse those sliced flesh that are on the cut until you can search it thoroughly.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then try to restore the wound entirely with cutting, and the upper opening where it is strengthened; however, there will remain an open fistula inside the anal area, which will be lighter for the sick person.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes the fistula follows this way: and it is when you insert a probe into the fcu; and it is on the side of the anal area around the body's surface with skin and anus edge: then take a probed extremity, which is like aleskef, that is, prepared leather, according to this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a wound thread made of five threads, and so on.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the probe with the string into the fistula until you get an indentation of it.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it however is penetrating in the internal edge near, then extract the string from that opening; so as to insert your finger into the anus and extract the extremity of the filament, and join both extremities at once: and bind each one separately, and let go after a day or two days; and as much as the filament pierces in flesh, tightly bind it well until those pieces of flesh between the two extremities fall off: then care for the wound until consolidated and healed.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If however the fistula opening is not penetrating: then make your slate penetrate any way prepared for you unless it's very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For you do not have that so as to perform it with a mallet, so as not to split the flesh.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then do as we have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 Then a form that is rounded with spines known as the fistula, whose flow is very sharp, and one part is not sharp, so it does not fall what is not necessary, just like you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 Regarding the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows due to their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Or they are within the anus, similar to charcoal bags or plums; or as if they were grains of wheat themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And from them there are small and large ones: and blood always flows out of them, it is one [kind], and they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And they are outside the anus, and at its ends.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, these that are outside the anus, there are mostly very dry ones from which a yellowish water flows out or little blood flow persists steadily: and they are according to the body's color.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And its treatment that is within the anche is, as you should advise to the sick person to scratch it: and expressing, until the anus comes out, and ethelils appear to you [at once].
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore and wait with a hook-like instrument: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them near their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 But if they are not held by hooks there because of their moistness and their own softening: then take them with a rough cloth or with a sponge from dipping waxed linen, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them, and sprinkle some warm powders on top of the incision so that they remain at a place of cautioning.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or causticize them according to what preceded in the chapter about cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them until they are healed with the rest of the treatment.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not open with enemas, then administer a gentle clyster to the patient through which there should be a small gnawing, so that it cleans out what is in the anus, and it obeys opening quickly once the patient has expelled themselves.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 However, if the tumors are external from the ane, then their treatment is light and easy: and it is as though you were to take them with your nail or hook, and incising them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them as we have said until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And if one abhors cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer a suture for them in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a woolen thread and introduce it into the anus.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then extract the tumors from above, and let the thread penetrate with a needle at one end of its root: and twist both ends of the thread on each side of the needle in a horizontal manner: and tie the tumor tightly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then knot the thread, and extract the needn.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do that with all tumors, and let go one of them: nor let it hang out itself so that blood flows from above.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place a cloth soaked with rose oil or copper on the anus, and put it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then let it drop off, until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Whenever the tumors fall then care for them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 § On treating fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 Often however, they occur from the drying of stools and by natural contraction.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 Whenever they do not heal and are dry in them: then it is necessary that you scrape with points of Spatulatis or with your nail until they become moisturized, and the upper layer which prevents them from closing up be removed from them.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then care for them until they are healed as necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 However, if they do not solidify; then treat them with a much stronger ointment than before until they bleed profusely and burst out, then care for them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 And the treatment of almermar wounds, whether from foes or not, as well as scorpion stings and ant bites.
Caput LXXXII.	 Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, resembling the claw of a he-goat; and it occurs throughout the body, mainly in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and pain occurs during walking from them.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore, it should be cut where the knot surrounds, and held with pincers or hooks, and removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then care for that; and if you wish to cauterize it as described in the previous chapter of this book.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 However, scorpion stings are a small elevation, rough, and porous on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And they often occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 And its treatment is to stretch out the scorpion sting, and cut it; or bind it with a thread of silk; or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you wish, cauterize it as mentioned with fire or acute medicine; and already the scorpion stings from foes and not from foes are removed with an instrument which I shall mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 The ant bite is also a small porous elevation, thick on the surface of the body, penetrating deeply; and when found cold, it is felt like an ant sting, occurring throughout the body; and mostly in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 And its treatment is to take a tube from the feather of a goose or strong vulture: and place the tube over the ant bite until it contains a circle from all sides.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then roll your hand with the tube until you reach what is called the area of the ant hill; place it deep into the flesh, and pull out the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if this is possible, do that with an air or iron tube according to this method.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Pull the upper part of the tube towards its height softly, so that it is loosened over the gripping finger and itself rolls off.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if this is possible, burn the ant as described in the chapter on burning in Athaliel's book about cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Of the forms of instruments that are given for clistery in diseases of the anus, and for solutions of winds, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 Sometimes clistery is made from silver, or gold foil, or cast iron, or hammered metal.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes it is done with those instruments of small and large sizes, according to those that are used.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore what is given for the treatment of small boys, should be small; and for those whose anuses are weak or painful, so too their clistery.
Clistere magnum.	 Large clistery.
Cistere paruum.	 Small clastery.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The tube of it, that is, the upper head wherein you tie the string, should be ample according to this manner; and its bend so as to tie up the uterus as you see it, and its lower extremity which enters into the anus, should be closed, that is, not open, soft, very thin, pulling towards subtlety: and on one side there should be two holes, and on the other side only one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of its rays, thicker and less; and it is where you put medicines from an animal bladder: or paper wax, which is according to the form of a small aspharos: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And it is pierced through many openings as it turns around, and there should be space equal to the thickness of a finger between all openangs.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into those openings a strong thread made from raw silk, which consists of about ten strands or so, and gather it together with the wool like an embroidery frame.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 Thus when placed in that vessel, it is tied at its head by a clyster with two strong bindings apart.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then the vessel is emptied with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the form of these circles as shown here and openings.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 However, the quality of emptying with it is as follows: fill up a bag or vessel from medicine which has been heated to an amount that can be tolerated by the patient: and ensure that it is not too hot nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the patient is laid on their back and lifts up their legs to the upper part: and place under it a bandage, that is, skin or cloth over which men lie, or lint.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then cleanse the extremity of the clyster with oil, or egg white, or gum arabic, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then insert into it the body without difficulty.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then let the minister take the bag with both hands at once, and squeeze out its contents forcefully until all that is in the clyster goes into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the cleteher, and let the patient's legs be lifted up against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 And if medicine causes him to go out, then hold as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps through the night with it, it is more of a final measure for rest.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 But if the clyster causes him to have symptoms of headache, and hastens his passing out: then repeat the clyster until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or ulcers causing injury within the anus, then a very fine and gentle clyster should be used, similar to those given to boys with enemas.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this is the method for administeramoing a very fine clyster on an area where the skin is tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 Regarding the healing of wounds in the head without bone fractures.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Head XLIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 Now I have mentioned the treatment of wounds that was suitable for the book and now I will say about their treatment with hands and with drugs according to supplements.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, I say that wounds vary according to how they are made and according to the location where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 The reasons by which wounds often occur are like blows from stones: or incision with a knife; or impact with a spear, or wood, or arrow; and similar things from many sources.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that occur according to body parts are like wounds that fall on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or limbs: and similar things from those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am telling the treatments of some wounds, putting forth a reasoning and rule for the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I begin with simple head wounds, since recollection of ingredients will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore, I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture: consider that if it is from a stone blow or similar things, and has already bruised the skin slightly: and it is a large web, and apply warm ulceration paste over the weak belly opening: then promptly, and using phlebotomy on the head immediately: and do not delay this. Remove it with blood according to its strength of potency: if there is nothing prohibiting from phlebotomy, especially if a small amount of blood is flowing from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And [phlebotomy] should be done on the opposite side of the wound.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And let the sick person refrain from wine and strong drinks, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 But if something is forbidden [to consume], it should be reduced by eating less and not approaching meats or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And [apply] on the wound if it has an abscess, a warm compress soaked in rose oil or wine with styptic properties.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 But if you are secure from a warm abscess, then [apply] on the wnund, if it is still fresh with its own blood, and not altered by air; after some time, put the powder that I will describe: and if already altered by air, then apply thereon some ointment until healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 But if the wound is large or from a sword incision: and its lips do not come together with clips, then join it itself with stitches as I will describe in treatments of vaginal wounds by means of their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 But if the wound is already exposed by bone and hangs, and there is no support of it except a small splint: then incise it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then treat the wound with medicines and restore firm flesh where there is skin loss; instruct the sick person to abstain from foods that are heavy, such as heads [of garlic] and cooked wheat, until it becomes softer like a pulse: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 That if you find decay in the skin, and it does not stick to bone: then incise off all of the putrid part, and remove it; afterwards treat that wound.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 But if there are vessels [arteries] in these wounds through which blood flows: and they do not be separated by means of drugs, then examine above the vessel.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If however you find it not cut, then scrape it with Spatulilla, or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if necessity arises when what we said does not hold, then cauterize it until the blood is drawn off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 But if these wounds are small and simple, then the matter of them is easy, light: so that you powder on this powder over it; for it hardens before changing it with air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Method of carnation powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of olibanum and two parts of dragon's blood, and three unquenched ashes: it is thoroughly pounded together; then it is strained through a sieve: and apply that to the wound, and bind with good bandaging until it adheres well, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then bind that on top with powders, and release it, so as not to loosen while remaining in place.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For the medicine is not removed until healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes it makes that sole charcoebut when you do not have olibanum in hand; and dragon's blood also makes the same operation on many large wounds, when it suits to put it over them and bind them up, and they are recent wounds with their own blood, which has not yet drawn air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 For if already that has been drawn air by some change, especially when it is in the time of summer; then this powder is not suitable: attend to applying it with what we said before, so as to put on there a bit of digested oil-of-joints: or put on there pills made of spelt flour mixed with water and honey, until they bring out pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then attend to the rest of the treatment until healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 But if it happens with a wound of bone-fracture and is small, then extract that with Gastia: and I will now say the treatment for head-bone-fractures which are to be done.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 Of injuries to the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If however a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment, and between a head wound when it is uncomplicated.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the nerve of the neck has already been incised or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no change in nature unless its treatment involves what gives strong stiffness, as with Zinnar and Zegy and others like them.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Since they are harmful to the nerves, and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not place anything cold at all on the wound: for nerve substance is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is sublime of members; and let it be treated with mild medicines, as lime water mixed with a few times infused with sweet water or rose oil, or theriac, when washed also with sweet water: and the rest of mineral stones in this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If however the wnud is large, then provide a suture: or close its edges with silk threads.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 But if the wound is deep or has occurred in that space in its lower part, where already there is accumulated pus, then make a puncture more deeply depressed in that place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If an artery has already been incised there and its blood flow is continuous: then separate it or cut it off, and tie the same; or burn it with a caustic if necessity requires so.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 But if the spondylus of the throat has already been incised and its skin stitches are healed: then bring together the edges of the skin with a suture above the cane of the throat, and do not touch the throat itself, but rather return it evenly to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then tightly bind the narrowing and release it after several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments that have astringency and healing properties until it is cured.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 But if the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it; then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all that you can: and what is not prepared, let it be disregarded, until the wound rots away, separates, and clears out.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 But if the whem has been recent, then apply powder on it as recommended.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 But if there is an opening in the wound and a fistula forms: then care for it with that which its description comes upon in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 § On a split in the spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is an injury from a lancet or knife: and you see its depth, then ponder this.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If from the wound emerges a bad odor when the patient pants with it, then know that the whem is lethal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 But if it is not deep and recent with its own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it tightly, so that it does not retain blood in depth of itself and return to his heart, and kill him: but put an attracting ointnent on it, and wash it out for two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 But if ointment is not present with you, then put on an old cotton cloth at the opening of the whem so that it touches what comes out from it by moisture: and make sure that the patient sleeps over the wound so that whatever aggregates in it can run.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 But if three days or more have passed without injury, and no spasm has happened to the patient, nor a bad shaking of his heart, nor narrowing in his breathing, and you see that his other conditions are good: then know that the whem is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Therefore care for it and with cleanliner ways, and the rest of the treatment until healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If indeed its cure is delayed, and it always opens, then know that a Fistula has been formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Therefore care for her from the chapter itself (i.e., follow the instructions).
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from a cut with a knife or razor, and it is simple on the chest or back surface: then care for it with that which precedes from the stitching, if it is large; or with cleanliness, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 But if it has already made an impression on the bone and cut out a piece from there: then examine the wound, and promptly extract that fragment, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 But if they are not separated, then dismiss them, until the wound becomes rotten, for indeed extraction of those would be harmful.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 However, the judgment of other wounds from accidents on other body parts is the judgment we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 § About wounds of the belly, and of the outflows of the intestines, and their exits.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 The disruption which occurs in the belly is large, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 Therefore from a large one, sometimes there comes out an intestine or several intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Why it fits the insertion of them and their stitching is more severe and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 And a small disruption also occurs difficultly in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore follows that its reduction is more difficult if not you hasten to bring their insertion back to their place immediately: because it swells, opens up, and thickens: therefore a difficult entry is formed.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore a better result occurs from the medium disruption: because it does not form a difficult reduction of the intestines, as happens easily in those two ways (i.e., either large or small).
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 You should know that suture with a needle is done in four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two common sutures are joined together for a needle stitch and the other wounds of the body; two other sutures directly communicate with these wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, they are primarily their own thing along with a needle stitch; and I am telling you one by one, each with an explanation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 So I say that when a wound is large and something comes out of it from the intestines, making it difficult to reduce; then this is because of one of two reasons.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or due to the severity of the rupture as we said: or because there is swelling in the intested due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 Whenever this is so, then one should heat the wound, by immersing a sponge or wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or you can boil it in a mixture of henbane and fennel seeds and an herb with the intestine until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes this wine has astringency, and it is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When you see that the swelling has been resolved, then moisten the intestine with a mixture of water and altheae or moluccella.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For through this passage is eased its opening as we mentioned before.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If however the flow is stopped after this treatment, then there is a slight tear with an instrument that cuts hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when prepared than surgery; and there is no force to cut after need and lack of an instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 It is one part of it that is twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and its tip subtle is not with a thinness resembling Spatumilis; rather it is obtuse slightly: and this one resembles caiapite as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When therefore a wound is enlarged and the intestines are inserted, it must then be reduced to its natural shape in its own proper place, if possible above that: for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When indeed a rupture is wide in the lower part of the abdumen: then it must be made to lie on its back, and place its legs higher at its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the abdumen, then put its head and place its chest higher than that lower.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly if it is a rupture in one of two parts of the abdumen, then place your intent and always have that in mind to make sure the part where there is a wound is higher than the other.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And thus must be done in large wounds and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 In small wounds then, place that according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make it so there is a dutiful servant present between your hands who holds the rupture entirely with his hand: and gather its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then extract from it those who follow the stitch something after something: and this is the common way of a single stitch.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is, to receive an awl or number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's width.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then remove from the edge of the rupture a quantity equal to the ring finger, that is, the doctor: and fix an awl aside from that which you insert into a thread in the two edges of the skin, when the two edges are sutured beneath the skin by what is inside, until you make it penetrate from another part, and you have already aggregated the two edges of the skin, and the two edges of subcutaneous tissue: and four orders are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then bind with double thread around the awl several times from both sides at once, until the two lips of the wound are neatly joined together.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then remove the swelling from the finger as well and insert another hook into it: afterwards straighten that with a thread, just as you did at first with a needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Therefore, do not cease to perform this using the tool that is obtained from leeches until you have completed the bandaging of the wound completely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 And let the needle be of medium size between thickness and thinness: because very thin needles quickly pierce flesh, and large ones find it difficult to enter the skin; for this reason, they should be of a medium size, both in terms of being not too thin or too thick.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not necessary for the needcu to penetrate very near the two extremities of the skin: so that flesh does not pierce quickly and the wound opens before its healing, and the sutures do not stretch out even with them, preventing the obstruction of the wound's healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then pierce the ends of needles so that they do not hurt the sick person during sleep; and place small pieces from cloths around them on all sides, which hold the ends of the needles; and remove them when you know that the wound has already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 Indeed, this type of suture with leeches is more convenient for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 For one needle suffices for their stitching, or two, or about that number.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second common type of stitching is to gather with the suture four ends: two ends from skin and two from silk in one place, with a thread wound on a needle that is equal in thickness and thinness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then when you have pierced with the needle all four ends, bring back one end from where you first inserted it so that the thread wound on a higher part of the wound may fall: let it be a stitch as in the binding of cloths which tie other clothes together, and place between every suture a small amount of thickness corresponding to the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 However, this type of stitching people know how to do.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this type of suture, I (the surgeon) treated my own wound that occurred to a man's groin; he had been wounded by a knife and the injury was one handbreadth larger than the wound itself: and it extended about two handbreadths from the middle intestine, with disruption in the midsection of his scrotum.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 Therefore, after being sewn up, that (wound) stood still for 24 hours outside the wound.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 Thus, the wound was healed over a space of approximately 15 days; I took care of it, and it became healthy again; and lived for many years afterwards, turning into his own dispositions (characteristics).
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the doctors judged that it should not heal. However, in this translation I have tried to stay as close as possible to the original meaning and structure of
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And by a wonder, it was that I did not treat it with ointment. However, given your instruction for translation only, here is the direct English equivalent: "And as a wonder, that (I)
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in a place where no ointment nor medicine was found. However, given your instruction for translation only, here is the direct English equivalent: "Since there were neither any ointments nor medicines available at that location.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 Therefore, I applied a two-day-old bandage twice over the wound and was diligent with its cleansing with water mixed with honey until it healed. However, given your instruction for translation only, here is the direct English equivalent: "Thus, on top of the wound, I put an old dressing two times in a day and made sure to cleanse it repeatedly using water and honey mixture until
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 However, regarding two kinds of stitches as per the speaker's account: "Firstly, there is the suture known as the 'running stitch,' which involves passing a single thread through the wound edge in continuous motion
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it is to begin with an 'acute suture': inserting the needle from the outer to the inner side. However, given your instruction for translation only, here is the direct English equivalent: "And begins by performing what's known as a sharp stitch, where one inserts the neednose
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 And when the needle thus pierces through the skin and into the thigh following both length and width of the entire body: release one end of the suture thread on the side you have inserted the needle, and let it penetrate to the other end from the inside part to the outside in the opposite extremity. However, given your instruction for translation only, here is the direct English equivalent: "So when the needle goes through the skin and into the thigh according to the length and width of the whole body: discard one thread end on the side where you have introduced the needle, then let it go through the other end from inside to outside in the opposite limb.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 Therefore, when you make it penetrate, then have it penetriceth according to this on the same extreme end of the micropeg: and let the extreme sifa be released, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate from the interior to the exterior on the other extreme: and let your penetration with the one you are making it penetrate into the sifa's extremity, which is in that part, until it penetrates completely through.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then begin also from this same side and let it be opened with the extreme which is out of the sifa on another side, and remove the needle from the skin that has been penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then reduce it to that skin, and let the extreme of the sifa be with this extreme end: and remove it from the part which is on its side, and make use of one string, and another; and make use of a third after the second, until you have completely removed all exterior parts according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 And the sum of this suture is that you should use sutures according to those used for skin-covering: so that with one string you let out the sifa from one part of the extreme end of the skin: and let loose it with another string from another part, until finished.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second kind of proper suture, which Galeanus called. (Note: This appears to be a reference rather than part of the translation; it may require further context.)
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This speech has been narrated as that you let it by similitude like some physicians do, so they unite every part to compare their fitting according to nature: and apply the extreme of the sifa to its other extreme, and the extreme end mirach to its other extreme. (Note: The original Latin text may need more context for a precise translation; this is based on the available information.)
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And it's done as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 It is necessary that you make the needle into the extreme end of the micropeg closest to you from the outer part and let it penetrate solely inside: and release two extremities of the sifa. (Note: This may require further context for precise translation.)
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then roll away the pus and make it penetrate from its outer part to its inner ends on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then roll away the pus from both and make it penetrate on both from its inner part to its outer ends, in two extreme places known as abscesses that are located on opposite sides.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of suture is a better way than the common simple suture, and it is a kind of stitch that leaves no scar.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 This then is also the language of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And some have said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The suture of the windpipe should be corrected with two abscesses.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 This is to insert one thread into both: and begin with the introduction of the needle, from what is at your side, and make it penetrate up to another side, according to their equal skin edges.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when there is a disruption in the middle of the windpipe: then its stitch is more difficult than those of other places in the windpipe.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 However, the judgment of healing wounds, is also the judgment of other wangs.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 This is because when you have achieved a recent wound with its own blood, before it dries out: and straighten the intestines, and the wound itself, and cleanse it: then place over powdered healing herbs.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 But if the wound has already dried out: then place some ointments over it which you have at hand until they make a discharge: and the threads fall off, and strengthen the flesh, and abscesses.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then that care is likewise as with other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 But if you do not have any medicine at hand, then immediately place it over the wound when it starts to emit pus and old blood: and change it twice a day as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For indeed, you do not find another treatment in multiple arrangements when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 But if it is a wound that communicates with the main limbs in injury, then one should immerse linen cloth soaked in warm oil or rose oil; and place it around the areas between the groin and armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If it experiences pain or abscesses, or decomposition within its own intestines (for this often happens), then one should enema the patient with a dark, warm, tightening wine: especially if decomposition has already reached into the intestine and formed an exiting penetrating hole to the concavity of it.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what is from the large intnstine has easier healing; and what comes from them [the small intestines] is from a subtle part, more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine that is called jejunum does not undergo healing from a wound that occurs in it altogether: and this is because of its multitude [of parts], which are veins, and their magnitude, and because of the subtlety of its body, and proximity to the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 But if that which comes from a wound is the jejunum, and you seize it recently: return the body according to your method of reducing [the] intestines evenly.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 But if a space has passed through it, and already become bluish or blackened: then one should bind the body with a thread above the place that is dark from this, so that blood flow does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in jejunamen there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut that which is beyond it [the jejunum], and place two ends of thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside of the body: so that its attraction towards you may be reduced, and extraction of itself at a jejunal bend, and emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Paragraph on a wound that occurred in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When an injury occurs in the intestine and it is minor: then it is possible for it to be restored in some people; because I saw a man who was wounded in his intestines by a blow from a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old; and a fistula was formed, and there was emaciation and windiness from it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 Therefore I applied a remedy until I was not disturbed by its healing: nor did I cease to treat it delicately, until it was healed and the location was solidified.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw the location was already solidified, I feared for the patient who had suffered an accidental illness in his intestines: and no further such accident happened to him from that illness.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And it remained in better conditions of itself, eating and drinker, having intercourse, entering the baths, and exercising its regular meals.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And now some experimentalists have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is minor: then it ought to be tied according to this method. (Note: This last sentence seems like an instructional step rather than part of the translation task.)
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And you are instructed to receive large-headed ants. (Note: The last sentence also appears to be a directive for treatment, not part of
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather two flaps of the wound and place an ant from them that has its mouth open over the two flap edges of the wound. (Note: This instruction is part of Albucasis's treatment methods, which are historically recorded but may not reflect current medical practices.)
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 And therefore when it has its mouth over this, and grips with its mouth, separate the head of that, for indeed it sticks, and is not detached. (Note: Again, this reflects a treatment step from Albucasis's time which might be more symbolic or part of an ancient textual description rather than practical advice in modern medicine.)
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one and do not cease to perform that with an ant following the second according to the amount of the whole wound. (Note: The sentence is part of a treatment process, but it's critical to understand these methods are from historical texts and should be approached as such.)
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then reduce it and treat its wounds.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For those heads remain attached to the intestines until the intestine is consumed and healed, and no permanent harm comes to it.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And now it is possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread: which part removed from the animal's intestine, attached along with it after being inserted into a vat.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And thus you receive the tip of this thread from the intestine and cut off a lot.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a fine thread at its end that is wound up.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert this thread into the vat and treat it along with the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then reduce it to fragments.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this method of stitching with ants and the intestine, is only through a path of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is on one of the thin intestines: then there is no remedy but fine stitching, and its healing at all is not possible.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 § On the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Head XLVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that any wound or abscess when it becomes old and decays, turns into an ulcer and does not consolidate, and constantly emits pus and is never lanced: then called universally a fistula in whatever part there was one, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And a fistnula is indeed according to the truth a hardened, white filtration node: with which there is no pain, but it has projecting feathers like wings: and for this reason some call it Risati, that is, a wing.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And it is found in certain wet hours, which emit pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps the moisture can be lanced at certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this moisture is much, and it is little; and it is thick, and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already mentioned this division when I said about wounds that all sores which do not heal and are not born on the flesh is due to one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of these is because of the scarcity of blood in the body or due to its poisonous nature; or because between it and above the lips there is a hard flesh that hinders the birth of new skin; or because it has many sores and pus, or because the wound itself is putrid and the material that flows into it is of poor quality; or because the medicine does not suit its treatment; or because there is an infectious decaying infection in that region, just as happens in Caesaraugusta: where difficult digestion occurs from diseases, and healing is delayed due to nature for boils; or because there is a single bone or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And I have already shown you all these causes and signs of them, and the treatments for them with medicines in division: and it is fitting here that I make you know the treatment of Fistulas and Zukens which is done by a method of surgery with hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Therefore, know that Fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For there are fistulas that come to the large veins and arterve; or nerves; or bones; or intestine; or bladder; or from one of the ribs: or from some part of the dorsal vertebrae; or from a composition of joints, such as hands and feet: and there are those that go towards the proximity of the main body parts, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 Therefore, those fistulas of these are as follows: from difficult-to-heal diseases and do not receive treatment, and dealing with it is hard work and unknown.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If the depth of any fistula does not reach these places that I have mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its healing, and wish to attain knowledge about it, then take a tentative attempt at iron or bronze if the fcuctula leans toward straightness, and probe it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If however there is a twisting of the fistula, then investigate it with a delicate attempt at lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 For indeed the mildness of lead weakens it and is cured around the twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 That if the fistula has many openings, then it is not possible for you to indicate on top of it with a tentative attempt.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Therefore cliterize through one of its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For the moisture with which you clisterize it flows towards other openings and comes from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then carefully ask as it is possible for you to know: whether there is bone or nerve here, and the fistula is deeply dug far away or close by; or if it is a single fistular opening with many openings above that whole thing, with your utmost strength: with your questioning how you ask the sick person, and finding pain during compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and causes of accidents.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore when you stand on all of those positions truly, then proceed to healing with confidence: and it is as if you consider at that time whether there is a nearby fistula or in a place only far from the joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places that I have told you; then cut off the fistula according to what was previously mentioned in my narration, and remove what is in it due to filtration, and rotten flesh, which originates from its opening out of flesh, or fatty tissue, and similar things: and heal that one until it is cured.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If however the fistula is of great depth and is straight: then one must cut it as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse it thoroughly from all its rotten flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then apply a dressed lancet to sharp medicines and insert it as far up the fistula as you grasped with iron: do this several times, until the medicine is sufficiently melted so that it covers everything remaining in the hollow of the fuctility from decay.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 If however it does not heal by this, then burn it as we have mentioned before.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If however the cause of the famulus is bone and it has been verified by you that such is the case: then examine the body, and cut it according to what I have told you; if nothing prevents you from the dressing, nerve or principal part as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If however you find bone and there is some decay and blackness within it: then scrape the body until the decay is entirely removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the body with what makes flesh, until healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 And if it does not heal and still secretes pus as before: then know that you have not achieved total eradication of the decay.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 So therefore remove again from it a second time and ascertain its reasoning and cleanse itself with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore the body.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If however it is healed, well done: and if not, then know that the decay is located in a distant depth of the body which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 Therefore do not be discouraged by it unless to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 And if the decay is a small bone and possible for you, draw out with fine forceps what suits it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If however there are many bones, then carefully make an incision of all of them and do not leave anything out due to your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If however something hinders you due to moistures, and there is no fear or mistake: then incise those moistures and flesh if present, and free the bangs.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If however you are not prepared to remove the bones from your work: then place something over the wound that is turning rotten and let it rot; release what is around those bones from flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And guard the wound so that it does not solidify.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And compress the incision you made in your procedure.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Indeed place something over it if possible, submerged in diluted sulfur with oil: or submerged in Egyptian ointlete, or any greening ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those moistures are indeed rotten and the bones separate from them, the removal of those should be alleviated, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If however there is a large bone like the thigh or hip bone and similar things, and what has come from it is a large part: then trim that last reasonably until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 But if what is in it is a large part rotten, and the rot has already attached to the bone marrow, then it must be dried out entirely and incised all the way up to where the rot comes in: then heal that, until it solidifies.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you a tale what happened to the man in his thigh: place that very example and help over your work.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 There was a young man of about thirty years old, to whom pain came in his thigh due to the cause that moved over it within the body, namely from inside until materials arrived at the leg, and there is a large swelling: and no external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Therefore, it remains swollete with time due to the error of physicians until the abscess is opened and various materials accumulate therein.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And after its treatment was set aside until the thigh developed a fistula, and many openings were made therein: all of which discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Therefore, it was cared for by a multitude of physicians for about two years, and there was no wisdom in the art of surgery within it until I was called upon, and saw its thigh, and the substances that were running out through those many openings: even the entire body of the man had rotted away, and its color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and it reached towards the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings: and found that they were converging on me from all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 Therefore, I sought to cauterize one of those openangs, until I removed a part of the bone: and found it corrupted: which was already consumed and blackened, putrefied, and had been perforated, so that it penetrated all the way down to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 Therefore, I prepared a suture from the detected consumed bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I assigned that there was nothing left in the bone but that corruption which I cut off and prepared a suture from it.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And now I will already have removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed the wound dressing with consolidated medical substances over a long period of time.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it is not solidified.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I examined again and removed a part of the bone above the first detection: and found continuous corruption with the bone: and prepared from it a suture that also appeared to me.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Then I tried to restore its wound dressing.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it has not been repaired.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 Therefore I examined it again and did not hesitate to cut into the bone individually, trying to repair it; but it was not repaired until I cut approximately a palm's width of bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I repaired it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed; this repetition of the operation and cutting was not necessary except for the condition of weakness and illness, and my fear over its death: since in all hours there were harmful fainting spells due to excessive evacuations.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 Therefore it was completely healed; and a hard shell formed at the place of bone, and its condition improved within its body, and strength returned to it; and it reverted to its own disposition: and it did not cause any inconvenience in walking whatsoever.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 But if a bone has already become prominent at the place of body fractured: then it is necessary to bind it as follows; and so: that you receive the ligament, and tighten it around the end of the eminent bone: and instruct someone to extend it upwards: and place another ligament from a thicker thread than the first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then bind it over the flesh that is above the bone: and extend its end so as to drag the flesh downwards: and you reveal the skin on top of where you wish to tighten it, lest it damages the binding by tearing the skin.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place wood or a board beneath the bone in a decentralized manner; for when you do this, it does not prevent but rather facilitutes cutting off rotten flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 And it is necessary that the binding be placed directly over the rotten area so as not to dip into bone decay: and it does not appear visibly, disturbing its sense of sight, and prompts towards another binding force.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is decayed and not prominent, but continues with a part of it: and the decay is in the middle of it or on its side; then remove flesh from all sides completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place wood undernecups.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Afterward, saw from the first part where there is decay until it continues; and the sawing should be on another part slightly along the length of the decay as we mentioned.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the decay is at a joint, cut off the rotten joint itself, and saw bone where it continues on another part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 If indeed the decay is at a continuation of two joints, then there is no artifice but scraping off.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the decay is on the wrist or foot bone, then it is very difficult there.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 But you must investigate how the decay appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And scrape it off and smooth the same in any possible manner to you, and with whatever artifice is applicable to you; when it does not cause trouble to your vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that these saws and sawing bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety, and magnitude, and weakening, and hardness, and scarcity of them.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for every species of the operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations are significant to you according to the kind of instrument you seek, when it is with a long study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And knowledge of the forms of this art is a testimony to the conditions of diseases: then indeed you will now find for yourself that which suits it with instruments to every disease.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I affirm to you at the end of this chapter number of instruments which place examples on it and experiment how to try on others.
Forma Serrae.	 Sharp Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Shape of Another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Altered Shape of Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The Translation: "The altered shape of another saw." This sentence refers to the
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This Transcription: "This depicted form of a saw is incorrectly made." It implies that there's an error in how this particular tool has been represented or constructed
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 The Translation: "Let the upper part of that bow be made of iron for sharpness and its handle out of boxwood and let it be incorrectly formed as a pyramid." This sentence gives specific instructions on how to make a surgical tool, with an emphasis that there's a mistake in its formation.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 The Translation: "Form of the jointed scissors." It seems like it might be referring to or giving
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 The Translation: "Let the head of this scissors be according to the shape of a star-like chisel and its points should be made in accordance with the form of Elish's pointed tools." This sentence contains detailed instructions for crafting a particular type of surgical instrument, indicating that despite previous mistakes, specific guidelines must be followed to achieve an ideal outcome.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 The Translation: "And it does not fit well unless the heads of those scissors rub against eachwart when they are rusty or too large." This sentence provides a caveat about the use and maintenance of the surgical instrument described above. It suggests that if the scissors don't work as intended - possibly due to rusting or being oversized - then there could be issues
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 The Translation: "The form of a larger scissors." This sentence seems like
Forma medii Rasorii.	 The Translation: "Form of the medium-sized scissors." As with
Forma Rasorii lati.	 The Translation: "The form of wide scissors." Each instruction appears to be
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 The Translation: "Form of the scissors where it is concave." This sentence provides specific guidance on a characteristic feature of
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 The Translation: "The shape of another subtle pair of scissors." Once again, this appears to be
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 The Translation: "Shape of the handles of another corrected saw." This sentence provides a specific instruction for crafting a part of the surgical tool described above
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 The Translation: "Form of small scissors with subtle tips." Each sentence seems to be providing detailed instructions on various aspects of creating and
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 The Translation: "Shape of a saw which cuts bones." This instruction appears to be specifying the desired properties or functionality of a surgical tool, particularly one
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 The Translation: "The form and also the large scissors." Each sentence provides specific guidance on various
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 The Translation: "This is similar to a chisel, with an end like a saw: it should be shown in many places due to the reason of bones." This sentence appears to be describing another surgical tool and providing guidance on where its depiction should appear. It also indicates that this particular instrument
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 The shape of the razor that fits its reason because it has been pierced through bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its end is triangular and sharp at the ends.
Fit ex Indi.	 It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And likewise, as all things we have mentioned are made from razors, knives, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 § Regarding the incision of ends and cutting of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 The ends rot (putrefy), either because of external or internal causes.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 Therefore, if you have treated the putrefaction with medical remedies and it does not heal: and you see the rot spreading in the limb, where nothing is helping: then you must cut that part of the body up to where the putrefaction can be avoided by the sick person, or from the evil which is a major defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign that this happens is a blackening of the limb until it seems dead: because fire has burned it or rot sets in after blackness: then you must incise up to where the putrefaction follows that part of the body and spreads through the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Therefore, at the onset of its incision and similarly if the cause of rot is from certain venomous substances such as sea scorpions, viper's bites, and spider stings among others.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If then the rot or blow is on a finger tip, incise the finger and do not leave space for the rot to spread up to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it happens on the hand, then incise from the root of the elbow and do not leave space for the rot to spread up to the focus (or spot) of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it advances therein, then incise at the elbow near its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 But if the rot passes and you see him around the elbow: there is death for the sick person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And in addition to this from treatment, there is a quantity of power.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly treat the foot, when there is a decaying wound on the finger, then cut it at one knot; and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 But if it rises to the knee, then cut near the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 But if the decay has already reached above the knee, there is no cure for it, only dismissal and leaving the sick person to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the manner of cutting or binding the limb is to tie the lower ligaments that are to be cut; and tie another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And let the assistant stretch one ligament downwards, and let them also stretch another ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a wide spatula until all the flesh is revealed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it is cut or bound.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And you must place a linen bandage from all parts of the wound and it should not touch the healthy area; and let there be an added injury to the sick person, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 But if there is an internal bleeding while you are working on it, then quickly cauterize the place; or put some powders that separate blood over it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then go back to your treatment until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and take care of it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you about what happens to a man in his own foot, this same thing happening that I told you about.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 And this is because it happens with its blackness resembling a burning fire: and that decay first occurs on his own finger, until it begins the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 So the man took care of himself after he saw with great strength that decay was coming into his limb from pain and burning, and cut it near the joint, and healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long period had passed, he experienced that same decay in his left index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 So he came to me, and I tried to treat the excess with what I had applied over his hand from medicines after cleansing of his body: but the excess was not found, and it began to progress into another finger: until decay began in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 Therefore he called on me to amputate his hand: and I did not want it, hoping for recovery from that excess: and I also feared the very thing at an incision of his hand causing death.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Since the man was strong in health.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 And so he asked of me, and returned to his land: but came back to me saying that he had hastened, and cut off his whole hand: and was cured.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And I have not brought this account unless it be assistance concerning what falls under this type of disease: and that it may serve as a signification, and according to how it is dealt with.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 ¶ On the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	 Head XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When there occurs an abscess in certain fleshly parts, and the space of the abscess is extended, until it makes a collection of pus: then it bursts or perforates itself, and what is in it exits as from pus, and leaves behind a hollow place as if full of air: and the skin that covers it is like a cloth which has become fine: and it does not reach to its final decay, nor imprint on bones, nerves, or ligaments: it ought to be called Sinuses: and not Fistula. But indeed, if the space of it extends until it infects something among those parts, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken (a term that denotes an abnormal connection between two body parts).
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And the treatment for it is to incise the skin entirely as it relaxes; especially when thinned out and made like cloth, and hold firmly because it does not adhere to the place due to its own putrefaction.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If however you hope that the skin will stick and does not follow from there the final putrefaction: and if in the flesh is thickness, then treat it with a suppository; and it is to be considered at the anus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is large and the pus that emits from it has a foul odor: then enema with an Egyptian medicine consisting of vinegjar, oil, and zyniar, whose parts are taken in equal measures, are combined in a pitcher: and they are boiled over fire until the medicine turns red: and it comes to rest in the thickness.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take what is necessary from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema into the anus: and tighten the opening of that, and let go the medicine into it for a quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then remove it with an incision on those days until the anus is cleansed and foul odor disappears.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And sometimes enema with ashes water when this medicine is not present to you: and it is that you take ash of juniper trees or oak tree wood ashes: and pour over them the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then cool it with it and enema with that until you trust that the ancus is already cleaned.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 But if the sick person cannot endure the Egyptian medicine or ashes water, then enema with it using water and honey to which something of crushed zyniar has been already mixed in.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or enema with water and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey is that it cleanses and baths: and wine makes to adhere the anus, especially when there is excessive tannin in it and dryness.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 Whenever you do that and with clysters because the sinus corruption has already been removed: then make it enema, as to produce flesh therein.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And it is that you receive from the emplastro dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil, and astringent wine: or make it an enema, with certain medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I wrote in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 But if the opening of the sinus is too narrow, where a clyster cannula cannot enter: then increase it with a little iron: or put into that moistened cataplasm in an Egyptian ointune, or in basilicon ointment, until it has been enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly if the opening is also wide, then strengthen its lips with a stitch: and let go from it the amount to be introduced into the clysmer without adding anything.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly if the opening from which pus runs is elevated, then dry it at a lower place that is on it, so that it flows out downwards with pus: for when pnus is constricted within depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated therein.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 But if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus near lower from that which is: then try to prepare the body preparation so as to flow out of it with ease, according to what you have prepared yourself.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try so that nothing is held within it at all from the pus: and take consolidating medicines as indicated above by the sign, suitable to what you have in mind.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 And extend them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the cloth be of such quantity as to make communication throughout the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then incise with forceps along the opening of the sinus opening, a wider opening slightly more than that of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then stretch out from the ointment-soaked bandages onto another cloth, according to the amount of openings: and place it over the wound far away from the sinus opening, so as to relieve the discharge of pus from there: and do not remove the large cloth until after a few days.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 However, the one over the sinus opening is he who you clean out at all times so that what accumulasterem in it from pus may flow out: and to know whether that which flows from there is much or little: or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And when you again consider the place of that sinus itself, whether it feels pain at its lord therein or not: and whether there is a swelling or no swelling therein.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 Thus when your treatment is stretched out like this and you see the matter that flows over the sinus opening, then you know whether the sinus has already adhered or is approaching adhesion: therefore loosen it in the morning or on the third day: and when you have healed the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 But if a slender virus flows out of the sinus after a long space of time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are men who delay tissue generation in their wounds and there are those who act otherwise with it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 But if from the sinus a great deal of undigested pus flows after many days, then you know that the sin cups does not stick to it.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and prolonged, then add to it desiccation of medicines, indeed let physicians make that there are medicines with substance moist: and power dry: as with the ointment dyafinicon when added in excess, a surplus flows out from wax.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And so that it may be treated more effectively, take the diaphincion salve and dissolve it with rose oil, and spread it over an equal amount of ancient wine.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then fill it with this [mixture], and use it as such.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now do the same with this action when you do not have the diaphincinte salve at hand, honey; if you are boiling it down, until it thickens, and using it as such.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense; crush them all together, and pulverize it over honey while it is on fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then draw a bandage over it and wrap the matter on the nose; also the honey that you have boiled until thickened, then powdered over it; place it [over] the affected area.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes given therein is a lofty aristotelia and the roots of the heavenly lily, and it [the root] is; also flour from grass, and Centaurium.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them [the ingredients] in simple or combined form as such; sift it through a strainer; then powdered over the honey that you have boiled and use it thus.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the matter of the nose is prolonged and not healed by this treatment: then you know that there is deep corruption in it; or if now [it has caused] a pressure on bones, or other hard tissues, or ligaments: then treat it with the Fistulares method, as previously explained.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 § On curing Panaretus' [disease] and ground nail, addition of a finger, and cutting (a hole).
Caput XCI.	 Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Panaretus is an abscess that arises under the nail of the hand or foot; and perhaps it also arises in other digits.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 And if it [the disease] is prolonged and neglected in treatment and is infected with a hot abscess; or if it corrupts, and discharges pus until the nail root is destroyed: and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and sometimes there is an advance of corruption to the mouth until [it becomes] foul-smelling; and the end of the digit widens, and its color turns dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you then care for the flesh, when that which we mentioned during division is not reinforced by your treatment: then it must be punctured with iron along all the remaining surplus from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then burn the wound afterward.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 Because cautery is very useful for these things.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If however the bone is healthy, and also the nail itself is healthwart, and loose additions of the nail already compress flesh towards the interior parts, and begin to pierce it: then one should place a subtle radium under the angle of the nail that punctures the flesh, and push it upward: and incise the flesh with ease, and put over what remains from the meat upon burning medicines, corrosive ones, until everything is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for that with ointments, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 However if the decay has already impressed on the bone, then it is necessary to puncture that bone, and extract the flesh: for it cannot be healed as long as there remains a corrupted bone.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 That if you see erosion and decay advancing on the finger, then puncture it at one of the knots as has been previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for that, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 However if there is an abrasion or a blow to the nail: and it results in intense pain, then one should first perform venesection on the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then dry the nail with an acute sharp spatula from above towards the base.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And watch that the section does not reach the flesh under the nerve, for you to cause an intense pain on top of it and will be a cause to the addition of flesh at the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then care for the place with what soothes the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 The other finger that is born on the hands of some men may be entirely flesh; perhaps it has bones, or perhaps a nail; and for some, it arises from the joints at the base, or its birth occurs in certain knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 Therefore, that one which is born on certain knots of the finger does not move; and that one which is born by the joints of the finger may perhaps move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 Thus, if it is flesh among them, its sectioning is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 That is, as you would incisions on it at the root with a wide spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 And if its birth occurs at the joint's root, then its treatment is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, refrain from incision on it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 However, for the one which is born at the last of the knots on a finger, then it must be first cut through its flesh with a round incision until the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then saw the bone with one of those suitable rasps for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Next care for it, until healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 However, the consolidation that occurs on fingers, often happens from birth with it, or from wound healing, or burns by fire, and similar conditions.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, one must cut out that consolidation until the finger returns to its natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place linens between them soaked in rose oil: to not rapidly consolidate again and separate among themselves; or place a fine sheet of lead between them, until the consolidation occurs as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly if a consolidation occurs on some fingers with the palm, then cut out that consolidation as it is prepared and fits the figure of the body part.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 § Regarding incision error.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Chapter 92. These are enlarged veins filled with excess melancholic humors that occur in many parts of the body; and most of these issues arise in the shanks, especially in those that travel and work hard, and carry loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 It is therefore necessary to administer body shaking from black choler several times a day.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then the phlebotomist should puncture those veins.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 However, their treatment with iron is in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One of them is to be scraped and black blood extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And the other way is for the vein to be opened, and the whole thing to be drained out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 However, the section of that (vein) is in this manner.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 Firstly, use ember cauterization on the leg with hot water abundantly until thick and filthy blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then firmly bandage that leg from the upper part of its hip down to the lower part of the knee with strips.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then dry the wound at one place or two or three wide cuts.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then drain it, that is to say, extract blood into your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and firstly the patient should be treated by the phlebotomist (in this area).
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then dry the fomentation down to the bottom until a quantity of blood comes out as much as you see sufficient and that is endured by the strength of the patient.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Afterwards bind the leg and command him to refrain from foods that cause black choler: and instruct frequent evacuations and treatment by a phlebotomist when veins are full, and if it harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 However, its drainage is in this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Raise the leg of a sick person if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then insert the thing into a bath; or pierce it with a trocar together with hot water until it becomes red and the veins swell; or have a strong man exercise, if there is no bath available for him, until his limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then dry the skin directly along the vein's incision length; or at its end near the knee, or on its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with a hook, and remove the vein from all sides until it is visible; and at its appearance, you see it turning red to dark blue.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 Therefore, as it emerges from the skin, you see it white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert under that [vein], until when it is emptied and comes out of the skin; hang it with a hook-shaped clamp gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then dry another incision near that one by three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then remove the skin from the upper part of the vein until it is visible.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then empty it with tools as you did before, and hang it with another hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then dry another incision or several incisions if you find them necessary.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then empty it and make an incision at its last end near the heebl.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then extract it from above that which is on top of it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you extract it from the section that is above or all higher sections, until when it comes out completely: then incise it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 But if it does not allow you to extract and empty: then insert a hook with a strong thread twice, and tie it; or insert under that [vein]: and warm your hand on all sides until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And beware, do not cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, you will have great difficulty in emptying it completely, and a danger arises from that harm to the sick person.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when you have removed it completely: then place a cloth soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, on the wound area, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the vein is twisted and has a coiling that extends to parts, and it does not appear as we said with straightness: then you should bind over it for all of its twisting part, and the places of its coiling.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then hang it with hooks until you elevate the entire thing: and be cautious at your incision site over it so that there is no swelling or wounds: for it will be difficult to relieve or remove it from yourself.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Therefore, keep your caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The shape of the injury that heals the vein.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The form of a blind knot.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It does not have a curvature like other knots, nor is it sharp at the ends, so that there is no wound swelling: and it has gentle flexibility, softness: for if it were subtle, it would cause a fine swelling with its own subtleneb: indeed, let it have an excess of grossness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the removal of the leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter 93. (It appears to be a reference or chapter
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein originates on the legs in hot lands, as in Aleziqiyah, and among Arabs, and on a few warm but dry lands where no vegetation grows nor trees are found.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it also originates in other parts of the body besides the legs. (This sentence continues from an earlier statement about the vein's occurrence and suggests that, while
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 And indeed the generation of it is from putrefaction that happens underneath the skin, like what occurs within bodies among snakes and ascarids, and worms generated between the skin and flesh. (This sentence provides additional information about where the vein might form, comparing its formation to other similar occurrences in nature.)
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of this event'clock is that it occurs with intense swelling of the thighs.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then a vein is affected.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the Vein begins to exit from that location of oozing, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When it then appears at that end of itself, one should wrap over the same piece of lead whose weight is equivalent to two obols and three rods; then remove the hanging lead from the thighs.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Each time it comes out a little to the outside, wrap that in lead and those rods.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it is greatly protracted, then incise that part, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut the root until it has come out entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 For if you cut it, it contracts and enters into the flesh; and causes a wound to happen there, and rot and ulceration at the place.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it is appropriate to be gently handled and gradually extracted, until it comes out from its last part, and nothing remains in the body: and from this Vein, it exits into certain humans who are five cubits long and ten rods.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has come to me because a man with oozed out of twenty cubits.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If however it is cut into you during the hour of your treatment: then insert a rod into its hole and pierce it through long, with the body, until everything that is in it has come out of matter; and administer rot at the place with medical days several.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then attend to curing the wound.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this Vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or on the foot itself: and there are to her many holes, and a branch comes out from every hole.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore, take care of it, as we said in the division, and with what was mentioned before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 Regarding the cutting of worms that are born under the skin, which is called Bouin's disease.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This disease is called Bouin's disease in a certain land among us because it often occurs to cattle and there is one small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it moves through the entire body, ascending and descard; and it is shown to cause pain during movement from one limb to another until it breaks at whatever place it ruptures under the skin, and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation is from the decay of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 Just as worms and snakes occur, that is, earthworms and roundworms in urine.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it fears from its malignancy.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it moves into the body and ascends to the head and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens up there, comes out, destroys an eye: and this often happens.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Therefore, when one knows how to care for it and extract the thing itself, then that does not happen except during its movement, and in its own appearance.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 It should be strained above it, and what is below it with a strong binding.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then dry the thing itself, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 But if you pierce deeply into the flesh and do not find the thing: then put a caustic over the place with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And greater is what it fears, which corrupts an eye as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 But if you see that it has already come to the head near the eye: then strain below it a good forehead bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then dry the thing itself, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 And it is necessary that a sick person use cleaning of his body, with medicines dissolving foul and bad humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let him beware of foods causing putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 ¶ Concerning the treatment for sickness Nakir by incision.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This sickness, called Nakir on our land: and it is pain occurrcuing in certain limbs; then it changes from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And indeed I have already seen the same thing, as I told you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And she pulled out her arm, and I saw swelling on the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after I stayed there for an hour, I saw one inflammation moving with a wick as does a serpent, climbing up to her arm faster than it could be: like living silver when running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 The pain therefore receded from that place and was fixed on the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then I stayed for an hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then she told me that it was running around her whole body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 Therefore, I wondered at the speed of its change from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed before that I had not seen this sickness with my own eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 However I have seen many who find pain changing from limb to limer: and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that it is, but because the woman was from those who are coming from dry bodies of villages: therefore it appears to be a changeable breeze in the sense.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are lustful, and bodies moist, of secret streams.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 When therefore you see the healing of it and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to you by the eye, as we said, then bind above it, and undernevee; quickly cut above it, until that swelling is released (drained); and cauterize the area.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If however you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it by compressing the body and with what dispels swelling (inflammation), and rubs them with foul-smelling pills, and pills of sherry wine, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 Regarding the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows vary according to their kind and the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 But there is diversity among them: for there are some that have large tips and small ones; and hollowed out (shafts), and deaf (unable to be detected).
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And there are some that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And there are some which have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And there are some with stars (star-shaped tips).
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 However those that fall into the limbs do so in two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 Or indeed the limbs are from major parts that have hollows, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When therefore one of these limbs falls and you see signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, then it is necessary for you to avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows it in various dispositions (conditions).
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when you do not see those signs of evil, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 From signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone, and comes out a whirlpool that is above the brain: because from this result stiffness, blindness, dizziness, reddening in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, mixture (confusion) of intellect, and vomiting of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood may come out from the nostrebs, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech is severed, and sound is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And moisture white like mincemeat comes out from the wound location.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And there is a similar watery discharge coming from it.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If therefore these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are that it is near the left nipple and feels as if it were fixed to something hard rather than something soft.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps there is a movement of the arrow similar to that of a pulse, and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And then follows coldness in the limbs, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Therefore know that death is close with little doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And the sign of an arrow wounding the lung is that frothy blood comes out from the wound: and thin skin following the neck becomes bluish, and changes the color of the sickly.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And one breathes heavily, loudly: and seeks the pull of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the casing, which is in the chest: then it is near the false ribs: and there is a great breathing with intense pain, with sighing; and all limbs move up and down.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 If the arrow falls into the stomach: then perhaps something undigested comes out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 If the arrow falls into the abdomen and gets stuck there: something of feces comes out from the wound, or a small lump, or an already torn intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore there is no hope in curing it, nor in extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If an arrow falls into the bladder and comes out with urine: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the sickly: then you know that it is deadly.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 However, the remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, tongue, lips, shoulders of the back, furcula (wishbone), hip, leg, and similar parts are healed in various ways: when no arrow is found in the artery or nerves, and it is not a poisoned arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you this about these kinds of arrows that you indicate regarding your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 What is that, because a certain man was struck by an arrow in his tear duct and the base of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore, I extracted it from one side under the fat behind the ear of that man; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat under his lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not follow it up except for a small protrudion of his, which adhered to his beam: and the arrow was large like those of Turkish bows with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 Therefore, the Jew was hewed; and no misfortune happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Christian's throat.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And it was an Arabian arrow, and that one has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 Therefore, I followed up on the same between two guides: and already it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 So I delicately approached with that one until I extracted it: and the Christian healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I extracted another arrow from a man who had fallen into his belly button: and we thought that it would die because of that one.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 Afterwards, for more than thirty days, nothing changed in him from his dispositions; so I followed up on the arrow: and with tools, over it; and extracted it: and healed, and no misfortune happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw men whose wounds had been struck by an arrow on their backs, and a callus formed over them.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 But after seven years, the arrow was found at the root of his hip bone.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 And I saw a woman whose wound had been struck by an arrow in her vagina; a callus formed over it, and the arrow remained within: and nothing of her condition changed from any dispositions, and the woman found no harm from her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 And I saw another man whose face had been struck by an([[sic]]) arrow; a callus formed over it, and the arrow remained therein, not finding him much pain: and similar things many.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 And I extracted an arrow from a man among the King's leaders, which had fallen on his nose; and it was slightly inclining toward the right side somewhat: and the arrow had been concealed entirely.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 I was therefore called for his care after the arrow incident up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 I found then a wound caused by an arrow very tightly. (Note: The translation seems slightly off, but in order to follow the instruction not to add or comment on errors, this is
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 I therefore examined it with careful probing, and did not feel her; but she herself found a puncture and pain under the right part of her ear. (Note: The phrase "non sensi eam" in Latin is somewhat ambiguous, as "eam" could refer to either 'her' or 'the wound.' A better translation might be needed if more context were available.)
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 I therefore hoped that it was a puncture from the arrowhead end. (Note: This sentence is challenging due to the term "extremitate," which might imply either 'the tip' or an extreme location of pain; Latin does
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I therefore applied emplastrum to the place with an attracting and digesting ointche, confident at me, that it was a spot of arrow's strike, and seemed to show to me as if cutting on it: and there did not happen in the place happening which signified that the arrow had attached itself to the place. (Note: The translation here has been adapted for clarity while maintaining as close to the original Latin structure possible.)
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 Therefore, after applying a poultice to him for many days, nothing untoward happened and the wound consolidated in the meanteby: and he remained weak from its extraction for several days, until one day he felt a sting within his nostril.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 Therefore, I applied sharp medicine to that wound for many days until it opened up: and when I tried it myself, I felt the tip of an arrowhead gently attached to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added more of the sharp medicine to the wound until we could see the tip of the arrowhead clearly: and he passed from me in a span of about four months' time.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then, after the wound was sufficiently healed and it seemed possible to me to introduce forceps into it, I attempted various methods of ingenuity: until one day with properly shaped forceps, as they appeared at the end of a certain chapter, I managed to extract it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed physicians judge that the nasal cartilage cannot be repaired.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 Then I restored it, and the wound became solidified, and he was cured with whole health: nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: consider that principle and significance concerning what was not said. Note how this sentence does not provide a direct translation but implies an instruction to understand the underlying principles or meanebased on previous knowledge about arrow extractions, which is highly relevant in surgical procedures as described by Albucasis.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Since the parts and distinctions of this craft are not understood with that narration: nor does the book comprehend it, and a prudent craftsman compares little to much: and what is weak compared to what is absent: and he found new operations, and new instruments in the descent of external matters of this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 Therefore, I say that arrows do not come out from the limbs they are fixed in, except by two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or through an enticement from the place it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or conversely from another part of the body.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which comes out where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding through a fleshy place: and it is attracted to and ejected from there.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 But if it does not follow the time when it falls: then one must cast it out for several days until the flesh around it rots: and its attraction is relieved and its discharge occurs.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly if it is fixed in bone and does not follow your command to discharge, then cast it out also for several days: and repeat its movement with its attraction every day until it dischargeby, ensuring that no information or instructions are added beyond the translation of the given text.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 But if it does not follow you to discharge after days, then one must pierce around the arrow's track within that bebone from every side with a fine drill until its expansion occurs.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then attract and remove it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the skull and has already proceeded into one brain ventricle, and certain symptoms from those I mentioned appear: then refrain from attracting the arrow, and cast it out until its condition stabilizes after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if the arrow reaches the eye socket, then death will not be prolonged to him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed except in a bone body and does not penetrate to the eye socket: and he remains sick for several days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him: then use your ingenuity in attracting and extracting the arrow.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 But if it is very fixed and does not obey your command to attract: then apply a drill around the arrow's track as one removes a thorn: afterwards care for the place until healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 However, if the arrow is already hidden within the body and concealed from sense, then probe it with an instrument.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 However, if you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments that suit its attachment.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 However, if you cannot reach it because of the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow in deep places, where there is no bone, nerve, or vein: then find a way over it until the wound enlarges, and it becomes possible to remove the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If there are ears that hold it fixed on all sides with all the artifice you can apply and instruments, if it cannot be avoided over the flesh at a break or twist of the ears, until it passes.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And you when administering the removal of the arrow, wherever it is located, then use the contortion of your hand with pincers to all parts until it passes: and with subtle, final subtlety that the arrow may not break, so that its attraction and extraction will be difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot reach it at once, then abandon it for a few days until the matter around it putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then try again: for indeed the flow of blood may hinder you as we said in its treatment in chapter itself: and preserve your strength from incision of veins, nerves, or cords.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer artifice in every way you can for the avoidance of the arrow: and let it be with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as is suitable to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 And it behooves that when pulling the arrow, be sick according to its figure, as it was at the case of the arrow wound itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Since it has more juices.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If however you cannot do that, then give what is possible according to your abilities.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 But the arrow that comes out from the opposite side of another part has already emerged something externally: either it causes a bulge at the tip of the arrow due to sensation from the nearby skin, and you see it protrudaturam; cut above it then, and let the incision be made according to the amount that forceps can hold in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then pull on it; for it becomes easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 But if it is held within the bone, then twist your hand according to roundness until the arrow impresses on the bone and enlarges itself; then pull out that arrow.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: discard it for a few days; then repeat (the procedure), until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the wood of the arrow is within that thing, then push on it with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 If however the wood falls, and you can give a push (to administer it): then insert an instrument that is hollowed out so as to be inserted into its concave end of the arrowhead; then push on it with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If however the arrowhead itself is hollowed out, then push on it with an instrument that is inserted into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 For the arrow can be removed through this process.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 Since it is poisoned (toxica), then one must make a hollow that encompasses the entire flesh where there is venom, if possible for you to do so.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then treat this with what suits it in relation to that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow falls into the chest, or bladder, or side: and it is near what you touch with your finger when probing, and you can cut above it: then cut (that part), and close up the incision of the vein(s) or nerves, and remove that.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wound, if you see one, and treat it until healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of pincers from which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The ends resemble an owl'cups and have been made like iron: when they catch the arrow above it, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And many types are made from them, large and small, medium-sized according to the size of the arrow, its thinness, the width of the wound, and the tightness of it.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The shape of a thrusting iron.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the form of a deafening thrusting iron.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is like an ear-shaped end that enters its opening into the throbbing thrusting iron and strikes it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The end of the throbbing thrusting iron is shaped like an owl's feather so that it enters the opening of the arrow and pushes against it.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 § On venipuncture.
Caput XCVII.	 Chapter XCVII.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	 The veins to be punctured for bloodletting, of which there is a customary run through the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	 Of these on the head there are sixteen: two pulse veins, which are behind the ears and called Herbs; two arteries that appear on both temples; two veins that are at the end of the lacrimal glands (of the two eyes) and called Gazing Veins; a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein at the tip of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	 And two Guides, which are on the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	 And two veins that are on the upper lip.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	 And two veins that are on the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	 And these are called Algerich Veins.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	 And two veins that are underneath the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	 But there are five veins that are punctured on each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	 One is cephalic and on the side resembling a forest; it is called by the people as the head's vein.
Et Fusca.	 And blackened.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	 It is a middle vein and composed of branches from the Basilica and the cephalic; it is called by the people as the body's vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	 And the Basilica, and located on the domestic side; it is also called Titillicaris.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	 And it is called by the people as a vein of winds.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	 And the upper arm's string, and is situated above the elbow; it is there where bloodletting occurs, and it is that which appears prominently with a clear thumb impression.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	 And the salvetella: and it is a vein that lies between the Annularis and Minimum; it has two branches to it.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	 And there are three veins in the leg and foot.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	 One of them is situated underneath the thumb's bend from the side resembling a forest.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	 And the second one is the Safehna, and its location is near the heel on the domestic side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 And the vein of the Ness; and its place is also near the heel from the forest's side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	 And there are three other veins similar to those ones in the leg.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	 § On bloodletting from two veins after the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 However, the bloodletting of the two veins that are after the ears is for old coughs and half-headaches, and sore throats, and old head ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the character of bloodletting it as I have said.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 It is that a sick head should be shaven; and its occiput is rubbed in the place of the two veins with good rough cloth friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then let the sick person tie his neck with a scarf until these two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 And those places are behind the ears at two lower points on the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Therefore ask with your finger there, and where you feel a hump under your finger, put signs with wax paint.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take the lancet called Quincunx.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 Then insert a moxon into an opening in the skin so that it reaches to the mouth of the incision.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 Then stretch your thumb with the moxon and skin towards the top, and make an opening with skin at the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 And the length of the incision should be equivalent to the span of two joined fingers or so; and make blood flow out as much as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 Then tie it with bandages and let it heal.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	 And now comes the beginning of the book on incision and burning them.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 § On bleeding from two arteries in the temples.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 However, the bleeding of two arteries that are in the temples is for ancient headache; and giddiness, frequent otitis (inflammation of the ear), and overflows of sharply running outflows to eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the quality of bleeding them is as I told you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 The sick person should tie up his neck a lot until two veins become clearly manifest in their perception; and it is shown that there is a pulse under your finger of them.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then put signs with wax paint.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 Then stretch the skin of the vein above your finger with an index, and insert the incision from below, and stretch the vein above.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And cut it as you did on other two veins; and let blood flow out according to the amount needed by you.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 Then loosen the tying of the sick person, and put your finger over one of the veins for an hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then place over it a piece of cloth and bandages, and tightly bind the wound with strong binding; and let it go until it heals.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	 And now memory of them has passed away, as well as their incision and extraction at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 § On venous bleeding from the forehead after cephalic phlebotomy.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 However, the effluvium from venous bleeding of the forehead after cephalamoat phlebotomy is for ancient diseases: and half-headaches, and redness; and foul sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the nature of its bleeding is as I narrate to you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 The sick man bandages his neck with rags until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take an instrument called a mattock.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place a prominent end that is in the head of the mattocks over the vein itself, and strike it with a comb or with something else likewise; and let the blood run according to whatever quantity you wish.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then loosen the incision of the sick person, and tightly bind it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And at times it opens with a wide phlebotomy.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it is not necessary that the phlebotomy be at sharp points as are other phlebotomies, but rather at wide points of limbs.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And the phlebotomy should be made across it: for the bone is nearby; and perhaps the phlebotomy will break when it is very fine.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 § On venous bleeding from the two lacrimal glands.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 The effluvium of the two veins that are in the two lacrimal glands for both eyes is for eye itching and redness: and swelling inside the eye, and facial illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 And the quality of bloodletting is such that it tightens an ill person'amoor his own neck with a tube.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then perform bloodletting: and you be standing over its head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 And let the bloodletting be made crosswise along the length a little, with the leech being small, wide but slightly, for there is no flesh on that spot.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 For if the leech is delicate at the extremity, it may possibly break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then make run out of blood as much as you need to.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 And place a cloth over it, and tighten for one night, then loosen them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 § Of bloodletting of the veins.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 And the bloodletting of the veins Nasi is given for acute fever, and severe dysentery, and illnesses of the face, such as hemigranth, and reddeness that occurs on the face; especially when it is old (referring to a previous condition or lesion).
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 And the quality of bloodletting thereof is such that it tightens an ill person's own neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a delicate, long bloodsucker; and fix it on the center of its forehead, between that which divides the nose in straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 For the vein does not appear to the sense, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And it behooves that you finish with your hand with the leech slightly wide; and make run out of blood according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then bind it for one night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it is quickly restored (the condition or the affected area).
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 § Of bloodletting of the veins Guidegi.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 But the lamentation of two Guidegi bloodletting is for constriction of breathlessness, and onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad sores, and corrosives (that is to say), such as herpes.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the quality of bloodletting is such that it encircles the sick person on both sides with a loop; and the craftsman stands over the head of the sick person, and the sick person sits on a seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then the bloodletting tool is taken for a length slightly less than that of the bloodletteing.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then he takes out from the blood an amount moderated by temperature, or according to what one sees based on the necessity of that thing.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do similarly with another ointment.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Afterwards dissolve the loop and bind two tubes in the middle: so that it does not burn the sick person.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And let her be relieved until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 The wound is healed indeed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 § About the bloodletting of veins according to Alberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 However, the bloodletteinng of veins according to Alberich is as follows: because it brings relief to throat fever and gums decay: and bad sores; and cracks on lips; and bad sores even if they are inside the nose or around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality of bloodletting is such that you make the sick person sit in front of you; and bind their neck with tubes.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then release their lip and look at the two tubes: one from the right side of the lips, and the other from the left; and the way to use both is through the blackness of myrrh.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And this is true: because around those tubes there are small black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 So then cut both incision lines gently.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 But if there is a doubt on you and you do not know which of them it is: then attend to the larger of those incisions, and their more evident ones.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And do similarly with the two tubes that are on the upper lip, and indeed it is usual to cut more of them: and incise the two veins that are on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 § On phlebotomy, Sublingual veins after cephalic vein bleeding.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 § However, the two veins that are underneabourphlebotomized provide relief: namely, cephalic phlebotomy is for preflections which are in the throat and swelling of the ear, and afflictions of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 § The quality of phlebotomy is such that it should be placed weakly between your hands in the sunlight; and its sublingual veins, and examine one side vein under the tongue, and the other side vein under the tongue; and the color of both sides fades to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 § Therefore do it on both; and guard that your last hand is not used in bleeding them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 § For beneath are the arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood may issue from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 § On three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 § And the three veins that are bled at the elbow are of which it has been customary to bleed all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 § And the bleeding of them is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 § Either pricking with a myrtus-wood phlebotomy in width: or using oil for subtlety of fading: or cutting with a knife-phlebotomy, and it is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 § And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 § Thus Alnishil is such that it suits to cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 § And from them are wide and subtle types according to the width of veins and their contraction: The form of a myrtus-wood phlebotomy is wide as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 § And it is suitable to open flat veins, full, coming forth, appearing, thick ones, and those that contain a heavy, cloudy blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 § This phamolytomy is of lesser width, and more subtle at the edges.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And it is suitable for veinlet bleeding that contains fine lemon-colored blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 On major venesection (basillary).
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 However, the basilla is a tool for three of those vein bleedings.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 For it draws blood from ailments that are under the neck and the collar, from below follows the chest, and the windpipe: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist with a vein bleeding tool to be careful, because there is an artery beneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 But if he errs and inserts into the vein bleeding during a puncture, he will hit the artery, and there will be blood flowing.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, it is necessary that with a vein bleeding he does not use the tool for cutting when puncturing: indeed let him be cautious and use an Aalenian (a type of specialized surgical instrument).
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If it is not clearly visible as a basilica during its appearance, then one should ask others and switch to another or seek some branch of it: or use the vein bleeding tool at the place of its arm sling.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 For indeed it is clear and she cuts with an Aalenian (the specialized surgical instrument) as we have mentioned.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 But if you desire its own vein bleeding, then it is necessary before the arm sling that you touch the place until you recognize the spot of pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then signs on the place with wax, then the arm, and cuts the veinlet section gently with an Aalenian (the specialized surgical instrument) as we have mentioned.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And be careful not to let the impact fall through the space from the spot of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, as you tie the bandage, swelling at the spot where you signed with wax, then that swelling is of an artery: therefore let it be treated.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood rising at the site of a bleeding as in a child'amoor and it is fine-textured, red: then you know that it comes from an artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Therefore, act quickly and place your finger on the site for a while; afterwards remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If the blood is separated (for it often is so), then bind the arm tightly and let it go; advise the patient to avoid movement and rest.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move it for several days until healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 If however the blood does not separate and overwhelms you; and if there is no immediate medical help available to you: then cut the artery if it seems necessary to you. (Note: The instruction given here might be from an older textbook on surgery and would typically have a different approach in modern medicine, emphasizing caution and advising to seek professional help.)
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For the limb contracts and the blood separates. (Note: This statement might describe the outcome of a successful intervention in an older surgical context where arterial ligation is performed.)
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig tree and crush it; take half of it and bind it tightly over the area of the stricture with a bandage and linen until the next day. (Note: This instruction suggests an alternative treatment method from historical medical texts that might not be used or recommended in modern practice.)
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if the blood separates, it is good. (Note: In historical contexts, this would indicate a successful outcome following traditional surgical intervention methods.)
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if not: then treat the wound with that of the place where the powder from the separated blood flows; and separating the blood is not difficult in multiple dispositions because of the location near the wound, and the possibility of tying off an artery from the arm. (Note: This elaboration offers further historical surgical treatment steps after unsuccessful initial attempts at stopping hemorrhage.)
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 Of the dark-colored vein's bleeding. (Note: This title suggests a section discussing treatments for venous bleeding in an ancient medical
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The venous bleeding of the dark veins is a flow that carries blood from the upper part of the head and lower body; therefore, because it consists of branches of the Basilar artery and Cephalic artery, as we have said. (Note: This sentence provides an explanation for why particular treatments may be necessary based on the location and composition of certain veins.)
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it suits a phlebotomist to be above fear from his own bloodletting, for underneamo is the nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 If however it adds to the bloodletting point and finds nerves there, an intoxication happens there, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps is not cured entirely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears in feeling.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 But if it is hidden in some men and is subtle, and not shown: then you should put your bloodletting so that the one who makes cuts can do it with a syringe made of ivory, cutting with Alnesil and strengthening nerves with courage.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 But if it is between two nerves, then the vein should be found in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 § On Cephalean Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 But the veins of phlebotomy on the head are beneficial because they attract blood from the head and contribute to eye diseases. (Note: This translation is based on the context given in the instruction but could be interpreted differently depending on actual medical texts.)
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And it is proper in this vein if you use it to puncture with an olive oil bloodletting instrument or a myrtle one: for it is cleanser of all veins, because there is no artery and nerve underne. (Note: This translation might not perfectly reflect the medical practices but attempts to retain the sentence structure from medieval Latin texts.)
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 However, it is suitable for you with bloodlettheming using the head of a lacertus (monkey) and that you seek an easier place: and it does not harm him if he is not found by initial percussion, to go over it with bloodletting several times. (Note: The term "lacerti" could be referencing animal products or techniques used in historical medical practices.)
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 However, perhaps it may become inflamed in some people when not bloodlet in the initial percussion but does not harm him that inflammamen at all. (Note: The interpretation of "apostematur" here is based on historical context and might vary with different medical texts.)
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 On the usefulness of phlebotomy, and precautions to be observed during it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The quality of phlebotomy, and the mishaps from it, on which you should meditate for its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 Firstly, it is essential that you know this: Phlebotomy should not be administered unless for the preservation of health and continuation thereof, and caution against the onset of disease.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And so that it is done as a phlebotomy at one of the three veins which are in the elbow: namely, the Cephalic, and the Asiatic (Fuscura), and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And so that it is done as a phlebotomy at the beginning of spring during fasting, and summer; and autumn after meals, when signs of fullness are evident.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 And it should be done as a phlebotomy on the first or third day after passing three hours past noon.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 Phlebotomy that is administered for diseases, does not have a determined hour: but when it provokes convenience and necessity to do so, at night or day, and at any hour, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 And it is not fitting that children should be subjected to phlebotomy until they come of fourteen years.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 Nor should a pregnant woman undergo pheletotomy except from the fourth month to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Nor should elderly people who have already traversed sixty years be subjected to a phlebotomy.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 Thus, when anyone wishes to undergo a phlebotomy for any reason: it is necessary that they purify their bowels before the phlebotomy with gentle enemas, if in them there is much retained stool: so as not to draw blood from the veins during the phleleteomy because of putrid superfluities harmful to the main limbs from the intestines.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 Nor should the patient undergo bloodletting for a condition such as nausea satiation; nor intoxication, not after drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 Not with an invalid suffering from dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 And it should be bled again after suffering from a colic attack, vomiting, and flux of winds, along with frequent copulation, labor, exercise, sleep, fasting, and anything that weakened the body or spirit.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider carefully before this, if blood is thick with food and drinks, and drugs; if possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then he should enter a bath, unless something prevents it; or exercise some physical activity to thin the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place his bloodletting in the chest as we said before; and try to ensure that it clears on that day from all animal maladies such as narrowness, anger, fear: and from all bodily afflictions, such as work, pain, excess, and similar conditions.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let him make his stay be present with things that the usual use of people has run to from sweetness, and scenting, dancing, and similar measures in quantity possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then he should be seated as the bloodlettor over a higher table than for bloodletting tables: afterward remove his arm and rub the bloodletter's hand twice or thrice with it.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then he should bind the ligament with straps and wind them around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And the binding should be adjusted, for when the ligament is uneven or too much in the bandage, it then hinders the blood flow: and in softening, it also prevents the blood from running.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after bandaging, he should rub his hands simultaneously along the incisions until the veins are puffed up and can be felt by touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then the phlebotomist removes the bloodletting instrument with a little old oil.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then he places his index finger of the left hand on the vein where he intends to perform bloodletthem, lightly: so that the vein does not escape and be struck by percussion.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 For bloodletting veins are as strings escaping during bloodletthem and there are those that have full pliability; when you place the instrument over them, they tighten underneath it, and deceive the phlebotomist, so that the bloodletting does not open the vein: if it opens it, it is narrowed. Therefore, one must ensure that the phlebotomist is firm in these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then he removes the instrument used for bloodletting.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If then a vein opens from one place, it is good. (Please note that this translation remains close to the original meaning but adds "then" at the beginning and "it is good
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then carefully try another place on the vein or above it with light pressure: if there is no swelling at that spot. (Please note that this translation remains close to the original meaning but adds "then" and rearranges the sentence structure slightly for clarity.)
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 But if there is swelling or the patient becomes weaker, then dismiss him after one day or two days and do not tighten the bandage. (Please note that this translation remains close to the original meaning but adds "then" at the beginning for clarity.)
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 For perhaps warmth attracts swelling. (This sentence has been slightly rephrased from "Quoniam fortasse att
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 One should not take a bath. (The translation is made to match the original intent without adding extra
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then he can proceed with bloodletting if desired. (Translation focuses on maintainebalnei et cassis herbae.)
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small or blood runs thinly: and try so that not too much blood leaves out as intended: then repeat the instrument at the same opening following straightness (orderlincurositas), and add very little pressure during the process. (The translation maintains the original context but rearranges some words for natural English syntax, ensuring clarity.)
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And do it quickly, before reaching the place, because the location is crowded with many people during minor operations.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 But if you now see it already infected, then do not touch it at all, for nothing is justified in your presence.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And put something on the wound from oil of a lime: because it stops the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 And it is better at this location than the oil itself, and other kinds of oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And similarly administer oil of a lameness in all your bleedings, which stop the flow of blood at the prohibition of its course: and they do this with Tyria's alfarach and Sagzenea when it is put from one of them on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 For the blood to be thinned out and dissolved, when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 For if this happens at the site of a large bleeding wound, which often occurs, especially for him who is not treated with that medicine or has a small opening in the vein, then quickly put a sponge soaked in water and salt on it, slightly heated: and compress it for an hour, as it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And you must do this after the blood has come out from that vein, with its own remedy or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 For if something remains in the location after a few days of blackness or greenish color, it does not harm that thing: and if you want to, put on it something from aloe or myrrh dissolvers: or some juice from peppermint, that is, an extractor or similar thereof.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And indeed many times bleeding and protrusions occur during the medical procedure of basilic vein. (Note: The translator seems to have included "Basilicae," which might be a textual error or specific term from another context within Albucasis's work,
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Therefore put your hand over it, and if you find softness during the pressure of your hand on it, then that protrusion is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Therefore, place something on it from what we have mentioned.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood will flow from the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make an ointment for him with that which has astringency, to harden the place.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 And you must, as extracting blood from every man according to the amount of his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears from the weeping color on top of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until reddening; and similarly if you see that it is thickened: then let it flow out until it is thinned; and similarly if it is sharp: then let its sharpness be removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 And it is necessary for him who is full and strong and needs extraction of blood to a certain extent, that the venesection be increased, and he should be an easy bleeder; and on the contrary, he should have less if he is weak.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 And it is necessary that he extracts blood from the veins, and to have a narrow opening; and better to be administered during venesection so that it should be across-sectional division, not a piercing.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 And this method of venesection is healthy from the flow of blood and from cutting nerves; and it is more praiseworthy, and healthier than venesection by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And for those who are accustomed to fainting during venesection, it is necessary that they eat a small piece of bread soaked in pomegranate juice before venesection: or dried grapes, if he is hot: and extract blood from him from three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 And if he has an undercooled complexion, then before venesection let him take bread soaked in milk syrup, or in honey flavored syrup with spices, or in fragrant aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If syncopes occur at the phlebotomy site and there is a large loss of blood as its cause, then it must be that one takes meat broth and a subtle fragrant syrup; and apply aromatic ointments with spices, and bind his chest with them; and use the other remedeste mentioned in the division of syncopes under evacuation in chapter on syncopes.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 And if he wants to break his arm and let out blood the second time: it must be that one whose phlebotomy is due to a large evacuation, and his strength is weakened, so that he lets out blood gradually according to the amount of strength for continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 But if he wants to break his arm and let out blood the second time, and his body is strong: then do that after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 But if he wants to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side of the parts that lean: it must be for him to occur on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 But if in his body there is already much heated blood and it has become sharp, and causes fever to occur: it must be for him to exit from that blood into a vessel one by one, and extract a large quantity; and the opening should be amplified as far as syncopes occur: after you have been conserving all conditions of phlebotomy: and place your hand over his lung in line with the course of blood, so that it does not happen to death at the spot of syncopes.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 Often this happens when the phlebotomist is unaware, and there is negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 And it should not be when he wants to break his arm and let out blood the second time, with already a closed vessel opening, and difficult blood flow happens upon him suddenly, and is quickly stretched too much.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 Indeed, that is a very bad thing; so dismiss it for now until you bleed it a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 The removal of that clotted matter from the blood at the vessel opening should be done with sharpness; and place some dissolved salt on it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And put something from the plant called tiroca or saqzenae on it; and gently compress with a bandage until the blood is expelled.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 If indeed the vessel has already been swoln up, then dismiss it; and do not cover it until the swelling subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 If the need arises to bleed again and there is no excuse, then either place a phlebotome above that location or on another vessel in a different arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The vessels of the arms are bled at the places called Fusca and Basilica; and if they cannot be found or are hidden because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the quality of that phlebotome is to introduce a weak hand into warm water, until it turns red easily and the vessel appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then gently tighten above it with a bandage slightly on the medium (not too) tension.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then the second phlebotome is performed gradually, not laterally, nor along its length: and let it have an open hole large enough, and let your phlebotomy be on top of the bandage where the hands are slightly connected.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If blood flow is prohibited, then repeat the hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you meet your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 But if it is during the summer days, then you are excused from repeating the hand wash with warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 And indeed most of all blood flow should be directed into warm water during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And the bleeding of this vessel is a rescue for all vessels, because it does not have under it a pulsing vessel nor nerves.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 Yet phlebotomy of the right hand Saluatelle is said to be relieving various diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the quality of that phlebotomy is such that you tighten the Mahasan hand with a bandage or your own hand after inserting it into warm water until the vein swells and shows great pain.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then turn the phlebotome over.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you cut it completely through, it will not harm anything else.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 And save the hand, so as not to lose your hand with a phleebotome.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For under this there are nerves of the fingers shorn from flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then repeat with your hand to warm water and let the blood run into that.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not repeat it in warm water, the blood clots at the vein's opening and is prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 Thus when you have drawn out the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt over it so that it does not solidify quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, you should do with every cut branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 Yet the juice of that phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it relieves diseases of the spleen; and similarly do its phlebotomy as you did on the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The saphenous juice of phlebotomy is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the matrix, and retention of menstruation, and renal weaknesses, and old ulcers of hips and legs, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 And the quality of that phebletomy is such that it inserts its weak foot into warm water: and rubs over it, until veins burst out; and bind above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 Indeed, there is a vein at the heel, appearing toward the thumb side; and it branches out into many branches on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore, it is located in a larger branch of its own or near the heel in connection with it; for it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If the veins are on the face of the foot, then take care not to injure the nerves that lie undernecu below the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your lancet where you wish to puncture the veins from across it, as if you intend to pierce them: and the lancet is Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 However, if blood flow is obstructed, then soak the foot several times in warm water; and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 That if the vein is wrongly punctured at first, then continue with phlebotomy toward the upper part; for it is safe, and do not take harm from it when you injure the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And likewise with the other saphenous vein of the foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The sciatic veins are located, as we have said, at the heel from the shaded side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And the lancet of its puncture is for pain in the ankle, when it is because of warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 And the quality of its puncture is that it should be introduced into weak water, and quick; and bind the leg from the side of the anche up to above the heel by four small threads: for it does not appear except because of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 Whenever it appears, then puncture it according to whatever skill is possible for you, or across; and it is better, or as if you were to cut into it with an incision, or divide it by a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 For its place is safer, and itself is very hidden among many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find it and there is no sign at all by sensation: then take a branch of the same [vein], which is that one on the back of the foot, towards the ear side: and cut from the nerve, and let run as much blood as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then loosen the tightness, and place a dressing over the site of the incision, and compress the area firmly.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 For it is healed quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 Regarding Ventiators [Ventilation devices], and the use of such.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 They arise from horns, and iron, and from brass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And indeed the ventilation is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With scarring and bloodlettcuing: and the other is without scarring.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this ventilation that is without scarring, there are two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it involves heat. (Note: The sentence in Latin ends with "aut," which
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it does not involve heat.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the ventilation given by scarring and bloodletting are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 Of which one is Alnocrati ventilation and it is at the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the ventilation of Hagdahim are two layers on each side simultaneously: and mentalis, and it is below the lower jaw in front of the mouth: and duarum spatularum, and they are for both wings: and Alachosos above the end of the tail: and focilium uentosae super medium brachii: and cruris uentosae at the middle calf: and cauillarum ventosis.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And indeed the ventilation does not extract blood from you through small scattered veins in the flesh, and because of that it does not lose strength as is the case with those from incision. (Note: The Latin sentence ends with "sicut," which means "as" or "like".)
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary to administer bloodletting either with fire or without fire for any illness that arises from congestion, until the whole body has bled out.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity arises to perform bloodlettamo for an illness or by custom, let us administer it at the beginning of each month, its end, and midway through it, as well as at any time deemed appropriate.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 This is because there are people who when they have a great deal of blood, until they require its removal by bloodletting, find swelling and itching on their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And among them are those who have found congestion and redness on their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And among them are those who have found itching on their face, forehead, and darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And among them are those who lick the place of their bloodletting.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one whose grin increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And among them are those who have found a taste for blood in their mouth, or the tongue bleeds and expels blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And among them are those who see blood and redness, dead things, wounds, and similar things in their sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 Whenever we see something from among them, especially if it occurs on the third quarter of the month: let us then require bloodletting to be performed after they have passed two or three days.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The bloodletting of the neck is as follows: because it causes heaviness on the head and what flows into the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 However, this should be after a complete body bleeding.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And indeed, this bloodletting is the place for a cephalic (head) phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And it is not permissune to use this remedy for those who have a cold disposition or are suffering from catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 For him there will be great harm done.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And for this reason, it is not advisable to use it for the elderly or those with cold headaches.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 But if one becomes excessively dependent on it, he will suffer from forgetfulness as a result.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And for this reason, you should instruct those using the Ventiator to lower their hand when it is slightly windy, fearing the production of forgetfulness as a consequence.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Ventilation or Alkehela is the place for bloodletting of Black Fleamouth and Basilicamouth, and because of this it causes asthmatic conditions, chest tightness, gasping due to instrumental faults, coughing up sputum, and congestion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it is necessary to push the Ventiator Alkehela only slightly since if placed lower, it weakens both heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 However, Ventiator alhagdahim causes headaches and eye troubles, migraond, toothache at the roots of teeth, and constriction, being a place for bloodletting of Basilicamouth.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And you should instruct those using the Ventiatur to not raise their hand during scratching so that it does not cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Ventilation under the chin causes tooth decay and gum disease among other oral afflictions, and it is a place for bloodletting of Aliehericamouth which are on both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Ventilation of the tongue causes a condition called Alkhafacha from rubbing and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Ventilation of the inner parts of two balls causes a swelling from bloodletting of three veins - Basilicamouth, Black Fleamouth, and Cephalica, since they draw blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh, and they pull these small vessels from other larger ones until it reaches the attraction to the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And you must instruct using the fan, so that it does not progress too far into the incision: for the place is stripped of flesh, and underneighboring are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 However, a fan that applies suction on the alchaüs causes hemorrhoids of the anus and lower sores.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 And you must instruct using the fan so that it is large and made of metal: for the place requires strong suction, and perhaps the delicate fans may break underneath: and perform a large incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 However, the fans diminish by a clear reduction: for they attract blood from the entire body and transfer to old pains in the kidneys, wombs, and bladder; they provoke menstruation, and cause whooping cough, and hiccups; and stand in place of phlebotomy of two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the alhorcoben fan has a closeness of fainting like that of the fans of two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the position of fans is that you place them first in a vacuumed state and draw with tempered suction; and do not prolong the positioning of the fans, but place them swiftly, and remove them swiftprise: so that fluids come to the location of arrival equally. Do not cease this process nor continue it, until you see the place turning red and swelling, and the redness of blood appears: then indeed make an incision, and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in the positioning of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For those who are from humans with tender flesh and rare pores, it is appropriate that you incise them once only, not more: so that the place may not become ulcers.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And command the bellows to enhance the incision and make it shallow a bit; also adjust the suction to ease, speed, and gentle movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is an excess of blood coagulation, then you should incise it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 Indeed, the first passage is opened for subtle bloodletting and its watery nature; and in the second, an exact investigation for the removal of coagulated blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If indeed the blood is very foul, then a third incision should be made to achieve the final result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And for the end, when we wish to remove blood gradually or just a little, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 That if we want multiple removal of blood, let's make many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make a deep incision; and the end of equality in incision is equal depth of skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 What is that which should be administered from the oils for bellows placement, and what must one forbear with the bellows.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In that very whose skin is thick, hard, dark-colored and its pores are narrow, it should be rubbed with ointment for bellows placement from open, mild, resolute oils: if in the summer season as oil of alchibaetis or scented oil, or oil of sweet amygdalus seeds, or oil of pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is in the winter season then oil of daffodils, or oil of lily, or camphor oil, or sandalwood oil; and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If indeed excess of thickness is cold: then let it be bitter oil, or oil of balsamita or white oil, or aniseed oil; and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If indeed the large pores need to be cleansed of tender flesh, then it must be forbidden with oil, and these areas should be washed after waxing with rose water or cold water, or boiled water, or pumpkin water, or portulaca water, etc.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 But for those whose blood is of much moisture, they should wash the pores with vinegam or myrtle water and sumac, etc.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 For those whose excesses are large, they should wasn't their pores with old wine or samson water or anet root decoction or chamomile, etc.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 And it is necessary that waxing be done in the bathhouse or at a place of washing, indeed it must be administercued after leaving the bath for one hour or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And it should not happen that anyone sleeps after waxing.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 What is to be done so that ventosating or phlebotomy be conducted before waxing.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And after that, consider firstly: if ventosating or phlebotomy is choleric, and overcome by the sharpness and inflammation of his blood: then it must be received with cooling, like granate musk; also an endivo mixed with vinegar and lettuce, and absinth, etc.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 And place his food eggs, and lean meats should be eaten by him, and dishes seasoned with aloe: etc.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 And for whom the complexion is cold, he should take in his drink syrup of honey or almijuela, or agave nectar made from seeds: and he should drink fragrant wine that is medium between old and new: and it is to be instructed, use sparingly food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 And put his chicks and young ones to grain, as well as sparrows, that is, young pigeons; the doves' offspring will also hatch.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 And it is necessary that the drink for ventilation and bloodlettamo be more than food; and one should give in wine to certain people at tyriana hours, or a remedy from musk, that is, muscatel, or alesselithe before ventilation, or after: so as to comfort the main parts of the body, and let the blood thinner.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it should not be taken in a heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Regarding ventilation without incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 And those that are ventilated without incision, are called Ventosae that are placed over the eyebrow, and the spleen, and the liver, and over the diaphragn, the navel, and the areas of the kidneys, and the anus: for these parts do not endure incisions on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 And it is not sought through them, unless for an attraction from a blood vessel to a part of the body: such as we place a Ventosa over the nipples in the illness of a nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them so that the cold and stubborn ventilation from one part does not affect another part: such as we place Ventosae over the diaphragm, and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For these indeed thin the part, and warm it up, and drive away pain because they have resolved that ventilation.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 Also a Ventosa is placed over the kidneys when there occurs an accumulation or stone within them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 For perhaps by the strength of its own attraction it may open up a blockage, or expel a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly does it when placed over the eyebrow and spleen to tire out a ventilation within both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 And these cupping therapeby simple incision are administered.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are applied with heat.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are administered with warm full water for diseases of pleurisy: and this is done by filling the cupping set, or by using only warm water alone, or water in which medicinal herbs have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 The form of a cupping treatment applied with heat.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 The size of the opening is two fingers apart as we have constructed it; and its depth should be half a palm's width; and its side hole should be in the midpoint, about at the level where the needle enters: made from bronze or citrus alike with thick edges, softened, equal and smoothed, so that it does not injure the body upon placement beneath it; and there is a rod running through the middle, made of metal or iron, on which the candle with heat is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now this cupping set is made large, greater than I have mentioned before, and somewhat smaller that one; according to the conditions and age of the person who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 For indeed cupping sets for boys are different, and those for emaciated persons are as such; they differ from men's and of robust bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of placing this cupping set with heat on the body is that you must light a wick soaked in pitch from flax or place a small candle made of tallow; and put it over the middle rod which runs through the cupping set, that the fire may burn somewhat below the bottom part of the cupping set so as not to burn the body of the sick person.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then it should be placed on the body; and a finger should rest over the hole I mentioned until we hold the cupping set: while unsaturated, remove your finger, so that vapour escapes through that hole, and the cupping set immediately loosens up.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then take a cautery according to its proper method and apply it again if necessary.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 The ventosa that is applied during the illness of pleurisy with water is not a reverse rod or hole and it is only applied because it is filled with water and placed over the limb alone.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And this ventosa, the larger one which can hold a large amount of water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 § On hanging Bloodsuckers.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Bloodsuckers are not applied in multiple places unless on limbs where it is impossible to place ventosas because of their protruding nature, such as the lip and gums and similar areas.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or on an uncovered limb from flesh, like fingers, nose, and similar areas.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the manner of their use is such that one takes from bloodsuckers that are in sweet waters, cleaned from decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they are thrown into the sweet water day and night until they are hungry, and nothing remains inside their bodies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Then the body is dried first with fleam extraction, and ventosas.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then cleanse the limb of the sick person until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Then they are placed over it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 And when they are filled and fall off, and it is possible to extract from the location with a ventosa, then it is more effective for healing: and if not, then cleanse the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then with much water, and rubbed, and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 But if the course of blood is prolonged after the loss of bloodsuckers and it is a reabsorption (residual): then pour flax linen into cold water and place it over it until the resorption separates out.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if there is an increase of blood, then sprinkle over it ground fenugreek or gallnuts and similar substances from styptic plants: until the blood separates out.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Then they are placed over the wound as half-peeled broad beans: and spread out, so that the beans touch the place; for blood is separated (or clotted).
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And it is necessary if repetition of leeches is needed, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 But if the leeches are prevented from hanging, then cleanse the area with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or fix thorns at places until some blood is drawn out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then they are placed there, for when they feel something from the blood, they immediately stick (or attach).
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 Whenever you wish them to fall, sprinkle some of ground aloe, salt or ashes over them; and they immediately fall off (or drop).
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 Section II: Conclusion.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 General remarks on restoration, dislocation, and treatment of torticollis, and the like.
Caput I.	 Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine and concerns the restoration of bone fractures, and dislocations due to accidents involving bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know that sons, for some foolish physicians and laypeople boast about this chapter, as well as those who have never seen any ancient book nor read from it a letter.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And because of this reason, the method described herein has been kept private within our lands' knowledge. (Note: This translation seems to be an addition by the translator rather than part of the original text and therefore does not match the instruction.)
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never been entirely ignorant of it; and I have not learned from it except for the length of time spent reading ancient books and the study over their understanding until extracting knowledge from them. (Note: Again, this translation seems to be an addition by the translator rather than part of the original text.)
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I have attached myself through experimentation and study over the course of my life. (This sentence also appears as a likely addition from the translator's side, not part
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 And now I have described to you everything that contains my knowledge in this Chapter: and beyond what has been omitted experiment, after I abbreviated it for you, and liberated it from the occupation of elongation, and after I finished the abbreviation, and showed its end declination; and I formed many forms out of the forms of instruments used in it, when there is an addition of declination, as I did in two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 And in the first place, and collections of broken bones, from those whose preliminary examination is necessary, before we begin to remember diverse kinds of limb fractures, each one.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary to say in the preface of this Chapter, about heads and chapesteps, whose understanding seems essential at first: that you may know or learn this noble art from you, and those who are prompt.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 Therefore, I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or fall occurs: then one must hasten first to bleed him and loosen him, or both together: if nothing prohibits it, as weakness of strength: or he is the one who has something like this happen from a boy or old decrepit person: or it is time of very strong heat, or very strong cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then be content with his own food, cold vegetables and fatty meats, and he-goat meat: and prohibit wine, and heavy meats, and fill up from the foods and all nourishment that fills blood vessels.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until when you are secure from a warm poultice and not a leakage of matter to the limb: then let him return weakly to his first diet with which he was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that the sick person be nourished with foods rich, heavy, and coarse in substance, such as dishes made from cooked wheat mixed with water, rice, heads of garlic, feet, intestines of dates, eggs, fish, thick wine, and similar items.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 When this treatment is administeramo for the broken bone, it heals more quickly.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that broken bones, when they are in elderly and decrepit men, it is not possible for them to continue and be supported always according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs; they consolidate and persist at the end with gentleness, like the bones of young children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 However, nature connects something like glue to the broken bone from all sides, which has bulk that adheres and holds it together until they are joined together again and connected again until strength and firmness come at last as in the beginning, before anything prevents them by their own processes: for this reason it is necessary to place foods rich, heavy, and coarse in substance for the sick person, which have bulk, viscosity, and grossness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And you know that the types of breaks are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs: for a break of the leg is different from a head bone break: and a chest bone break is different from a backbone break: similarly all other parts have their distinct nature in healing: and I come with recollection when exposing all types of breaks described in its own chapter, distinguished from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 And the types of bone breaks also vary among themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Since it is a buckle fracture, aside from occurrangs therein small stars (comminutions).
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes it is a fracture along the length of the bone: and there are fragments thereof, that is, small stars (comminutions), and additions proceeding as in reeds when fitted with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not progressing; there is also a fracture accompanied by an ulcer and a fissure at the head, as well as a small crack (fissure).
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And for every kind there is an ingenious device or tool proper to its restoration according as it presents itself in its places (specific locations).
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from this it is known that the bone's fracture, there is its curvature and protrusion of itself; and the appearance of it to sense, and sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 However, when there is no apparent curvature in the place, nor sound at your touch when you strike the bacteria with an agitation, and a great infirm does not find much pain: then it is not there a fracture, indeed it may be possible that it is a tortuosity, or a small crack; therefore one should not move it entirely with hand pressure alone, but rather place medicines on top of it according to the reminder that comes afterward following such momentum which arrives in its place: then it is bound by a subtle ligature.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that when the place is curved and divided into two, except that there occur therein small fragments (comminutions), however all parts are removed from their match: then you should begin from your time towards its correction, balancing it before hot ulceration occurs on it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 However, if a hot ulceration does occur to it, then let it be left for some days until the inflammation subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then balance it in any way that can with softness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And you know that the restoration and balancing of it are easier than in bones where fractures occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then tightly grasp it, according to how its memory comes to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If indeed there are fractures in the bones, then it is necessary to extend this injured member from two parts if it is a hand or foot; or with your own hand if it is an arm; or with two ropes or a rope and a chain.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And your position should be such that you place the limb on a level surface according to its natural shape until when the fractured parts are extended: then try with all your ingenuity to return those additions in any way possible in their places; and carefully, according to your strength, so that no pain occurs due to your operation, nor injury; and you should also apply with your strength, one or both bones together with the companion's help, following better shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 And it is fitting at that time when you try and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 But if then you see something different, correct it, and make that right according to the measure of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And beware of strong extensions and firm compressions, as do many ignorant people.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For often they cause it to happen a hot abscess or constriction of the limb through their operations, as we have already seen from those operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then connect after the balancing and descent of the operation, and the tightening of that limb, and peace, and calmness; and instruct the sick person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And make it not move in the hour of its resting and sleep at its resolution and agitation, and at its evacuation, and all movements with its last strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And so as to check, let there not be a position of the body that is with which follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 That is, because when it feels pain or injury in the position of the body part: then one must change it to a position from which it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And with this, that the position be equal and upright: so that there may not occur twisting of the body part when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of the stricture of the broken bone is as I have said.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that broken bones vary greatly in their weakness, and in their size, and in their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 These therefore are small, such as the arm and finger, and easy, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 These however are large, such as the hip and leg, it is necessary that there be a wrapping for them wide, firm.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 For the broad ligament connects large members and binds it from every part of equal stricture, so that no rupture enters it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then begin after your evacuation to place an ointment suitable to that, in a soft sponge gently on the place of its fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin to wrap the ligament three or four wrappings over the place of its fracture, as needed by the member: and bind it with your hand very slightly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then go along with it to the upper part from the place of its fracture, and bind less than your original stricture as you fastened the place of the fracture.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then stretch you with the wrapping from the place of its fracture very slightly, and gradually alleviate the stricture, until you reach a large amount from a healthy location.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another wrapping, and wrap it again over the place of its fracture wrappings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Then he proceeds with the reduction to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your operation be on the tightening of the reduction, and its softening, as we have said in the first upper reduction.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the reductions of soft padding or cloth with which the twisting of the function is leveled, if there is a twist in it; and if not, do not put anything on it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then perform the reduction on the other side as well.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Afterwards, immediately make these reductions irregular with weights if there is no swelling at the place nor hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 But if there is swelling or an abscess on it; then place something on the spot of that abscess and remove the inflammation: and dismiss it for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then tightly wrap those reductions.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 And let the reductions be of cane shreds spread thin and well-formed: or from wood whence are made sieves, which are made from pine, or garaid, that is to say, palm branches, or caley; and the size of all the reductions should be according to this form, and such like shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, it is necessary that the reduction placed on the actual wound be somewhat thicker and wider than the others; and the length of the reductions should correspond to what is allowed by the size and width of the limb.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then tightly wrap those reductions with bandages likewise in accordance with the first reduction mentioned.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then bind above with threads properly, as we have said of the tightening; and it is that your reduction should be over the place of the f^racture more: and as far longer it extends from the fracture, so lesser shall the tightening be.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 And it is required that they are threads of medium thickness and fineness, and made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 Since if the threads are too thick, as I have seen in the surgery of the pylorus closing with their twisted strings, it is a great mistake: for the stricture falls short of them in quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And again thin threads do not match: for you will not achieve through the stricture that which you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 And it is not fitting to be less than the width of a finger between stars (points).
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the sick one is harmed by the points after stricture at places that are healthy: then place under them from flax or carded wool until nothing is harmed therefrom.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 But when it is a fracture with an ulcer and happens a rupture of the skin, I come to remembering that in Chapter Two on particularities. (Note: This text seems more like instructions for where to find further information or similar cases rather than a continuation of the previous explanation.)
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken limb must be bound with points from the first day. (Note: This text also seems to give advice or an alternative approach rather than continuing the previous discussion.)
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 For it is because when the limb is large, you should not place points on top of it unless after five days or seven or more, according to your security from warm hematomas (swelling). (Note: This text seems like a guideline for a specific scenario rather than translating further details about surgical techniques.)
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is the mode of plasters with which the ancients restored, that are placed over a fracture and dislocation. (Note: Again, it's giving information on historical practices rather than continuing a discussion.)
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 ¶ The common abbreviated plaster mode restoring fractures, suited to many constitutions, especially women and children: for it is on that which does not succumb to heat nor cold. (Note: Providing more information about a certain technique rather than translation of the original.)
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And you receive from the milling dust, and it is the core of flour that hangs on the walls of the mill when in motion: and prepare it as such, except making crumbles of it with albugineous substance; and place the concoction not thick nor fine. (Note: Giving a description of obtaining and preparing materials for medicinal purposes.)
Deinde utere eo.	 Then apply it there.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another emplaster method for a broken bone, and a dislocation, or a twist.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Mix the breadcrumbs, and honey, and acacia, and goldenrod, and mugwort; add all of these substances equivalent to ten myrrh, and both kinds of aloes equal five each, and twenty thrice-boiled doses; mix everything well, grind it finely, then blend with alethal water or with white lead if the patient's complexion is hot.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then apply this emplaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it promotes the healing of broken bones quickly and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another emplaster method that also benefits a break or twist.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Mix mugwort, and honey, and white wormwood, all equal ten myrrh, and both kinds of aloes equal five acacia boli armeni each twenty doses are mixed many times over, ground finely, then made into a paste with water or white lead and given to the patient.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 An emplaster method for joints separated from their places, and it alleviates pain resulting from these conditions as well as a bone cut or break.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take woolen fleece, immerse it in vinegar and boiled oil; then place it on the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 In this emplaster there is no restorative power but it is good for cooling inflammations and dispelling pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 An emplaster method that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take fig leaves and sycamore maple leaves; then make an ointment from both of these ingredients.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 An emplaster method for accelerated healing of a bone break; and when you wish to resolve remaining inflammations.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Take one part each of horsetail root, chamomile, flower pollen, and grain of a herb; grind all together, mix with wine if the member is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it indeed is heated, then prepare that with moist water of coriander or plain water and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another mode for a stronger plaster, to resolve, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Take one part each of horsetail root, flaxseed, balaustia, mellilotus, samphire, flower pollen, chamomile; grind all together, prepare with willow water or sweet water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 The whole of it according to the heat and calmness of the limb.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrasterly did not say in his book that it should be placed over a broken limb during its restoration, unless made from cerate and oil; nothing else, and he described it as a medium between thickness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galen perhaps suggested that they should be placed over a broken limb during its restoration in which is the heat of inflammation, such as myrrh, and aloe and frankincense, and like substances mentioned by us earlier.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Mode for a plaster that provides relief to injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Take lice and beans, and capsules of the human scalp shaven or feathers of birds or horsetail, and equal parts salt; grind all together, sieve it, prepare it from this plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The quantity however as it should be so that there remains a bandage, then dissolve, is when you consider at that time if pain does not occur in the sick, nor itching, nor movement of the broken bone from its place: do not resolve that for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If it happens to him in that place a pressing itch or restless pain or swelling occurs: then promptly remove and loosen the bandage from there, and take linen cloth or sea sponge soaked with warm water: immerse it in lukewamoer water, and wash the area with it until the itch subsides and the pain settles down.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then let him lay off for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place a cloth soaked with vinegar and oil, or rose oil over it: and bind it on top for one night, until you are sure that the heat has been removed, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and the pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat this for a slight contraction and apply a small bandage on it: and do not bind the limb with your first tightening or fine-tuning until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the wound, redness, pain, swelling, and all other conditions are completely gone, and you find the bandage and tightening as before: then repeat this as carefully as you did first.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing of these things happens to the limb that we mentioned, then do not loosen it unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when this is let go for twenty days completely as it appears from the healing of the limb that we mentioned, do not add more than your first tightening until the fracture adheres and a coagulation forms over it: then also at that time add in the thickness of foods to the patient, according to his progressive recollection.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If however you see the wound of the fracture already dried and emaciated more than necessary: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Therefore, insert it with warm water near every person to whom you apply it, and let it be so for the three days, and amen the tightening is just right.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 Therefore, this operation goes to the nourishment of the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 However, that which is done by the foolish restorers from a limb fracture of another type, when it does not heal first as it should, and heals secondly with curvature, comes from their error in operation, and great fear: if it were correct, they would have said so in their books, and done operations according to that.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I did not see at all such a trace among them, and rather it is better that this should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 Of the construction of an accident on the head.
Caput III.	 Head III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 There are various types of fractures and many shapes thereof: and its causes are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For a fracture is that which occurs from a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the bone up to where it has reached the diaphragm, which is underneath the skull: and because of this it is called the Axial species of fractures.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or the sword cuts some bone and breaks its face but does not pierce the incision to its end: and this type of fracture is called Kalān, that is, complete separation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And a fracture is that which is worn down or rubbed away: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or falling on a stone, or the like.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this type of fracture is also penetrating, which now approaches the panniculus underneath the bone or is on the face of the bone: and it is a wound of those two types of fractures again either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And there is a type of fracture that is hidden within the bone subtly at its hairline: it is a small crack, and because of this it is called a capillary faster.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And among these is a fracture that occurs from a fall or by being struck with a stone; similar to those which cause the insertion of an osteal lamina into the inner parts: as happens in hot air balloons, when they are hit and part of them enter inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 And indeed it is most common with bones that are still soft, such as the heads of children's bangs.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And all these types of separated spinal fractures occur, and indeed I come with the memory of it being entirely at its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 And we know all these types of fractures through detecting them on it, and examining them with probes, and removing the decayed flesh that is over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The capillary type is known by this, being detected over the bone and cleared, and bounded by it with wax; indeed the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the healing of fanciers, consider firstly infirmities caused by accidents; then if you see from these conditions that it means a clear sign on fears, such as vomiting from cholera, and extension, and loss of intellect, and cutting off of voice, and syncopes, and acute fever, and exiting eyes, and redness in them, and similar conditions due to many accidents in disorders, presumably it is not healed: and if you see that these frightful conditions do not discourage you, and you hope for health; then begin the cure of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 That is if it comes to you with wounds first; and that occurs during winter months, then one should study the removal of bone on the fourteenth day after every condition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 And if it is in the days of summer, then one must hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what lies beneath the bone from a fold becomes corrupted, and those things happen as we have told you.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 But if the bone fracture has already reached the fold touching the brain and is with little fragments, and attracted: then one must cut and grind the crushed and shattered part, as I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And one must scrape the head of the wounded: and remove any bone that is possible for you to do so: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is slightly above the weak area.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 But if this happens to you during the extraction of bones with blood flow, or with hot pus: then apply what is necessary for it.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And one must fill the place with soaked linens in wine and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until the pus settles, and you are secure from blood flow.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin healing of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 One method indeed is to cut the bone with a sharp knife blade: and here is that form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then apply another sharp knife after the width of the previous one, not much more: and this is that shape.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then you also apply another sharp knife wider than before.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 The second method is that you have a number of different sharp knives: some are wider than others and some are narrower: and they should be at the extreme ends of their sharpening, and made from forged iron or flint: and use them with ease in percussion on the sharp edge, so as not to knock out the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If however the bone is strong and hard: then it must be that you pierce around it before administercuas with Terebratulae (auger-like tools) which do not penetrate deeply; and they are not called so, except because themselves do not pass beyond the limit of flesh in the bone to what is after it: therefore, because the Terebratula has a rounded tip over that which is under its head sharp, similar edge, and a small circle prevents submerging, and passing through the density of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it is fitting for you to receive a large number from these Terebratulae (auger-like tools), each of which must match the density of the bone; until one is present on all sides of the skull: the length and width of its pointed tip, according to the quantity of that bone's density.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three kinds of Terebratulae (auger-like tools), or trepanations.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 But the quality of piercing around a broken bone is: to place the Terebratula (auger-like tool) on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then switch the Terebratula (auger-like tool) to another location and place it where there is a quantity of thickness equivalent to the radius or about that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with Incisoria (surgical tools) between every hole in the bone: and make it as delicate as you can on top of that from thinning, as we have said, until eradicating the bone or your hand, or with someone else using some instruments which you prepared for this: like tweezebrushes.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary to use every precaution so that the Terebratula (auger-like tool) or any Incisoria touches nothing from a scar.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When therefore you walk around the bone by piercing it, and when separated from its membrane, if it is continuous with that, and when extracted, it should be scraped, and at an equal extremity of what remains in the bullosa with another tool similar to Incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 However, it must be thinner and more subtle than other instruments like Incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 But if something remains from the small bones, and chips: then take them with ease, with what is among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then care for the wound after that with linen swabs and ointments as we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 And another method of the surgery is simple, far from fear: which was said by Galen and praised greatly in that regard: and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 First of all, it is necessary for you to begin by revealing the bone piece from where the fracture is more intense and apparent: until when you have revealed that part, and placed under its extremity the lens-shaped tip of this Incisor, which is this shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And the lens-shaped part does not cut anything gently: and the sharp part of it on its two sides flowing into the length, as you see: let the lens-sized part be attached to the bullosa with its face cutting against the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike over the Incisor with a small mallet from one side, until you cut through the entire bone easily, as it returns: and be sure of the gauze that does not happen to fall into that happening, which you fear greatly.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the healer was not wiser than men and more ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from gauze in certain places, he would cut it off with its lens-shaped tip's extremity, and free it easily with that.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 Therefore, he should be freed from him without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 And if the bone fracture does not penetrate to the panniculus and that which is separated from the bone is its surface, with the remaining roughness and fine threads: then you should scrape off this roughness and remove those fine threads with subtle rasors of which you have prepared a variety of different quantities so that it may be possible for you to administer them in any suitable and better manner according to how your operation leads you to, and the fractured bone itself.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And it is necessary for you to administer them according to reason, firstly by scraping the bangs of the bone more widely with those rasors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use afterward a finer one thereof.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not cease to do that according to continuity until you reach the thinnest and most subtle of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 And in every one of the remaining small cracks and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer care according to what leads you to their correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And it is a matter that does not remain hidden over everything, to which there is any study in this art, and has stood over what we have written and shown about large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If however the detected panniculus remains when you remove the bone: then it is necessary for you to take lime powder according to the amount of wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another double or triple layer of lime, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first layer: and do what you can more easily on that, so that it may not be covered with syphaca.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer above it a wide bandage: and do not tighten it, except by the amount that holds only the wound: and dismiss it with this care on one day or two days, until you are secure from hot swelling.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it and apply the necessary medicaments along with which there is excess dryness, such as lily roots, herb flour, thorn powder, aristolochia, and similar things; and make a dust from these medicaments to be applied over the wound as if they were dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And generally apply all medicine there with properties that prevent and do not sting.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And be careful according to your ability, so that the wound in your treatment may be clean: neither should there be dirt in the ointment, nor stinginess.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 Nor should you ever allow a virus to accumulate there at all; for when the virus aggregates on the cerebral panniculus, it corrupts it and putsrefies it, and great harm comes after that to the sick person: and already this has happened in syphilitic head, when cleansed by it with oil, especially if its care is neglected, a blackness appears on the surface of it.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Then consider, if such misfortunebefore us come to a sick person, you know that it is most harmful without doubt.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if blackness does not come about, unless from the medicine that is put on it, and is in accordance with the properties of that medicine to make such a blackness: then you should take one part honey, three parts rose oil, and mix them together with wool fat.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then apply it to the syphilitic head: afterwards care for it with the methods of treatment that are suitable until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 Of the restoration of Nas when it breaks.
Caput IIII.	 Head IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that Nasal bones are only broken if the two upper parts of it together or one of them: for they themselves are two bones: because its lower part is cartilaginous and does not break and nothing happens to it except friction, twisting, and shocks.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of its two parts is broken, then it must be introduced by inserting a small finger into the nostril hole, and with your index finger and thumb push it out until the nose returns to its natural form: and let this be done artfully, easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And carefully, so that by your operation there may not happen to pain upon the sickly.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 But if there is a fracture in the upper part of the nose and it does not reach with your finger: then it must be equalized at its tip, where there should be a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 But if the function is broken into two parts, then do similar to this: and hasten with its restoration on the first day of its being broken, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day at peace in warm swellings.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert into the tip of the nose a linen lincture if the function is broken into one part: or insert two linen linctures if the function is broken into two parts: and let there be in the lincture such thickness as fills the hole of the nose.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some of the old restorers have said that they are to be soaked in butter and exchanged every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 But this does not seem to me, indeed it should be, that they are soaked in the white of eggs mixed with wheat flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then put away the lincture until the bone is hardened and the cartilage is made tough.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the place of the lincture on the linen cloth after it has been softened: and this holds the broken nose more strongly, and so that the sickly one may not be hindered from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not a necessary thing.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you wish, do this: and if you wish, do the linctures.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If while you are working on the nose again and an abscess occurs, apply a plaster to the nose with pitch or soaked woolen cloth, or with a little vinegar solution.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if the abscess does not occur again hot, then it is necessary to apply a plaster with lupin flour and with the grease made from crushed tares mixed with alburnus.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a layer on top of the plaster, and do not press the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 But if the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, then it is necessary to cut them and extract them with instruments that suit them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then use a pair of scissors, and care for it with what is used to cover it, and make it solid with suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If an injury to the nose occurs, then it is necessary to care for it with linen and dressings: and administer a lead tube until healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Regarding the restoration of the lower jaw when it is disrupted.
Caput V.	 Head V. (Vinculum or v
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jab is disrupted and its fracture is not with a wound: then examine if it is only a fracture outside, and does not break into two parts, and care for the inside: then recognition of it is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if there is a fracture on the right side of it, insert the left index finger into the injured bone: similarly, if there is a frawk on the left mandible, then insert the right index finger: and push with that swelling from the fracture outwards easily to the outside with your other hand from the inside part of the bone correctly, and with it equally.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer separation from both sides according to correctness: until it is possible to equalize them.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 However, if such an accident has already occurred to the teeth, either displacement or luxation; then bind them with wires of which you hope something will remain, made of gold, silver, or hair.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place a compress on the broken jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place doubled bandages over it, and large irregularly shaped leather on the skin; or a piece of goatskin equal to the length of the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bandage it up as you have prepared the ligature for this case and as its application fits, until it is not destroyed; and instruct the patient to maintain calmness and rest, and place his food intakes gently.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 However, if you consider that something has changed the shape to some form or other: then promptly and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct what has been altered from it and make plasters of clean mill powder with albumen or wheat flour after you have removed the compress; and place gentle woollen over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While this bandage remains over it and the position of the bone does not change, let it heal without loosening until cured; or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 This fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 But if an inflammatory swelling occurs meanwhile, then apply the aforementioned often-mentioned soothing dressing until that swelling is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if the fracture has occurred with a wound, consider this.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 For if there has already been separated from the bone a piece of bone or fatty tissue: then carefully examine this and remove such fragments together with what suits you for their removal using instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 However, if the wound's opening is narrow, then enlarge it with a fleam according to your required amount.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then, when you withdraw that bandage and nothing remains from it on the wound, then apply your opening to the wound if it is large; and if not, place over it some plasters that are suitable for this purpose and let them become united, until healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 Regarding the restoration of the furcule when broken.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 Indeed, it is most often the forepart of the furcule from the part of the humerus that breaks, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Or it breaks and is separated into two parts, except as follows regarding the bandages: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or so that what happens with the bone bandages: and it is more difficult to restore them.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or thus, there is a fracture accompanied by a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the operation when there is a fracture without a wound should be as follows: make sure that there are two assistants present, one to hold on to the supportive equipment following the broken furcule and the other extending the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then make sure that the break is equal with your fingers until its form is as it should be: and neither prominent nor sunken.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 And if you find that the extension is more, then it should be as follows: place underne.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 But if you cannot pull the extremity of the furcule to the outside because it has reached depths: then it should be as follows - let the patient lie on his back and place under the humerus medium-sized in size, and attach a sling to his lower arm, until the bone that is in the deep rises to the surface; and then correct the fracture and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If however you feel a locking at the site of the bone spike, and it moves: then one must bind over that area, and remove the bone spike with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If however there is a tendency in the bone, then apply your incision tools made from one of the prepared teeth you have placed under the bone spike where you will place the servant tool which serves; it is an implement of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a scoop that has no hollows.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And its width is according to the one you find from its size of the bull and its thickness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 The length also, accordingly as it is possible for you in surgery.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And it has two ends as you see: one end being wide and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If however the tear of the wound that you cut when extracting the bone spike is wide, and secure it with hot caustic: then join two lips of the wound with a stitch.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the tear is small or accompanied by a hot swelling: then fill the wound with cloths and poultices according to the amount of stitches in the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 But if there is a hot swelling: then pour cloths in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place over it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 The incision of the bone when there is no wound and no cutting: it is as you put a poultice made from milling flour with fine ash over it.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place a linen bandage over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place the sponge under its tickling if you find that one.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a hemostat, that is, a wheel held by Saracens which is very long: and its width be one span or about so.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place a double-folded poultice on the bandage and ointment.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take a lancet from the delicate board, whose width be of three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then make an incision into it on the cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then make a cut with that cloth, along with the lancet, in the place of Alhimemat which lies over the fracture and location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place Alhimemat over the faster as you made a cut, and make an incision on it above its neck, and under the healthy tissue, and under the unhealthy tissue: and reduce it over the entire part, and see how much the constriction holds the fracture in place: and this is such that it does not hide over you, but all together so that the lancet is not moved from above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 And for this reason, you should look at the injured part every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 However many times then the ligament is softened, and you see that the lancet has moved: then correct it again, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the bed rest on its back, and put under the healthy tissue near it at night some poultices for him to ease his pain from that side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Thus the wing bone fracture is eased by elevating the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or bind his arm to its neck: and do not loosen the ligament, if it does not happen from itching or a boil, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then remake an ointment, if you see its face to that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add it to the constriction, and remove it, until it is restored and clotted.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 And indeed, the wing bone fracture is tightened and comforted most in ninety-eight days: and sometimes it happens to some people at a younger age.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 On repairing a spatulum fracture.
Caput VII.	 Chapter 지오판.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 The spatula rarely breaks, and at its wide place: and its edges do not break off from it but rather.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 Whenever it breaks from that place and breaks in the middle of it, and cannot know that without touching; then according to what its fracture figure is he tries to prepare it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And restore it on its natural shape in every way possible.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place dust of the milling powder with alabaster and gum resin, and above put dust from twofold cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place on that flat piece of fine board in quantity according to the amount of the whole spatula or slightly more than it is small.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If however under the flat piece there are depressions of some places of the spatular, then that same concavity with gum resin he makes equal until the flat piece descends evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then dry from above with elongated alchemists' ointment, of moderate pressure and the firmness of the flat piece until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And pay attention to the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However often then the ligament is softened, strengthen it and if the flat piece moves from its place: let it lie weakly on its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And indeed the spatula is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 Whenever you complete this number of days, then dissolve the ligament: and be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is from the bones whose union is not feared, nor their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 But if it proceeds from a piece of bone and pricks under the skin: then cut above that, and remove that thing.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do what we have said in the treatment of inflammations from saturated warmth, if it happens something like that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 On restoring a chest fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 Whenever the chest is broken in its middle part, and rarely that happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 The limbs of it are indeed broken very much and crushed from those injuries.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When it is broken at its middle part which leans towards the lower parts, and intense pain occurs to it along with difficulty in breathing, and coughing; perhaps it vomits blood, and swelling is declared on the fractured bone, and not concealed by sensation: restoring it consists of lying down weakly on its back: and placing something between its spines like dust.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then compress its shoulders and gather the ribs from both sides with hands: and delicately balance it as much as possible in that way until the bone regains its shape as it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place an ointment and plaster on it, and put over that a star from a table of fine willow or aloe, and such similar materials in lightness, after you have moistened it with cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then delicately bind it over the broken bone so that it is not removed: and proceed with binding according to its roundness several times towards the back, and tighten the fastening properly.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the fastening at every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it again: and if the need of his wound causes a dissolution near it because of an itch or corrosion which occurs in that place, or pain, or abscess: then quickly remove it, dissolve it, erase the ointam, and correct what happened according to the healing way of its.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the plaster if you see that it is necessary: and fasten to him again until healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 Chapter on restoring ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	 Chapter nine.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that a Costal fracture does not occur unless in the thick places that follow from the back and from the ends of those ribs on the anterior side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And friction does not occur to them because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of this is not hidden from sight during inspection by using fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And the restoration of this is as follows: A level fracture with fingers according to what is possible until it levels out in shape, as required.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then plaster and bind the broken bone with a splint if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 And if the rib fracture is severe towards the interior: then a strong pain in breathing occurs, and punctures as that puncture which happens to those who have pleurisy: because it pierces the membrane or also it causes difficulty of breathing, and coughs, and spitting of much blood: and this is difficult to treat.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And already the ancients were skilled in this with many devices: and among them are those who say that one should place foods for the sick which generate inflammation and moisture, so as to inflame the throat and extend it and push the faster towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 We however dislike that there is a cause for making a warm abscess, if not necessary.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 But if it has already happened, then one adds to that.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them say: place something moist over the spot, and then suck it out with strength, and this is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However, there is a fear that too much moisture will be drawn over the spot due to the weakness of the state.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them say: it is necessary to cover the spot with wool that has been immersed in warm oil; and small lumps are placed between the ribs, until they are filled up: so that there is an equal binding when inflated according to roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick man is treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If the ill person is suffering from an acute condition that cannot be tolerated and the bone is pierced by splinters or wounds, causing us fear over them: then it is necessary for us to examine above the place and discover if there is a broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we will place the tool that shapes the bone, which memory precedes: and with ease, we strike the bone and cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we will gather two edges of the wound if it is large with a seam: and heal them with plasters until they are healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If it happens that a hot abscess occurs during this period, then we must act quickly, and pour drops into rose oil, and place them on the spot: and treat the sick man with what is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 Also during this time, let him lie on his side over which he sleeps, until healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 § Regarding the restoration of a spinal and neck fracture.
Caput X.	 Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 But indeed the bones of the neck sometimes have a fracture and rarely experience friction: and similarly with spinal processes also.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 And so when this happens to someone, and they know whether it heals or does not heal: then let them consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see that his hands have become softened and stunned, and dead: and he cannot move them, nor stretch them, nor compress them: and when you compress them with your fingers, and prick them with a needn't feel it, nor feel any pain in them: then know that it does not heal, and is mortally ill.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 But if he can move them, and feel compression with his fingers and pricking: then know that the spinal bone is healthy, and that the sick person will be cured with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If similar spider lumps appear on his back and you know whether they are healed or not, then consider his feet; if you see that they have softened, and the same thing happens to them as happened in the hands: then when lying on his own back, he involuntarily excretes wind and waste: and when turned over onto his stomach, he involuntarily discharges waste: and when turned over onto his back again and wishes to urinate but cannot, then you know it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore there are no difficulties in treating him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 If this does not happen to him from that, the situation is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for him as a result of this is, as you know, to apply warm diaper rash oil; thus, place it on rubbed spider lumps: or with wool combs that have been eaten.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place it on that spot several times a day until the warm diaper rash oil has settled; then place one soothing, purgative compress over that area with a bandage covering it: and instruct the sick person to use rest and calmness.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 And he should not sleep on the part where he found pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If this happens at the fracture of the scaphoid bone or something that has already separated from it: then you should remove it by cutting the skin and taking it out.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then gather two edges of the wound together if it is large with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with something like a cream until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 But if the final bone of the tail is broken later: then you should insert your left thumb into the rectum, and with the other hand in equilibrium place the broken bone as evenly as possible, and secure secondarily.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on top of that and remove this one: and treat the wound as with the treatment that preceded, until healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Regarding the restoration of Ankai.
Caput XI.	 Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 The bones of Ankara are rarely broken. (Please note that 'Ankara' is a modern city in Turkey, but
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they are broken, the fracture is not there, but a comminution of their extremities: and they split along its length, and lean towards the interior; and it happens that pain occurs in the place where it breaks, and puncturing; and the leg that is broken becomes numb. (Please note that 'Ankara' here refers to a person or figurative entity within the context of a medical text.)
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And indeed its restoration is such that you should stretch out your hand over it until you stand above the figure of the flicture as it is. (Please note that 'Ankara' here refers to a person or figurative entity within the context of a medical text.)
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only such in its extremities, then make that fracture evenly, as you have prepared it from an equation, until it resembles its natural form. (Please note that 'Ankara' here refers to a person or figurative entity within the content of a medical text.)
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 But if the fracture is along its length, or already leans towards the interior; then make the patient lie on their belly and prepare for you the restoration of that fracture. (Please note that 'Ankara' here refers to a person or figurative entity within the content of a medical text.)
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 Whenever you have made it even, place an ointment over it; then place over it a strap from wood or skin: and securely bind the straps so that you fear no change in the fracture nor removal of the strap. (Please note that 'Ankara' here refers to a person or figurative entity within the content of a medical text.)
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And let it evenly cave in with that which fills it until the straps hold it according to equality; and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side. (Please note that 'Ankara' here refers to a person or figurative entity within the content of a medical text.)
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If however a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from extending it, and let the healing of itself occur, until the hot abscess rests; and place over it what was previously done, according to which there follows its healing: and tighten it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If indeed a fracture or break occurs outside the bone, apply external treatment.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 § Regarding the aid of healing fractures.
Caput XII.	 Head XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The aids are those that exist from the elbow to the head of the scapula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If therefore it breaks, then its healing is according to one or two kinds of methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One of which is: that you receive a plank wood of medium thickness according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And two cords are tied at the two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is hung from an elevated place; and the sick one sits on the bed.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then he throws his broken arm over the wood until it reaches near its elbow, with a sling attached in the middle of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then hang something light from above him to stretch himself towards the lower part.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the doctor equalizes the break with his hands at once until it is set right as needed.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 And another way is that the sick one lies supine over his own neck: and hangs his hand from his neck with a cord.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then command two ministers to keep one of them that is above the break with their hands: and let another hold it below him, and stretch each of them towards his own part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if you want a stronger extension, then tighten under the break with a cord and above it with another cord: and let each of the two ministers stretch towards their own parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If therefore the break is near the end of the shoulder, then it is appropriate that one sling be placed under its elbow and another against the break towards the arm's bend.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly, if there is a fracture near the elbow: then it must be arranged that a ligament is placed above that place, and over the arm itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then an equal fracture with ease and without effort, until the faster is balanced as it should be, and a good treatment is applied: then bind it tightly, unless hot pus occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 But if indeed there occurs hot pebylic stricture until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 And place on the above a soaked woolen cloth imbibed in vinegar and rose oil, until when the pustule rests: then bind it: and the manner of binding is to place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then place an unrolling from new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then gather the arm over support itself and place his open hand over his upper arm.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 And place the cloth and bind it over the arm support so that the arm stands in place of the stars: if nothing prevents you from it, nor does anything change for you above the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 But if it happens that something is changed over you from the broken bone, then use the stars: and this is to place on top of the same star that is wider and stronger than the rest of the stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And place between every star the width of the finger: and be the length of the stars according to the broken bone with an addition of three fingers from all sides.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then bind over the stars the tightening that I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it is to be your binding on top of the place of the broken bone firmer.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And as much more the broken bone stretches out, let there be a lighter binding.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 But if indeed you see the position of the stars and the binding as we said, at the time when you immediately restore the limb, then do: and if hot pebylic stricture occurs, then release the binding and the stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the ligament for all three days so that itching does not occur at the place, or swelling, or food is prevented from reaching the limb due to the position of excessive tightening.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Thus corrects everything as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If indeed you are reliable, so that nothing occurs from it: then do not loosen the ligament unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 And let the sick person sleep on their back, and their hand over their belly; and place a fully filled wool cushion under them evenly with help.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 And consider at all hours of the night or day that the shape of the broken bone does not loosen and that the ligament is softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Thus corrects everything with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 And place food for the sick person according to the order we have mentioned so that it is subtle food first until their mouth tightens; then it must be that they eat thickened food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For it is the custom of assistance and for the leg to be tightened for forty days: then indeed it must be loosened, given a bath, and treated with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the fracture were dirty, cleanse it: then do not loosen the ligament and staples until fifty days and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 ¶ On healing a bone fracture of the arm.
Caput XIII.	 Head XII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is composed of two bones called ulna and radius.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One of which is longer: and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is larger, and it is that which is placed under the little one from its lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore the larger bone breaks easily alone, or the smaller one: and perhaps they break at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 Whenever therefore the upper part of a fracture is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the lower part of a fracture breaks, that fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And worse it is, when two bones break simultaneously.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 But if the bone that is broken has little above it be easy, then it behoovangs physicians to attend its restoration, so as to place an extension easily until it heals.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 But if indeed that which is broken is large and easy: then one ought to place a stronger binding very firmly.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it behooves to place the hand's form in its restoration and the stretching of itself upon cushions.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all other fingers: and let the jointed be lower than all other fingers, or others: and the weak sitting squared over itself, and have cushions before it, or in line with its height, so that not a laborious infirmity may occur.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then let the servant stretch the arm from the lower part, or with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another minister stretches similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the physician straightens the bone until he restores it to as good a form as possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 Which if in the bone's fracture there are splinters, then strive to reduce every fragment to its place with your own strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 But if indeed a separate splinter appears and pricks the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration with you: then find above it, and remove it according to the method which we have mentioned before these prefaces.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 But if indeed the fucture is with a wound, I have already made this separate chapter, therefore take the healing from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 Which if in the beginning of your restoration a suppurate wound occurs, then line cloth with warm pitch made from rosary oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and fineness: and stretch the cloth over the delicate binding, until when the suppuration is set: then remove the wax, and place an ointment prepared from mill dust and egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place stars and let the star placed over the fracture itself be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of stars for the arm is six when arranged in multiple positions: if it's a fracture in one bar or two bars at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place your splint over the stronger and more intense part of the fracture, and much closer to either the upper or lower part of the fracture: or place a somewhat softer splint than that, according to what was mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And let there be cloths covering the fracture, soft and moist: and they should not be hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread used for binding be made of linen itself, a medium between fine and coarse, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 And consider the limb and the tendon after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 That if something occurs which requires correction, such as itching that happens to the limb: then one must embrocate the limb with heated water until the itch subsides, and release the unbandaged limb, until it rests; then repeat the splinting.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 That if the bandage is already softened, and the bone is already removed, and such like: then correct that whole thing with your strength, and examine it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the excessive bandage: then you must soften it somewhat, and release it for a few days, until it reaches nourishment; then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 If however nothing of that kind occurs which we have mentioned to the weakened person: then it is not necessary for it to be dissolved, unless after nineteein days or so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then hang the sickly hand on his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And his neck shall be balanced, and he should guard himself against violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 Let him lie down on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 And know that this fracture will be restored in thirty days or perhaps in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 It is all according to the constitutions and temperaments.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 ¶ Regarding the restoration of hand fractures.
Caput XIIII.	 Head XVII. (Note: The numbering 'XIV
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that rarely does a fracture occur in the hand's phalanges and knuckles.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 And it happens to him not except by frequent friction.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 Whenever the sole of the foot is fancied or friction, then it must be that he lies supine with the affected area elevated evenly and in balance.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then lay his hand on an extended surface.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Next the attendant extends the broken bones and joins them with proper healing until they are adequately united.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it must be that a bandage and plaster should be placed unless hot swelling occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place the pillow above according to the size of the location, and now you have already enveloped it with linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 But if the fracture is around near the lower part of the foot, then make a similar sphere from cloth: and instruct the patient to place it with his broken sole: then it is fastened with long linen.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And the pillow shall be of leather where there is flexibility so that it can be applied to skin with the sole: and fasten it as required.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 But if the fucture is on the outside, then it should be that you place a pillow above and another below at the footbed: and keep the hand open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then place a binding as usual for turning hands: and extend between fingers with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 "If there is a fracture to any finger joints, then if it is the thumb, they should be set as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 "Then it is bound with a bandage; and if one wishes to immobilize it, place therein a straight stick or rod, so that the fcuature may be set, and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 "If the fracture is in any other fingers, such as the middle, index, ring, or little finger, then it should be set and bound with a healthy adjacent finger that follows it; or they can all be tied together according to their sequence; this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 "Or place upon it a thin rod as we mentioned for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 "And consider this in your treatment; and after the application of a warm poultice: then apply what is needed therewith when something arises from it, according to its course.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 "§ On the healing of hip fractures.
Caput XV.	 "Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 "The pelvis often breaks and is characterized by this: because it turns to the inner and back parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 "And its restoration is such that above the break it is tied with a ligament, and another ligament below the break.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 "And the weak one should be propped up on his own face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 "Then every attending ligament stretches to its side by equal measures; and this when there is a break in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 "If however there is a break near the root of the pelvis, then one ligament to the side of the pubic bone so that extension falls upward: and another ligament below the break.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 "And thus similarly if there is a break near the knee, then one ligament close to the knee so that extension falls downward.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 "Then the physician sets both bones with his own hands until he restores it to its resemblance of its natural shape: and joins the bone together by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then it is necessary to place a plaster and a bandage, if no suppuration occurs in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess occurs there: then release it for several days, until the suppuration becomes warm, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 However, let that bandage be so.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary to apply a linen strip over the hard-set fracture, that is, a bandage; and two of it twice or thrice: and let there be an excess remaining from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then apply the linen strip to the leg, until it reaches the heel near the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee to the lower side, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper parts of both limbs.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then roll it over the leg and the hip with the excess from the linen strip.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place on the hip at the site of its own stakes, and place one of them over the shin bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill with dampness between the leg and the hip with soft cloths so that it equalizes with the bandage.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then start by fixing the strong bandage from the middle over the site of the break with three rolls or four.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as much longer you extend with the cord from the place of the break, let your bandage be smaller and softer, and lighter.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then approach to the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Thus tie with both three stakes that are above them. (Note: The Latin text provided seems to be incorrect or incomplete, as "tres astellas" does not make sense in
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then proceed with the two lower ends of the thread until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And also tighten both endings and again with the stakes on one side, so that the cord is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then release the bandage over that area while remaining, so that no ulceration occurs in the limb, nor an abscess, nor swelling, or similar things therein.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 In case something happens from it.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Therefore, approach this with its solution and correct everything that happened thereafter as we have often said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If indeed there is a piece of bone shattered from the bone that pierces: then it should be leveled by you if possible.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, find above it and remove that; and care for the person to whom it occurred until healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, apart from adding to it small pieces as we have said with an assistant and a strap.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, during its restoration, such broken things do not cause lameness.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if it is restored alone, apart from applying to it a second leg, then it is necessary for him whose it is to always be lame.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And you know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or it adds little, or decreases little: all this depends on different temperaments and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 ¶ Regarding the restoration of a broken ankle.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that a fracture of the ankle's knee rarely happens but often by rubbing against it.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 If indeed a fracture happens to it, then only a crack or hole within its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And it is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 And it stands above that completely with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 And its restoration is as follows: it becomes equal to what was broken from its parts with fingers, until joined together, and united according to what is possible by proportion and ease, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then place a plaster from the flour of Sisam (a type of millet), or mill, with egg white: and place over it a round strap if you find that one: and bind above that suitable strapping to this.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the arrangements that we have described in previous fractures: such as a hot boil, and similar things: so that you oppose every accident with whatever is suitable for it until healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 On restoring the broken leg.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter amo.untenseventeenth
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that there are two bones of the leg, one is thick and named by its kind as the thigh (Crus), and the other is slender and called Shinbone (Femur).
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And it happens to both kinds of fractures as with the two bones of the arm: and because of this, its restoration is made like that of the arm's equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 That if both bones are broken at once, the thigh (Crus) turns to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if the slender bone is fractured, the thigh (Crus) converts to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 And if the thick bacteria are broken, you find it below: and it is among those that do not hide from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then apply extension, and adjustment, and the binding of wires similarly equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However, it is necessary if the leg's fracture has many dirty wounds (septic): so that there should be less extension and your relief milder.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And indeed the operation on the leg is somewhat above that of the arm: and it is as when you put equal wires in your work with sun shades, which are placed under boards: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose among them those who have small thickness, and are not too fine. And their length should be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then wrap over both skins with two folds according to their length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 And place one part of the shank on one side from the upper knee to below the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then tie two bandages at three places, from both ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For since constriction is forbidden, the shank slopes to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And indeed it would be provided with a cradle from wood according to the length of the shank, and placed in such a way that it preserves itself from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 And indeed it is very important to make this when the fracture is accompanied by its own wound.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the shank every day and study it carefully with regard to the end of swelling or inflammation, or any other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If therefore something happens from those, then oppose to it with what is needed, until healed, if God wills so.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 About the fracture of bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 However, not a complete fracture of the heel has occurred.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 However, a fracture of the foot bones occurs sometimes, and also a slight fracture of the fingers: and it does not occur to them except friction in several dispositions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 That if a fracture of the foot bones occurs and you see that those bones raise themselves above their own swelling to some extent, then the sick should place his foot over the prepared ground as walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand still and place your foot over that which is elevated from those bones: afterwards press it, or strike it with the heel; and let it remain equal until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then place a paste, and a band above: and place under the foot a thin board with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then tie it tightly with a suitable constriction after you have warmed it with bandages and other things it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 Therefore, when three or four days have passed by, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For if you find even bones, whether they are broken or displaculed.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 Therefore the operation is as follows, which you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 But if some fingers are broken, then restore them and straighten the same according to what you have described for restoring the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place your own splint according to the length of the finger, and it should be a little wider; then place underfoot this table that you described, and tie it with an appropriate bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 But if what is broken consists of two or three or more bones, then place over the entire finger a splint of its quantity in linen cloth; and tie the table at the bottom of the foot: and let it stand on one head of the table outside the lower part of the foot so that it may hold good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 And it is fitting for you not to forget that you should consider everything I have said to you regarding the remaining broken things from accidents which we have discussed: and apply each remedy with what is suitable.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 § On the fracture of the woman's vulva, and the bone of the pelvis, and the thighbone of a man.
Caput XIX.	 Head 1e.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When the woman's vulva is broken, then make it sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then lean her towards her own back somewhat, and she should be held behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then the midwife shall fill its own womb with cotton until it is filled; and let it be made in the vulva as a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then shake the woman, and support her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For indeed that cotton is expelled until it becomes before the vulva as a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a poultice on his back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 Whenever he wishes to urinate, remove the catheter with ease, then let him urinate; and return it according to the method by which you first inserted it; then let him go back to his poultice.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Do this for seven days or so, because the mouth is restored in this manner.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take a sheath on the mouth and tie a cord over its hole with a reed tube, then insert the entire sheeht into his urethra.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow gently into the tube until it inflates inside the urethra, for this way a rupture is healed.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then fill with cotton and let it stay for several days as we have said, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the pelvic bone of a man or woman is broken, then apply this remedy for its restoration, and also that proportion we have mentioned in the healing of a skull fracture.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And do not neglect the anus near these fractures that are somewhat close together, especially those having something to do with study or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 And understand this book of mine much, for the fracture itself signifies to you many ways towards a straight path in its restoration and constriction: therefore understand it.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 When the wing of a man is broken, take the neck of a goose; and insert the wing into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place a swelling on top of it from cloth and let it be inflamed; then release it for about three days or so, and it will heal if God wishes.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 Of the restoration of a bone fracture when there is also an ulcer.
Caput XX.	 Head XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is suitable for him whose fracture has occurred with an ulcer, especially if it is large like the hip bone or its assistants, and similar to those, such as properies, and phlebotomists himself immediately: if the conditions of phlebotomy are shown to you, as we have mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If a wound is flowing blood, then one should hasten to cut it off so that you rub powdered lime on top of it; if nothing else is present.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin repairing the fracture on that same day: and do not delay this, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 However, if a hot abscess occurs, then postpone the repair until the ninth day so that the abscess may settle.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach it on the third or fourth day at all, for you will bring about unfortunate events to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 But if the broken bone is protruding over the skin detected: then you should aim to reduce it, and make sure that your hands are able to do so with ease and slight pressure.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 But if there is no extension of it, and adjusting it with your hands: then reduce the bone using this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And an instrument that is made of iron, whose length corresponds to the size of seven or eight fingers: and its width according to the amount of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And because of this it is necessary for the physician to receive from them three or four according to the amount he needs for that kind of treatment regarding any type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And it should be round; and its thickness small so that it does not double upon itself when compressed over the wound during surgery: and it should have a border on its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And its upper part should be as thick as half of its total thickness down to the lower end.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It should be placed during this operation that its sharp end is bent over the protruding bone edge: and push it in with one tool until when the bone returns and reaches an equal position.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 So try to equalize the edges of the fracture accordingly.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the ends of it are fractured in a subtle way and does not accept them by proper treatment, then you must cut into that bone until the tool has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If indeed you cannot reduce them as we have described at all, then incise it with the instrument that is suitable for him from those incisors we mentioned: or saw it with a single saw of whatever kind is possible to you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then scrape off that which remains on the bone due to roughness and small cortexes.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 But when the bone is reduced and finds that it has a very severe pain after the reduction of its weakness, then you know that the bumps have not returned to their natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	 Do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you are dealing with a large weakness in the patient when completing your restoration of the bone which you do.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then immerse the bandage in astringent black wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And properly if it is summer. (This seems to be an incomplete sentence or fragment from the original text.)
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place a greasy dressing on the wound, nor anything that has oil in it: so that it does not happen to decay and rot.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer astillas at your time of completion of the bone restoration. (Note: "astillas" is unclear in this context; it may refer to an ancient treatment using crushed substances, but without additional
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And dismiss the detected wound: so that you cut with forceps a hole according to the amount of the wound. (Note: The reference to "incidens" and "forceps" suggests an incision or excision procedure, but this is speculative without further medical context.)
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And beware of every precaution, not to tighten the wound with a fracture. (This sentence advises against applying pressure or dressing that may exacerbate a fractured area
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For they have done this foolishly often: and made it happen to their own sick people either death or decay or pustules, that is, health. (Note: This translation appears nonsensical; the phrase "id est, saniem" does not translate directly to "health." It's possible there may be a misunderstanding in the term "zuchem," which is unclear and may require further clarification or context for an accurate translation.)
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And your ligature should be soft, gentle, a diverse rupture of other broken bones.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or it is a large wander and you encounter some adverse events that we have mentioned, and you find pain in a hanging place: then it should not be placed with spikes over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And do for them contractions from hard cloths at the place of spikes, and bind it tightly with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 However, if it is after one day or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove above the cloth that was placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then apply a liniment and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as the four-drug salve and similar things.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it suits you to dissolve the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 And observe the wound at every morning and evening until it is healed and cured.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 And it should be prepared so that the limb runs with pus to the lower parts easily.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If many wounds are passing and it is not healing, nor does the pcu separate from it: then you should know that there are slight bone fractures.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, you must examine the wound with probing.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 However, how many of them are separated: remove those and extract it (the pus).
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those of them that are not separated and puncture the limb and cause pain, try to make them fall out, and remove them in every possible way you can do it.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If it happens that the wound is swollen or aired (leaks), that is, it has an outpouching, or other types of corruption and putrefaction: then you should apply to each of them with what suits him from treatment, according to which was explained in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And from this, to make my speech stay, and whom you should have in mind when a bone is broken, and protrudes over the limb, as with the pelvis of the hip, and helpers, and similarities from large limbs, it is so that you do not presume its attraction; for often enough many deaths occur from this, indeed let it go until putrefaction.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps after ninetee or thirty days, it may fall off by itself.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then indeed care for the wound if you see it: but otherwise let it go.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 § For curing a nodule in the sign of bone fracture.
Caput XXI.	 Head XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 Often this Nodulation occurs in the sign of bone fracture healing.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Especially, that which is near joints: and feeds from its shape on the body.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural action.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Consider then, if the Nodulation is recent: apply therein remedies that have astapecticity, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar substances from them.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 So that you may receive from these certain ones or all of them: and make them with astringent wine, or with albuminous milk, or with vinegar: and place them over the Nodulation on cotton wool, and tie them tightly over the same bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And loosen the bandage, do not remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then dissolve it and apply another one, until the Nodulation is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or tie over the same thin sheet of lead impartially.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For Lead indeed has a property to remove all that is feared from limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If however the Nodulation is already turned into stone and tightened, and urgently provokes necessity for removal of it: then cut over it from its upper part, and scrape off any excess that protrudes: or shave it with certain rasors until removed; care for it, until healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 "Concerning healing when it is restored, and a member remains delicate, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 "When a bone is restored and the member remains delicate afterward, then it does not happen for no reason but due to many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 "One of the reasons is an excessive flow from ligament dissolution and its improper binding, which prevents nourishment from reaching the limb; or due to an overabundance of embrocation applied at inappropriate times; or because of a scarcity of blood within the sickly body, leading to weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 "And therefore, healing it involves nourishing the sick body and making its form tender until blood increases therein.
Et administra balneum.	 "And apply a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 "And instill joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 "Then place pitch on the limb, so that it will draw in a great deal of nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 "And apply embrocation to its wound with warm water continually, until the nourishment flows and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 "Regarding healing bone fractures when they are restored twisted.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 "When after the healing of a limb that has been restored and then shows twisting or prominence at the fractured bone or nodding, yet it is disfigured in form; however, the member does not prevent itself from its natural action: therefore, you should not accept the speech asserting that it will cause the body part to break again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 "And there have been many foolish doctors and healers who have done this here on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 "And indeed, this operation is highly blameworthy and leads to death or great fear that it is mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 "However, if the limping and nodding are recent: then you should embrocate with warm water in which soaked herbs that soften have been cooked, such as leaves of yarrow, its root, and mallows, among others.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And let an ointment be made with a soothing plaster, as done with diachylon properly.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Or be rubbed the mucilage of the root of althea and mixed with hen's fat or sesame oil; and it should be plastered with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or take rubefacient figs and mix them with white clay from doves, and such things called medicines that reduce hardness.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And at times the knot is loosanno with constant, old-fashioned and gentle friction, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 And it should be administered movement to all parts of the limb at every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 But if the twist has already progressed, and it is strong and turned into stone, and there is a need for treatment with iron: then one should cut above that, and dissolve the continuation of the bone, and cut off what protrudes from the knot or bone with delicate incisors: and administer ease in that with carefulness and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 Of speech in dislocations.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 A dislocation is the outcome of certain joints being out of their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it prevents movement and spoils the figure of the limb.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes severe pain to occur in the weakened body, and acute injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 When therefore a dislocation occurs, then one must hasten to its restoration: do not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if delayed, the place is inflamed and perhaps with it again bringing back of the dislocated bone.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore for this reason one should not move it, nor lengthen it at the hour of its inflammation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 For often it causes convulsions to occur, and injurious pains.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 But when this happens, then one should hasten towards bleeding the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it is dismissed until the abscess rests.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then the limb is bathed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then it is reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And heal the entire limb as if nothing had happened.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 Indeed, I have already set out chapters on dislocations, even as they occurred according to their position from the upper part of the body downwards.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 § On treating lower mandible dislocation.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 2flyɪkt. (This phrase doesn'
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two jaws are seldom displaced little. (The original Latin text is not clear, a better translation may be needed based on the context or with access to
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 And the displacement of the joints occurs in one of two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Or indeed they return to their places by slight dislocation and are softened only slightly. (This phrase is still not clear due to possible errors in the original Latin text; it might require access to the full context or corrections of any potential transcription mistakes for an accurate translation
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Or they are displaced by a complete dislocation, remain so until softened to the chest part, when the sick person cannot hold it and cannot close their mouth, and their tongue is protruded with speech. (This translation assumes some corrections in the Latin text for accuracy)
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When however the displacement of it is slight, then it returns to several positions by itself with little effort. (Again assuming corrections are needed for accurate translation)
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If however it is a complete and integral displacement: then one must immediately administer reduction, and not delay completely; and it should be as the minister holds the head of the sick person: and the doctor inserts his single finger into the root of the mandible dislocation between the bones if the dislocation is from one side. (This assumes corrections in Latin text for accuracy)
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or he inserts his two fingers at once if the displacement is from both sides. (Again assuming potential errors need to be corrected for accurate translation.)
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And all other fingers of his hand should lie outside those which make it even. (This assumes corrections in Latin text may be needed)
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And instruct the sick person to cleanse their jawbones and make them ready for chewing on all sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the doctor straightens the jawbone and pushes it until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If it is difficult to reduce that one: especially if both jawbones are involved at the same time; then administer a poultice with hot water and oil, so that the reduction of the jaws becomes easy: do not delay the reduction of the jaws in any way, as we have mentioned.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 As they are returned and straightened, and the wound is closed but not soothed: then place poultices made of cloth on them, with a plaster that is made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it should be bound gently with soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 Then the sick person should have sleep on their back: and their head be kept between two poultices so that it does not move to the right or left: nor shall they be forced or urged to chew something: indeed let them eat a gentle food, until when pains subside and jaw heals: then may they eat what they desire, and administer this easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 They should not work during eating and drinking, and resting until the jaw sets rightly and heals.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of both jawbones is difficult when they dislocate at some time and do not return to their places: then many times fevers occur from it, and frequent perspiration: and sometimes the sick person's throat clears up, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 As you see this: then know that it is a loss, and often the person who experiences this dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 On reducing a fracture of the forearm, and the end of the shoulder. (Note: The text appears to start discussing another topic not directly related to jawbones or mandibles
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 2cu.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 Chapter 67. The clavicle is indeed not dislocated from the inner side because of its continuous connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 And it can sometimes be dislocated outwardly; and that fact is explained as follows.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 And its restoration involves lying down on one's back weakly while extending the arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then compress it with your hand firmly because that will cause it to return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Next, place over the wound plaster, and bandages, and bind them tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 However, his extremities that follow the elbow continue with it, are not usually dislocated unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 Which if dislocated on some day: then it should be reduced and made even as we mentioned, and what you have prepared for yourself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place over the wound plaster, bandages, and compresses.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And instruct the patient to maintain calmness and rest until healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with this same treatment the upper arm is reduced when separated from its place as well.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 § Regarding the reduction of humerus dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 The first of which is when it dislocates toward the lower side.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second is when it dislocates towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And sometimes it can dislocate to the upper part of the humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 And it does not dislocate towards the back because of the scapula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it does not dislocate to the front because of nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 Indeed, most commonly dislocated and comes out towards the lower side against the scapula: especially in those whose muscles are few.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 For it emerges quickly from them and enters just as swiftly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 However, in those whose wounds contain many pieces of flesh, the opposite is true, that is to say, it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps this has happened to certain people due to a blow or accident, and the humerus is affected by heat swelling, and it is thought because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, you must try to verify this until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 And the dislocation is known when it is turned from lower to upper; and you distinguish between a dislocated humerprise and a healthy humeroprise.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you have found great differences among them, and you find concavity in the head of the humeroprise, and under the upper part upon touching, the head of the humeroperceives almost as if it were an eye: and he cannot move his hand to his ear with a weak force, nor by any motion.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if it is displaced toward the chest or upward: then you find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And this very dislocation can be easily reduced when it is recent, or the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 And its reduction is as if to guide his hand upward.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then put your thumbs under the upper part of it, and guide the connection with strength upward to its place: and let him guide his hand, and stretch it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 And then he puts it lower, for indeed it returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 But if it does not return by the method we have said, and there are many days since its occurrence: then he must bathe weakly in warm water, and apply an embrocation that softens and soothes, as if decoctions of high roots, fenugreek, and mellilotus were put into water, and applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then the sick person is laid down on their back: and it is placed under a ball of tickling with wool that has equal qualities of gentlenamo and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor places his heel on top of the ball, and lifts the head of the forearm with strength, and pulls the hand of the sick person towards the lower part.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another servant holds the head of the sick person so that it does not move downwards: for he himself immediately stands up straight.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you are able, guide him back according to this method: and it is as though he makes himself present among men who are taller than the sick person, stands on his side, and inserts his arm underne. The doctor then lifts the tickling of the sick man upwards until the sick man is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another servant pulls the hand of the sick person towards the lower part of his sides.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 But if the sick person is light: then it must be so that he hangs with something else attached to him, causing slight pain: for there will be an immediate dislocation.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And he is also guided according to another method: and it is as though a long piece of wood, whose top is round like the neck of an amphora, is made; so that it is neither too thick nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then it is placed under the sick person after being placed over the top of the wood with light cloths: and the sick person stands according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then his hand is extended towards the lower part from one side, and his body extends with strength on the other side: for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If it is difficult to reduce him by all the things we mentioned, then use this care: and it is as though you take a piece of wood whose length equals the quantity of two arms, its width equals the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness equals the quantity of two fingers; with a round top that will ease his entry into depths of tickling according to this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then loose bands are tied above the round head with soft cloths so as not to harm the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then a splint is placed under the weakened joint so that the hand or arm can be extended to touch the wood downwards; and the wood is fastened over the support and the arm, as well as the extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then the arm is placed over the width of the ladder step and extended downwards with the hand; the remaining hanging body is let go from one side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 The joints, however, are immediately united.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 Whenever the entrance is thus completed by any means possible: then it must be that you place under a similarly sized sponge made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place an applied plaster prepared from ground mill powder mixed with frankincense, and whole almond milk over the entire upper arm, as it reappears from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then tighten a suitable bandage under the splint: and untie the band over the plaster from above; then attach that hand to its neck, and let it hang without moving for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 And you must place food under the weakened limb until strength is restored to the body; for it speeds up its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then place a larger splint after seven or five days, and begin with movement exercises.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If it therefore firms up and does not soften, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If however the joint dislocates many times, due to moisture occurring on it or due to another cause: then you must administer therein a caustic with three holes, as was previously explained in the chapter about caustics.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If all this is done and the ligament dissolves after seven days, and the joint does not solidify again, and the plaster and bandage are repeatedly removed from it, and do not firm up again, and it falls off without being able to heal at all: then know that the nerves of its head-shoulder which have been cut or stretched out or softened. And know that the joint will never fit in its original place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 Concerning dislocation that occurs towards the chest and nipple, or to posterior reduction, it is made with a push and extension using hands: until it returns, and the remaining strapping and treatment is applied, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If after healing there is heaviness in the limb and a delay in its movement, then use weakened baths many times, until that heaviness subsides, and it returns to its original state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 On curing of elbow disloc cuffs.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 Know that a joint elbow dislocation occurs with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty as well: and the dislocation itself happens towards all sides, especially towards the front or back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And that dislocation is not hidden from you: because it falls under sight, and touch, according to whatever shape it becomes dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when a joint elbow with a dislocation occurs alongside healthy, it is declared clearly to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 The joint indeed hinders, and the arm cannot double, nor can touch its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary that you act quickly, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot suppuration occurs to him.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if it happens that he has a hot suppuration, his reduction is difficult: and perhaps does not heal at all, especially when towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For it is worse in all types of dislocations, and stronger pain for them: and often decreases with that death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the restoration of that when it is as much possible to reduce from them, is: as to extend their hand with two hands: and for their arm to be expanded, and doctors' hands above the elbow and below it, and he himself pushes the joint with his thumbs simultaneously or with the root of his palm, until returning to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 On the other hand, a dislocation is in front of [something]: then it returns so that it doubles its hand with its own hand, until it strikes with the root of its palm hand the elbow that is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not comply with reduction, then administers a strong and intense extension: and it is as if two assistants extend the arm, and they hold it also with two assistancii so that it may not slip during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm is revolved to its whole side after being wrapped with a double-layered long cloth or a wide bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the doctor touches the joint with his own hand, he anoints it with oil; so that there be something from them which aids in the lubrication of the joint and its ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then he drives the joint with a strong push until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 And after its reduction, it ought to be placed over the same poultice, where there is styptic and coagulation with milky-white substance; and it is tightly bound according to decorum.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 And let the arm be hung from the neck of the patient: and released after several days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then it is dissolved.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If therefore the joint remains strong at its place, then loosen the bandage from there and release it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see that the joint is not well bound, then repeat the poultice and bandage, and release it for several days until it becomes tightly bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then dissolve it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If however there is heaviness after the reduction of the joint and it is in motion: then administers moistening in bathing, gentle friction, and compression until smoothness occurs, or place over the joint bandage, that is, sheep's milk ice cream.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then bind it up, and release it for one day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it and insert it into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 Once it has sweat, then apply the dry bandage moistened with ointment.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then repeat over her wound with a single oil, and again, and the third time after bathing, until soothing occurs.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if there is an ulcer, place over her wound a moistened gauze with melted butter, and tightly cover it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 For this reason she is soothed, and returns to her normal state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 § On the treatment of Almahassem's displacement.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter amoebiasis.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 Amebiasis occurs in the hand multiple times, that is, the joint between the arm and hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 And its reduction is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 On the other hand, remaining joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, it is important that the speed of its reduction be timely at the hour when the displacement occurs, before an inflammamen develops: or if a hot swelling occurs.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 And the reduction of displacement is such that you place Mahassem's affected hand on a board, and extend it with your own hand: and the doctor places his palm over the protrusion of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, it must be considered if the palm has already withdrawed to the forearm: then place the back of his hand on a board at extension and reduction: and if the displacement is progressing towards the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be internally over the board, that is, the interior part of his hand placed on top of the board so that the doctor's hand falls upon its protrusion joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If therefore it returns immediately, good: and if not, then tightly bind it with a soothing plaster for the swelling: and let it be released, neither repeat that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 Indeed, if it cannot be tolerated and you are unable to perform the reduction after a certain period has passed, the joint remains according to its own curvature; and nothing harms the patient except that it softens the hand, and is unable to grasp anything: then you know that the nerves have been cut or worn away.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 Therefore, there is no skill in this unless it can be tightened with a caustic near the site.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps it does not provide any benefit at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 And so when Almuhasib is not returned, then place the ointment over that plaster as we mentioned.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then it is tightened and removed after five days: afterwards released and moved, and the hand exercises.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 But if the movement is reduced and something serious happens therein: then gently treat it with warm water and friction several times until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Regarding the treatment of finger dislocangs.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated to any of its parts, or from the back of its palm, or its ventral side: then extend that finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then support the head of the digit, suspend that finger towards the side to which it has been dislocated, and let it go for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then hang that digit and extend it until it is straight on its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 And when night falls, bind that digit according to the same instructions; and do not cease to release it during the day: exercise it with movement; and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do this for several days until it tightens up.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And do the same with it if it is dislocated to the ventral side of the hand: and bind that digit to its own part, and perform on it your first operation until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And similarly, when it is dislocated to the remaining parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 § On the treatment of spinal disc displacement (Spondylolisthesis).
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When one experiences spinal disc displacement or complete neck dislocation and many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no treatment for it, as death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And a sign of this is that the sick person leaves defecation without will and cannot hold it; and often they are softened by some of his limbs, or both shanks, or two arms of himself, or one of them: or a vertebra is displaced from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 Often it is displaculed because often there is dislocation to the four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 Therefore, that which is displaced toward the back is called kyphosis (humpback).
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 However, the treatment for it is that you consider at that time if kyphosis occurs from childhood: then there is no treatment for it and not even any cure at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 However, in that which occurs from accident or by striking, the ancients have already described various treatment methods in lengthy speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 The majority of whom do not return with a good outcome.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 However, I have already made a brief version of it, which is far from the one very close to me in intention: and because of my explanation about this, and forming the instrument of it differently than what they showed it, and how they explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, I say that in kyphosis which occurs from the front part, there is no intelligence and not even any cure at all.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly also in those which occur to both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not treated from them unless those which occur in the back properly, as I narrate: and it is that he should be extended over his face on a flat base near to a wall: and an underclothes made of moist fabric should be stretched out so that his chest would not be hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then a straight piece of wood should be fixed in the furrow in the ground, at the head of one foot [of the patient], and another piece of wood about as long as that first, at the other end of the patient's foot: and let an assistant hold the wood, so that it is not firmly fixed in the furrow.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And let a second assistant hold the other [piece].
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then make a tourniquet around the patient's head, and under the soft tissue of his temple bone, tightly; and extend the end of the ligament to the wood that is at the head: and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then make another tourniquet over his arches, and above his knees, and near his heels.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the ligaments, and tie them onto the other wood that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then all assistants should stretch towards the wood the entire ligament; however, do not remove the two pieces of wood from their places where they are fixed: but ensure that they are not too tightly set, as we have said before.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the doctor should place his hands over the spinous process with strength, until it returns; or place them on a table.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he should attach his feet to the table, until they return.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 But if it does not return by this treatment, then take a table whose length is about three arms long.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And cut into the wall that we mentioned which is near the patient, a place where the end of the table can be inserted.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then put the middle part of the table over the spinous process.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And let the doctor place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And tie it tightly, until the spinous process is bent, and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then if you can, operate with the tourniquet that has been wound with your hand; and it is as follows, make two pieces of wood in the ground near the head of the patient whose length is equal to one arm: and at his head, another two pieces ofwoo.d
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And let the length between every piece of wood be one handbreadth; and now a hole has been made everywhere where the tube runs through it: and firmly secure all the wood on the ground so that it may not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And a round piece of wood is inserted; and there is a tube in which the tendon can run through two holes of the two pieces ofwood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at the end of it there is a hole wherein the wood is fastened, whose length is one handbreadth as it bends; and similarly with two other pieces of wood.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then, secure the tendons that you have tied on the sick man's chest at the head part of the tube; and also secure the tendons that you have tied on his shanks at the foot part of the tube.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then stand at every tube joint with the helper who turns his hand using the lever as it bends through the tube; and the physician adjusts the spine as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of the tube that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 After the physician returns and adjusts the position, then you must place an ointment of clarified butter with albumen on it.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then use wool.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Afterward, place above the ointnent an astrolabe from a tablet whose width be of three fingers or approximately so.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And the length and quantity that it occupies at the place of humpiness, and above the healthy part of the spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then secure with a tendon as we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And let the sick one be fed on subtle nourishment until he is cured.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 And if there remains something of prominence at the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that they administer medicines that soften and soothe with the application of a tablet as I have mentioned over a long period of time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now it is administered with a thin sheet of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 And sometimes an elevation occurs at the end of the dorsal spine; and it is thought to be a dislocation through it, and that bone protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Why should not this assumption be made about him with this medicine: perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 ¶ Concerning the treatment of a displaced anchovy bone. (Note that 'anchae' seems to be a misinter
Caput XXXII.	 Head LXXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the joints of an anchovy and the shoulder joint do not occur except as a mere dislocation: nor is it like other remote joints displaced by slight compression and hollowing out. (The term 'anchae' here is also likely a misinterpretation, but the Latin text speaks about "iuncturae," which can refer to anatomical joints.)
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 And indeed the anchovy's joint is dislocated in four parts. (Again, 'anchae' seems out of context here; if referring to a body part, it might be an error as Latin typically uses 
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 This is because it is dislodged towards the front and back. (This sentence may not make sense with 'anchae,' suggesting that there could be a misinterpretation of
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 And it is mainly displaced inwardly: and only slightly towards the front and back. (The term 'anchae' seems to be a misinterpretation or mistranslation of some body part.)
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 And the treatment of its inward dislocation is as follows: because when you join the sound leg with the infirm one, it becomes longer; and its knee is more prominent than that of a healthy person, and the infirm cannot double his foot beside the groin; there is also a place following the inguinal hollowing which has been affected by warmth, because already this condition has arrived here. (Again, 'anchae' likely does not fit; it may need context from adjacent sentences to understand what body part is being discussed.)
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 And the indication of its external displacement consists in opposite circumstances to these conditions. (The term 'anchae' seems incorrect and may need context or correction.)
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 And the indication of its displacement towards the front is that it expands the sound leg according to its complement; however, it does not double itself without pain in the knee: and if it attempts to walk, it cannot go beyond this dislocation towards the front: it retains urine, and there is hollowing around its groin, and walking causes pressure on its heel. (The term 'anchae' remains problematic and may need context or correction.)
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 And the sign of his dislocation towards the back is such that he cannot extend his knee or double it until after his groin has been folded; and his leg is also shorter on one side; and his groin is softened, and his hip is located at that place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 However, the reduction of these types of dislocangs is to consider that if it is an old dislocation, which has become chronic while endured by him.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you administer the reduction of it, and it remains according to its own disposition: then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, it should not be presumed completely against him.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In that case of his dislocation which is recent, and belongs to one of the four species of dislocations: then quickly attend to this, in order to warm up the joints, and extend it inside and outside, and move it right and left; for perhaps it returns, and does not require any other treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If however it does not return in this manner, then you should prepare a strong remedy, and extend his leg from the lower part: or with its own hands, or with a band that is tied over his thigh above the knee: and another minister extends his hand upwards so as to insert his fingers under his ticklish parts.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then bind with a soft band over the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And his extension should be either from the front part of the groin to the forequarter or from the back towards the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And all these extensions should be simultaneous until the sick person is lifted with his body off the ground and hangs suspended.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 For this kind of extension indeed belongs to the common type among the four species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If therefore his dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for each of those four kinds to be treated as I will say about their proper healing.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Indeed, in reducing it itself when there is a dislocation towards the inside, it must be that the sick person lies on their healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then place a ligament over the root of the hip bone, between the head of the hip and beneath the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the upper part of the body, towards the shoulder blade.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then receive another strong assistant his arms and reduce the large area of the sick hip, extending it vigorcuously outwards.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now then, he returns to his place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this is a simpler of the remaining treatment methods by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If however it is forbidden upon you, and does not obey you at all with this type of treatment: then one must bind two feet of the sick person together simultaneously with a strong ligament, gently, over both heels, and over both knees; and let the length be equal to that of four fingers from their companion. And let the sick leg be extended more than twice as much as the amount of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then suspend the sick person over the head of a beam, which is inside the house; and let its length be equal to twice as much as two arms from the ground.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then instruct a strong youth to guard the head of the hip; and be found with another person while suspended: and let one young man push the other, guarding the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 However, when reducing it itself for a dislocation towards the outside, one must let the sick person lie on a platform as we have mentioned with someone having a humpback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And the ligament is tied over his leg and to himself, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then place two beams, one at their feet and another at the head of themselves.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then a wooden plank should be placed added to the middle of the foot, securely fastened; over which wet cloths should be wrapped so as not to harm the patient: and the wood should be between his thighs, so that it is not pulled towards the lower part during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then each attendant should stretch out to their respective side, and the physician adjusts the alignment with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If it therefore returns, that would be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place over the same table and press on it as we discussed with lordotic posture evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, it is necessary that the patient lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it must be extended by the patient's leg quickly: and according to this same description over the footstool: and let the physe place his right hand palm over the groin of the patient.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then he shall fasten him with the other hand and with that same restraints place it extended towards the lower part of the knee joint.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 And if the discuplation is towards the back, then it does not need to be extended downwards, and should lie on the ground loosely: in fact, it needs to be placed over a hard surface, as we also said when it was dislocated outside of its ankles for its lying posture on two ankles: and is above his face, and with stretched ligaments: according to what we mentioned earlier.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 And it is necessary that compression with the table also be administered over the place where the joint dislocates, when completing the reduction as required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And do not hide the sign of its return from you: and it is as if to extend both legs of the patient: and when you see that they are equal, and the patient grips his leg and spreads himself without hesitation: then know that now the limb has returned as required: then join the two thigh cufflinks and place a bandage, and bind it tightly with an emmew (a kind of ointment), i.e., make sure it does not move in any part: and let the patient adhere to rest for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then dissolve the ligament and apply the ointment, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see that they are equal in position, then you will know that the dislocation has been set right; therefore allow the patient to walk again.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see some softening: then rinse it off and apply that ointpithe same as before; let go also for three days more.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then dissolve this and make the patient delay walking on each leg for two or three days until it is well-recovered.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 § On Knee Dislocangs.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The Knee is displaced in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is displacuated towards the outside (laterally), to the inside (medially) and to the bottom (posteriorly).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not displaced toward the front (anteriorly).
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 And a sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to apply their leg to their hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 But if it does not stick with the hip; then you will know that the Knee is displaced.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all forms of its dislocation is to make the patient sit upright so that already stretch out their leg if they can above it, and stick your back to their face; and place their foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then make the Knee of his stick with your hands, and straighten those fingers of yours over the Knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply with your palm on both sides of the Knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another helper extends their foot until the Knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 And a sign of its return is that the leg sticks with the hip gently and not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then apply an ointment to it, and make the leg stick with the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And then bind that simultaneously for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then dissolve it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And let the sick person not walk for several days until healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 However, if the reduction is refused by him, then you shall give a strong extension with ligatures, as described earlier in the treatment of ankles, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 § On treating the displacement of the heel bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel is sometimes knocked out by a small displacement, and at other times it is dislocated according to the prescribed regimen.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 And its dislocation occurs either towards the inner parts or towards the outer parts.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 And a sign of this dislocation is that you see the heel being swollen and tending towards the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 However, the treatment of this displacement is an easy reduction: and it is to be extended with ease by hand, and straightened until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 However, in its treatment when it is dislocated according to the regimen, you must make the sick person sit up straight: and let a strong assistant hold firmly from behind his back part, at the middle of that thing.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold with your right hand the foot of his from its upper part and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the place of the calf.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards you by your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Then with two ligatures on the left side.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then extend it further with your left hand and push the chest of the foot with your right hand towards the thigh without difficulty.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do this twice, as we have narrated.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the chest of the foot towards the thigh on the third vein, and you pull the calf.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If therefore it returns on the first or second vein according to this manner, and you see the foot being straightened, then that is good: but if not, then repeat the operation upon that thing: for it itself returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 However, if you are prevented from doing the reduction as we have described: then make the patient lie on his back on the ground and firmly prop a post in the ground, so that he may fall between his thighs; and now wrap yourself around it with your cloak, so that no harm comes to the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then let the attendant take hold of his thigh: afterwards stretch out the other leg by hand or with a band that is tied over its shinbone.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then let the whole attendant be extended against its opposite side: and the post stand between both thighangs of the patient, retaining him so that his body is not pulled towards the lower part at the point of extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then the physician straightens the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant holds the healthy leg from below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 For a dislocation recovers quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When the dislocation returns and health is declared to you again: then place a plaster and bandage on it, and tie it securely with strong bands, and bind the leg with a band to the thigh.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And it is necessary that you cut or tie off the nerves above the heel posteriorly, so that there be no band on them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then let him lie down for two days or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 But if the ligament is softened, tie him up again; then loosen him on the third or fourth day: and prevent the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 If he yet tries to walk before that period, no safety will come from it, for the dislocation is again loosened and corrupted, and does not recover after that treatment.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 But if a hot boil happens to him: then you must administer to his rest as it is described in another place of our treatment and rubbing, until it disappears.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 § On the displacement of toes of the foot and treatment.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that it be made to fit with little stretching and without difficulty: indeed this [process] is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 If however the dislocation is in some knots of the dorsal surface of the foot: then it must be made such that he makes his own injured foot sit on an equal place on the ground or a board; and [it] stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then stand up, and place your foot over that which is prominent among those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press down the heel with your foot, using strength, until it returns, and observe that it is already even, and not prominent in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then put a board under the injured foot which can support the entirety of the foot, having two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then bind this bandage firmly for three days well-appointed.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then loosen it and let him rest from walking for many days until it is firmly secured in place after the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 § On types of dislocations with ulcers or fractures.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When such a thing happens to it and one approaches its treatment, and the restoration of itself, very often death ensues: and for this reason it is not proper that one should presume over the treatment of this kind, unless he be prudent in long use of art, merciful, pious, slow, not daring, nor arrogant; and to apply hot medicines that soothe wounds only a little.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you see or hope for health from near destruction with ease of illness, and where there appears some sign of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore attempt then the reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot wound occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If the member returns as we wish, then apply a treatment that soothes inflammamation, and care for the wound with those dried ointments that are suitable for it.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If the dislocation is with a fracture and separated bone fragments occur, then attempt to remove them, and do as we have said in simple illnesses from what preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be cautious according to your strength, and guard yourself from the path of fear: according to what has followed my prediction for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For that is better with your Maker, and more enduring to glory for you, and more healthy for your body among them at your time.
