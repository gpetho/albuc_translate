The procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and thread a soft and fine silk thread through it; then bring the ends together and knot them both subtly, and the length of the threads should be one palm long;	If it be one or two hairs the operation will be to take a fine needle, thread it with a fine smooth silk, bring the ends together, and knot them with a tiny knot; the thread should be about a span in length.	0.81611884
then arrange in the instrument another short, fine silk thread, and knot the ends of the thread;	Then in the loop insert another fine thread, shorter than the first, and join the ends with a knot if you wish.	0.64767337
then have the patient put their head in your lap;	Then let the patient put his head in your lap in full sunlight, so that the operation may be clearly seen, because it is very fine work.	0.49667564
and be near the sun so that the work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate task, then insert the needle with the instrument at the root of the hair next to it, and pierce it through the caruncle quickly until you pull it out over the natural hair;	Then introduce the needle with the loop to the root of the superfluous hair and run it quickly through the eyelid till you make it come out above the natural hair.	0.55581135
then pull the hair up to the instrument, and insert that hair into the instrument, whether there is one or two or three or more;	Then draw the thread to the top of the loop and introduce that hair into the loop if it be one, two, or three, but not more.	0.6682005
then pull your hand so that the hair comes out with the instrument in the caruncle along with the natural hair.	Then draw away your hand with it until the hair emerges with the loop on the eyelid among the natural hair.	0.8100488
And if the instrument is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, then you will pull the instrument from below with the thread that you have arranged there, until the instrument comes out of the hole above and you see it with the vision of your eye;	If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, you draw the loop down by means of the thread which you have previously passed through it, until the loop comes out at the upper perforation. Then put the hair back in and draw them both up; keep on until the hair rises up in the upper perforation and you can see it.	0.71550363
then you will pull the instrument and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair is burned in its place and the flesh grows over it;	Then extract loop and thread and take them both out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days till the hair be fixed in its place and there is regeneration of flesh over it.	0.8152509
and if the hair is short, add a long natural hair, and lift it with the one where you leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.	If the hair be short, put with it a long natural hair so that it may be raised together with that; or let the hair grow till it reach a greater length, then raise it.	0.77856296
