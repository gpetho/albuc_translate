The author of this book has completed for you, my children, this book which is a part of the knowledge in medicine with its completeness and reached the goal from its clarity and explanation. I saw fit to complete it for you with this article, which is a part of practical work.
Because practical work is improved in our country and time, it is utterly absent to the point of almost studying its science and interrupting its impact. Only minor outlines remained in the first books that were smoothed by hands, and its reality was error and confusion until its meanings became confused and its benefits diminished.
I saw that I should revive and write this article in the way of explanation, clarification, and conciseness, and present vivid images and all tools of work, for it is an increase in explanation and a need for what one needs.
The reason why there is no expert surgeon with his own hands in our time, because medical surgery takes a long time and the owner should rest beforehand in Galen's description of anatomy. Until he stands on the benefits of organs, their structure, their condition, and connection, and separation, knowing bones, nerves, muscles, their number, their outlets, sinews, and places where their outlets are.
Therefore, it was said that doctors by name are many but in reality few, especially in the art of surgery, and we have mentioned this aspect at the beginning of this book.
Because one who is not knowledgeable about what we mentioned in anatomy would certainly fall into a mistake that kills people, as I have seen many of those who imagined in this knowledge and claimed it without knowledge or expertise.
That which I saw, a doctor ignorant, cut into a pig's fat tumor in the neck of a woman, severed some of her neck arteries and bled her blood to death before his very eyes.
I saw another doctor who advanced in removing a stone from a man who had penetrated his bladder, and the stone was large. He panicked but managed to extract it with a piece of bladder tissue. The man died approximately three days later, and I was summoned to remove it. I saw the size of the stone and the state of the affected person, which exceeded my expectations.
I saw another doctor who was making his living among some of our local military leaders through medicine.
I saw a black boy with a fracture near the ankle and an injury. The doctor, in haste, tightened the break onto the wound using ligatures and splints tightly without leaving any breathing space for the injury.
Then he indulged in his desires, then left him for days and ordered him not to tie the bandage until his leg and foot swelled up and was supervising his death.
So I summoned him, and he quickly released the bandage, allowing relief from his pains. He was no longer in agony, but decomposition had set deeply within the limb, and I couldn't remove it.
Decay continued to spread through the limb until death ensued.
I saw another doctor who treated a malignant tumor, which after days became so large that it grew to the point of infecting his patient. This is because when cancer is mixed with black blood, it should not be exposed purely to iron.
Except for a member that allows for total excision.
And that is why, my children, it's important for you to understand that work with the hand divides into two: work accompanied by safety and work which often encounters difficulty in most cases.
And warnings have been given in every place where such risky and fearful work appears, it's important for you to be cautious and refuse it.
So that the ignorant do not find the path to speak and attack, take for yourselves firmness and caution, and treat your illnesses with kindness and steadfastness.
And use the best way leading to safety and good outcome, and tackle dangerous and difficult illnesses.
And purify yourselves from anything you fear might be suspected about your religion and worldly affairs, for it will be beneficial to you both in this world and the hereafter based on your destiny.
And Galen, in some of his instructions, said: Do not treat a disease that is bad and call yourselves doctors of evil.
And this article has been divided into three sections.
The first door.
In the first section, there is a detailed description of fire and surgical knives for centuries. It includes illustrations of tools, blades for surgery, how to operate the knives, and everything needed in hand surgery work.
The second door.
In the second section, there is an organized presentation on incisions, cuts, suturing, bloodletting, surgeries, and arrow removal among other things, accompanied by illustrations of tools.
The third door.
In leverage and extraction and the treatment of dislocations, and similar procedures, there is a well-organized method from century to century with illustrations of the machines.
The first door.
In the knee.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary to describe its method of use, advantages, disadvantages and in what condition it is used.
And I say that discussing how the knee benefits and its drawbacks is a long, precise science with hidden secrets, about which many wise people have spoken.
And they differed on it, and I shortened their brief speech to avoid lengthening it unnecessarily.
And I say that the knee benefits in general for all bad moods accompanied by matter and without matter, which are two states: the hot mood without matter and the dry mood without matter.
And as for the dry mood with matter, they differed on it. Some said that the knee is beneficial in such a condition while others opposed this view stating that the knee is not suitable in diseases caused by heat and dryness because of the nature of fire being hot and drying.
And it would be impossible to recover from a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry medicine. The one who says against that argues that the knee treated by fire could benefit from a hot and dry illness that occurs in people's bodies. Because if you added the body and its humidity to the fire mood, it would cool down the human body.
And I say as he says, because experience has shown me that much; yet, it is not to be conceived in this matter without one who has become familiar and experienced with the field of the knee. Stands on the difference in moods of people and their health conditions within themselves, causes, symptoms, and duration of time for diseases.
And as for other moods, there is no fear from them for you, especially cold and moist diseases. All the doctors agree on it and they have not disagreed on its benefit by using it.
And know, my children, that the treatment by fire and its advantage over the treatment with burned medicine is because fire is a single essence that does not exceed its action to the organ that affects it, nor harms another connected organ except for minor harm.
And treatment with burned medicine may extend its action beyond the organ and it might cause a disease in the organ that is difficult to cure, or even kill. But fire, due to its dignity and generosity of its essence, does not do this unless it has been excessive.
And we have learned that through experience over the years, with diligence and care in our work, understanding the truths of these matters.
And for this reason, I refrained from lengthy explanations, even though it would be fitting for this book to delve into the secrets of fire and how it operates in bodies as well as its ability to cure diseases through philosophical arguments that provide solid proof for your understanding.
And know, my children, that they have differed about the time when fire treatment is most suitable and they considered spring to be the best season.
And I say that fire treatment can be suitable at all times because the harm caused by time gets absorbed in the benefit brought about by fire treatment. And especially if the fire treatment is for necessary strong pains that cannot bear delay, as what worries us could follow with a disaster greater than the harm already inflicted by time.
Do not let it pass through your minds, my children, what the general public and the foolish physicians think that every disease whose cure has no return should be blamed forever.
Neither is it true that they thought the 'ki' merely functions like a medicine to change mood and dry out wetnesses, which are causes of pains.
Except that the 'ki' prefers over medicine in terms of its speed of success, strength of action, and intensity of its sovereignty.
However, the disease may return at some point in time according to the patient's mood and ability for illness, its strength, what accumulates within his body from excesses there, neglect of himself in acquiring food and such causes.
Allah, let the disease that the 'ki' uses be a mild one and in an organ with little excesses and wetness. Like the 'ki' removes pain, such as it does, it may be that this pain does not return. This would be at least a reduction.
And as for the common saying that the 'ki' is the end of medicine, it's a correct statement rather than believing what they say because they think there's no cure with or without medication after having the 'ki', which contradicts this.
The meaning of "the 'ki' is the end of medicine" simply means that when we used various treatments for a disease and those medications didn't work, then we used the last thing, which is the 'ki', and it did work. From this point, we can conclude that "the 'ki' is indeed the end of medicine. Not in the sense that the general public and many uneducated physicians have come to believe.
I have mentioned at the beginning that gold is better than iron when used for surgical blades. They said this because of the balance and dignity of gold, praising its material quality. They also claimed it doesn't corrode where the blade touches but this is absolutely false.
Because I have tried this, and found that it only does so in some bodies but not others. The one made of gold is better and more effective than iron as they said. Except when you protect the metal by heating it with fire using gold, you may not know exactly when to heat it to the desired degree for the redness of the gold.
And because it quickens the cooling process, and if you increase its heat in fever, it melts in fire. If you try to use it, the manufacturer will be confused by this, so that is why we consider iron knives faster and closer to correctness when used properly Insha Allah (God willing).
This section on the knife was organized by Albucasis into chapters arranged from head to foot, aiming to facilitate what the student wishes for Insha Allah (God willing).
Chapter One.
In the knife for the head, there is one kind.
This type of knife is useful against the dampness and cold that affect the brain, both causes of headaches, frequent head colds spreading from the head to the eyes and ears, frequent sleepiness, toothache, and throat pain. In summary, for every disease that arises from cold such as fever, convulsions, paralysis and the like.
The image of this type of knife instructs the patient to first use a laxative medicine for three or four nights, depending on the strength required by the patient's condition, age, and habits.
Then he commands him to shave his head like Moses and then place him in front of you sitting, having placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the tip of your hand on the tip of his nose between his eyes. If you have reached your middle finger, teach that location using the inkstick.
Then heat the olive oil lamp, which is its image.
Expose the bone as much as the size of the penis or a cherry. Raise your hand and if not, repeat with it or another tool if it cools down. Until you see what I've told you about the bone, then take a bit of salt and dissolve it in water. Wet a cotton ball with it and place it on the spot and leave it for three days.
Then apply to him a cotton ball that has been soaked in oil and leave it on him until the smell of smoke disappears, then treat him with the four ointment until he recovers if God wills.
And they said that the wound becomes better and more beneficial the longer it stays open, allowing for pus to drain out.
And some of them advised to burn the skin up to the bone and keep the iron on until a part of the thickened bone gets burnt, then remove what has been burnt from the bone afterwards and treat.
And others advised to overdo it with the iron until it has a strong effect on the bone, causing some of its parts to fall off like a quirt or a small flake. They claimed that steam from the head comes out from this place and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then he treats until it disappears, and I only see these two types of the operation absolutely in some people. And leaving it with me is better and safer if there are any issues when the natural connection doubles whenever it separates as we have observed in all other members.
And especially when the head of fasting is naturally weak, the first type of ablation becomes permissible and preferable for me. I advise using it, if God willing, then I will work on it.
The Second Chapter.
It is also in my head.
If there is a chronic headache in the head and it has persisted with fasting, use ablation techniques such as cautery, cupping, sweating, ointments, and bandages. Especially if this individual only responds to one type of ablation that we described earlier, but nothing from these treatments helps them, then observe closely. If the head of the fasting person is naturally strong and not weak, and he finds extremely cold temperatures, apply another type of ablation slightly above that. Then, apply ablation to each part of his head until the thickness of the skin goes away and reveals the amount of bone that we described. Then, apply ablation at the back of his head in the area known as the razor blade and be gentle with your hand when doing this. Do not reveal the bone; the fasting person finds this pain extremely intense compared to the pain from all other types of head ablation. I will explain this type of ablation later on its place.
The copper rod with which the corners and back of the head are treated should be softer than the one used for the middle part of the head. This is how it should look.
Chapter Three.
In it is the sisterly condition that is not chronic.
If it happens in the forehead with headache and the pain extends to the eye, then evacuate the pus using medicines that cleanse the head and use all other treatments mentioned in the chapters of diseases. If this does not work, the decision in such cases is between two options. Either by using the acute burning medicine, or by using iron.
If the pus is removed by using a burning medicine, then take one garlic clove, peel it and cut its ends from both sides. Then make an incision at the site of pain with a broad surgical instrument until there is a place under the skin that can accommodate the garlic clove.
Then place it under the skin until it disappears, then tighten it with strings tightly and leave it for about fifteen hours. Then remove it and take out the garlic clove, and let the wound heal for two or three days, then dress it.
Cover the area with a cotton pad soaked in oil until it starts to heal, then treat it with ointment until it heals if Allah wills. If you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medicines I mentioned in chapter eighteenth of the burning medicines.
And if you use iron to remove pus, it is done in this manner: heat up the iron as shown here:.
The tool is called the searing iron because its head resembles a sewing needle, with some curvature and a small knob in the middle.
Then place it on the site of pain, hold your hand and turn the iron a little at a time. The amount that should be burned is about half the thickness of the skin. Raise your hand to avoid burning the lower artery causing bleeding, then dip a cotton in salt water and place it on the spot leaving it for three days. Then hold the cotton in tallow, then treat it with ointment until it heals if God wills.
And if you want, treat this condition with the sharp end of an awl on this part and be cautious to not cut the artery in this temporary condition especially.
The fourth chapter.
This is the permanent condition.
If you treat the condition using the advanced treatment we mentioned, and the treatment didn't work and you find an explanation that none of what we've stated in the first medicine or second fire remedy can do. You should heat the awl until it becomes white, then learn its position by drawing a line lengthwise for half an inch or roughly that. Leave your hand once and pull it as much as to cut the artery reaching near the bone.
'Except that you should be cautious not to touch the moving jawbone when chewing as it may burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it causing spasms.'
And be cautious and vigilant of bleeding from the artery you have cut, for there lies danger in its cutting. And especially for those who were unaware of what to do and were not experienced practitioners, leaving the work undone is preferable.
And there will be detailed instructions for dealing with abnormal bleeding from the artery on its place in this book if God willing. And if you find an explanation that does not fit this method.
I have seen the deceased's body capable of being incised in the middle of the head, as we described and treated the wound until it heals if God willing.
And if you wish, you can use the incision that we mentioned in the section on clamping the artery with a lancet. It is an incision that is better and more effective than this one.
The Fifth Chapter.
In ear-poking surgery.
If pain occurred in the ear due to cold and was treated with softeners and other treatments we mentioned in the division, but the pain did not go away, increase the size of the lancet which is called the point that this illustration represents.
Then, after protecting it around the entire ear like you would rotate or both if the pain is in them. And move the incision slightly away from the base of the ear after learning its location with a needle, making the incision about ten points in each ear or around it. Then treat all positions until it heals if God willing.
The Sixth Chapter.
In surgical strength.
The strength of the force that operates by means of the incision, which is only from the type that produces phlegm as described in sections on diseases.
And one should avoid the type of incision which leads to dryness and spasm of the nerve.
If this type of strength was treated with needles, scissors, and scrapers but the treatment did not work, it should be necessary to strengthen the patient by three incisions. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below its outer rim, and the third at the point where the lips meet.
Make your incision opposite the diseased side, because relaxation only occurs in the side that appears healthy.
A picture of the incision should be made such that it increases in size towards the top ear's tip underneath the forehead slightly, and another one at the mouth. Its length should correspond to the length of the thumb.
You lower your hand with the knife until it burns half through the skin, and this is a picture of the hammer and it's a type of surgical tool that has advanced in its image but it is slightly less harsh than shown. It should have a slight thickness in the knife, then treat the area as described until it heals if God willing.
The Seventh Chapter.
In chronic embolism.
If the embolism was confirmed and treated as we have instructed, but your treatment did not improve or it was not due to illness (i.e., fever), then prescribe four rounds of treatment. On each of his forehead, make an incision in the middle as we have mentioned and an incision at the tip of the nose according to what was previously described.
The recipe for the hammer, as previously described, it may also be applied on a cut in the mouth of the stomach to make it more effective. Then treat according to what was previously described.
The Eighth Chapter.
In the treatment of forgetfulness.
The one that is phlegm-based should be treated by first drinking the large poultices and the purgatives for brain, which cleanse it.
Then he shaves his entire head and places on the back of it a bandage made from cloth that has been written in a description of adhesion. It is removed several times; it is one of the cauterizations.
And do this on the same level as that which I mentioned there; if he is freed by it, otherwise let him have three cauterizations in the back of his head, they should be set up from the top of the head to below the neck.
And place a finger nail between each cauterization and another, then treat the cauterizations with what was mentioned earlier. If you want to increase it and if it is probable that the reason for this, let him have the middle cauterization.
And if you want to increase it, cauterize the two horns then treat him until he is freed. The dressing should be tallow on the pattern that was presented.
The ninth chapter.
In the case of valgus, apply relaxation to the entire body.
It is necessary that cleansing of the head with lice and what we have mentioned then shave the head of the patient, then cauterize one cauterization in the middle of the head, a cauterization on each horn of the head, and a cauterization at the back.
And three on the neck grooves, if due to the need for body relaxation you need more than that and the patient is capable of it, and the illness is strong and entrenched, cauterize four cauterizations on his back grooves. Continue the cauterization until you burn the most of the skin and lift your hand, then treat it as previously described until he heals if God wills, the dressing should be tallow.
The Tenth Chapter.
In this, epilepsy.
Only those who suffer from epilepsy due to phlegm should be treated. It is necessary to cleanse their brain first using large catheters and all the treatments we have mentioned in the division when the obstruction is substantial and it is likely that they can take medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate the medicines, let him use the syringes and brain-cleansing powders before that for many days with improvement in his nutrition.
Then he shaves his head, then applies one kind of oil in the middle of the head as described earlier, and another kind at its end. On each part of his head, apply oil, if the patient is strong and capable, apply the oils that are mentioned in 'Al-Jabali's book, relaxation of the body on cervical vertebrae and thoracic vertebras, and let the massage be oily according to the previous description.
If it is an obstructed child, make the massage gentle as shown in this manner.
The Eleventh Chapter.
In the treatment of smallpox.
If the cause of smallpox is bad moisture and sticky phlegm, apply the oils that were mentioned in 'Al-Jabali's book.
If the cause of smallpox is a preference inclined to black and makes the body of the patient excessively moist, cleanse his brain as described in the section.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cotton wad like a circle and place it in the middle of his head while the patient is sitting upright touching every side. Then take one pound of old sheep tallow.
Then heat it on fire with moderate heat as much as can be tolerated when the finger is inserted into it. Then pour its content in the middle of his head in a ring and leave him until it cools down. Do this to each digit once every week along with all other good treatments until he recovers if Allah wills.
And if you want to weaken it, puncture it with many small points without touching the iron with your hand. Rather, let there be an aroma; this kind of injury moistens the brain moderately.
Then place cotton that has been soaked in oil or chicken fat on it.
The Second Chapter.
In the case of water that has fallen in the eye.
If you notice the signs of water having fallen into the eye as described in the previous section, act quickly with the ill person to clean his head and protect him from all wetness. Give him baths on a mild basis for several days.
Then, shave his head and soak it in the middle of his head. Then, soak two wads on his cheeks if the water fell in both eyes or from one side. If it fell in only one eye, do it on that one.
Then, cut all the veins and arteries beneath the skin with the iron. Let the wads be as long as twice the width of the cheeks and watch out for bleeding.
If you see anything out of the ordinary, cut it off in place with any treatment possible and we will provide wisdom on suturing arteries, cutting them, and avoiding bleeding.
And it may be that two strong wads are placed under the cheekbones.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the case of chronic weeping.
If the tears in the eye are constant and perennial, having been before through the veins and arteries located on the forehead from outside of the head, and it was confirmed that this is due to a cold, sticky mucus overflow. This is what I described as the initial water flowing out when describing the condition. A method located in the middle of the head, two on the cheeks, and two under the elbows below the bones. If an increase is needed, add one more to each side from the tip of the eyebrow by a small dot.
The fourteenth chapter.
In the case of nasal bleeding.
If treatment with what we mentioned in the section did not work, administer quick bleeding from the nosebleed three nights in a row. Then shave his head and apply the middle point on it using an oily stick for application. Then apply with the oily stick two points above the eyebrows under the hair slightly, be careful not to cut the artery, this is a representation of the pungent stick.
The fifteenth chapter.
In the case of relaxing the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to illness or moisture, apply one point on the eyelid with this semicircular stick.
And if you wish, apply above the eyebrows slightly two points in each side, and keep a distance from the cheeks, and make each point as long as the eyebrow.
Do not overdo your hand with the point, but according to what burns a third of the skin, and make the stick shape as shown here.
The Sixteenth Section.
In the corner of the eye.
If its lashes turn inward and touch the eye, the corner in question has two types. Either by fire or by burned medicine, if it is by fire then you should order the patient to stop plucking his eyelashes until they grow long and even.
If the corner of his eye has thickened, you should bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until it grows and becomes even. Once it has grown and become even, place the patient's head on your stone then draw on the eyelash with a stick in the shape of a leaf-shaped mark.
The marking starts close to the eyelashes then you place cotton dipped in the white of an egg or saliva on the lower lid. Then, heat up a needle for this process.
Then, apply the shape you've taught yourself slightly and repeatedly many times until the skin surface that resembles a leaf of asa appears completely burned. A sign of the healthiness of your work is when you see the eyelash has been charred and the hair has risen above the eye lid.
Lift your hand in that case and leave him for three days, then take some cotton dipped in honey to remove the eyelash stubs. Then treat him with ointment until he recovers if God wills. If any hair grows back after a while and relaxes his eyelid, it means the process is complete.
Repeat the procedure in that place as you did initially, if the hair is on the lower lid then remove it until it returns to its natural position and does not cause the eyelashes to turn inward. As for plucking with burned medicine, you should order the patient to stop plucking his eyebrows until they grow long and even.
Then make a parchment paper from the oiled paper. Then take accustomed soap and unextinguished gunpowder, from each weigh one dirham or about that, then crush them all well with a good crushing, and do this using the wheel so they don't dry out. Then spread it on the oiled paper which you made as an ace paper, and place it over one or both eyelids. Put cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and place the top of the garlic bulb in your砚 stone.
Then place your middle finger on the medicine and gently press it. When you feel the garlic reacting to the medicine, as it finds pleasure like fire in it, keep pressing until it stops finding any pleasure. Then move your finger to dislodge the medicine from there and wash the eye with water when the sensation disappears.
Then observe; if you see that the eyelid has lifted up, as it does when burned with fire or cuttings, otherwise apply more medicine on the area where the medicine didn't affect. Continue this process until the eye is charred according to your work. Then place cotton greased with fat over it until a piece of burning comes off.
Then treat it with the quince ointment or otherwise until it heals. When performing the work, you should take utmost care that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye; if the eyelid relaxes after days and we fear a bit of hair in the eye.
Then, apply the medicine on the part of the eyelid that relaxed specially as you did at first. Continue treating it until it heals. This is a method for the ointment paper ace (or possibly 'parchment ace' or similar).
Know that people's eyes may vary in size, so adjust your approach accordingly. There isn't any secret to the right path for someone who follows this kind of trade or practice.
The Seventeenth Chapter.
In the operation of placing an instrument in the eye socket.
If you treat the operation of inserting a surgical instrument in the eye socket according to what we have discussed in sections on diseases, but if your treatment does not succeed, it is necessary that you rely on this feature.
The orders of the patient are that he should place his head on your pillow and hold his head captive between your hands in such a way that it doesn't move or jolt.
Then, you place a cotton wick soaked in the white of the egg or saliva of the gecko on his eyes. Then, you heat the iron as it is shown here.
It should be bent like the feather of an eagle from one end which holds the needle, and if you wish, it can have a pointed tip on the other end. Alternatively, it could be flattened like a hammer but know that this bent iron is better for your operation if God wills.
Then, squeeze the nacor if it is open and remove its membrane. Wipe or if it is not open you will open it to extract its pus. Then, place the iron on him; she is very strong, hold her with your hand until you reach the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the needle towards the nose to avoid misplacing it or causing anxiety to the patient that might result in damaging his eyelid. If, upon entering the first needle, you reach the bone, otherwise reapply the iron if necessary.
Leave him for three days, then cover him with cotton smeared with butter and treat him with the dried ointment until he heals. If it has been forty days and he has not healed, apply a strong medicine until the bone is exposed, as will be explained in its respective chapter if God wills.
Another way to deal with the tip of the nail, some surgeons mentioned, is to cut into the nail bed and then place a thin plug in the same gap. This is how it's done.
You pour a weight equivalent to one dirham of melted lead into it, hold the plug firmly with your hand in an advantageous position, ensuring that there is no movement at all from the object, lest the molten lead seep into its hole. It would be advisable to place cotton dipped in egg white or water over the opening of the object.
If the lead burns the location of the nail bed and cleans it in a very unusual way, if the nail bed is cleaned by using what we have mentioned about incision and treatment. Otherwise, there will inevitably be the use of the nasal piercing and return of the nail to its original passage as explained in detail later on.
The eighteenth chapter.
In the incision of the upper lip.
Incisions in the lip are very common, known as hairs, especially in young boys. They often occur and if treated with what we've discussed earlier, the treatment fails to work. Then you should heat a small surgical scalpel on this image.
Its interior is heated on the blade of a knife. Then, hold it in the same incision until the incision reaches the depth of the incision and then heal it with the hot paste until God willing, it gets cured.
The nineteenth chapter.
In the incision of the piercing that occurs in the mouth.
If it appears in the root of the gum or in the palate or at the roots of teeth causing a piercing, which becomes red and bursts, turning into a flowing pus-filled piercing. If treating this did not result in recovery, it would be necessary to heat a small iron on its measure fitting the piercing.
Then the nurse enters into the rhino's hole and holds your hand until the nail reaches the depth of its front and back part, she does this once or twice then heals it according to the treatment mentioned for healing until it recovers if Allah wills.
If the material is cut off and it recovers, otherwise an exposure on the place is necessary and the affected bone is removed according to what will be discussed in its section if Allah wills.
Chapter Nineteen.
In it, the pulling and relaxation of the reins and braces.
If the ligament relaxes due to moisture and the reins move, treat it with medicines but if it doesn't get better, put the head of the patient on your knee then prepare the hot iron that appears after this instruction. After placing the tube on the rein.
The hot iron is inserted by the nurse with the wheel, holding your hand for a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the end of the rein. Then you raise your hand and repeat putting the iron on it as many times as desired. The patient then fills its mouth with salt water.
He holds it for an hour and then throws him away. The moving rein gets fixed, the relaxed ligament tightens, and the excessive moisture dries up.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In dealing with pain in the rein (or perhaps the elbow).
If the pain in the rein is due to cold or there's a worm inside and no treatment with medicines helps, it has two methods of treatment: either by applying lard, or by applying fire.
If it involves butter, then take the cow's butter and boil it in an iron flask or a sieve. Then take cotton and twist it on the tip of the needle. Dip it into the boiled butter and place it on the painful tooth with the wheel, holding it until it cools down.
Then do it several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. If you wish, you can dip wool or cotton into cold butter and place it on the painful tooth, and put a protected spike above it so that the fire reaches to the bottom of the tooth.
And if it involves fire, then you should use a copper or iron pipe and have some wax inside it so that the heat of the fire does not reach the root of the tooth. Then heat up the tool that will be used and place it on the same tooth, hold your hand until the tool cools down. You do this several times.
If the pain goes away either that day or another, it is necessary afterward to have the patient fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then throw it out. This is what the tool looks like.
It is hammered on any side you wish and according to what is possible, this is how the pipe looks.
The Second Twenty Chapter.
In the case of pigs' tallow.
If the pigs' tallow is with mucus and cold fluids that do not yield to maturation through medicines, and you want quick maturation, then heat up the hollow tool as it has this shape with its two ends being pointed.
Smoke should come out from the other end when tallowing. Place it protected on the same tumor once or twice if needed, until you reach the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the tool according to the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and carry on him a cotton pad soaked in oil until what burns by fire goes away. Then treat him with the ointment and threads until he recovers if Allah wills.
The twenty-third chapter.
In the middle of the cavity of the windpipe and constriction of the breath.
If moisture predominates in the bronchial passage, especially when accompanied by depression of mood, it is necessary to first evacuate the pus using medicines that facilitate evacuation. Then, apply friction therapy at the base of the neck near the larynx in the depressed area.
Be careful not to extend the treatment to the larynx, and do not burn the skin except halfway. Then apply another kind of friction at the joint of the neck at the end of its strongest part, where the implement is needle-like on the surface that was previously mentioned.
Then treat him/her with what has been described until he/she recovers, if God willing.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In the case of lung disease and coughing.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture, and there is no fever or consumption, and the illness is chronic, apply two friction treatments above the hillocks in the soft low areas, and another treatment in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The implement should be needle-like in the shape described, and if you wish, make it a dot treatment with the needle known as the dot, which has been illustrated in its application for puncturing ear pain. The dots should be from thirty to about that number.
Then treat it with what has been mentioned to proceed until it recovers. You can make a three-pronged pincers in this shape and use them quickly as you clip once, three knives at the same time. This is how the pincers look.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In the operation of appendicitis.
If the shoulder blade's head comes loose due to slippery moisture or is not properly placed when it is pushed back until this becomes a habit that repeats, then it will come off with even the slightest movement as we have observed. It should be that the jaw responds first. Then the patient lies on his back or on the correct side. Then, with your left hand, you lift the skin that is inside the appendix up above until the joint has come out inwards.
Then heat the two-pronged pincers, as shown here.
Then you clip the skin until it goes to the other side, resulting in a four-knife shape. You may use a two-pronged pincers for this, turning it into a five-knife shape with the prongs on an angle of the cut surface.
And here is the image of the three-pronged pincer.
And this number may be increased by one, making the knives eight. Then they are applied to the rounded, salted elbows of the skin. The patient is then bound with a bandage and the limb is not moved until it heals. This operation would only be necessary if the dislocation was upwards; otherwise, it seldom occurs.
Apply one or many finely-threaded needles above the knee, or many pointed knives. This will strengthen the joint and eliminate moisture, causing healing of the patient.
Chapter Twenty-Sixth.
In the contents of the stomach.
If there is a lot of cold and moisture in the stomach to remove it from its mood until frequent discharges occurred, and he was treated with various treatments but did not heal. It would be necessary that the patient lie on his back, extend his legs and arms, then compress three cups. A cup under the breast with a capacity of an inch using a pricking needle, and two cups below the side of the single cup until the shape of the cups becomes triangular. There should be space between them so that they do not meet when filled, and the depth of the cup should be one third of the thickness of the skin. The shape of the cups should also be considered.
On this image and at this size without excess.
And if you wish, compress one large cup in the middle of the stomach on this image.
And the needle with which this single cup is compressed should be in the shape of a circle as shown in this image.
And the stomach can be punctured in points for those who are annoyed by this cup, which is that you should teach on the stomach a point according to what you want with the pen, then compress it with a pointed needle, and then treat it with the treatment proposed until he heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seventh.
In the cold liver cyst.
If it was displayed from the liver and pain due to coldness, moisture or from a sour breeze until it had an excessive discharge out of its natural mood, then treated the patient as we mentioned in this section but that did not work. In order for the patient to lie on his chest and learn with ink, three stitches of this shape and quantity should be made under exactly this amount in the liver, where it ends at the junction point of human anatomy.
And after every stitch and stitch with the thickness of a finger, each stitch should be straight along the body without your hand coming into contact with the needle at all. Yes indeed.
Let the size of what burns through the thickness of the skin be half of it, no more. The patient should stand on his feet; if he cannot stand, then lie down with his legs spread and raise his arms. This is how the needle appears.
And you may use the fine needle to make these stitches if you are gentle and skilled in your craft, taking care not to pierce too deeply as this can burn all the skin away, even reaching the intestines. The skin there is thin, so be aware of this.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In the case of a tumor in the liver, using stitches.
If there is an exhalation in the liver and you want to determine whether that tumor is within the liver or its diaphragm, then if it's within the liver, the patient will feel a heaviness and ache without intensity.
And if it's within the liver's diaphragm, there will be intense pain and you'll notice that doctors have abandoned treating it. In this case, the patient should lie on his chest then learn with ink about its heated position.
Then heat the needle in fire, this is the needle that resembles a screw and here it's its appearance. Heating it in one way until the entire skin burns and ends up at the anus so that the full duration comes out, then treat it with abscess treatments until it heals.
This type of operation should only be performed by one who has advanced in the field of medicine and these illnesses have been treated on their hands repeatedly, thus they can undertake such work. Leaving it to me would be better.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
In the operation of tooth extraction.
I mentioned the first operation for preparing hot rods for cold tooth extraction. It is that you should take from the dry, long origin of the hot rod one piece that is as long as you can find it and should be like a thick finger. Then dip it in oil and bring it to fire. Then heat one rod between the connection of the collarbone and neck, and two smaller rods slightly tilted towards the chin. Two large ones are placed above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
Two rods are also placed between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly to the back. Another rod is in the middle of the chest, one above the stomach, and three behind another one, between the shoulders. Two more are on both sides of the spine below the rib bone that's in between the shoulder blades.
It should not be that you delve your hand deep into the rod, but it should just penetrate the surface of the skin. Some of them have mentioned that some people used a half-inch iron nail and protect it with a heat-resistant material; they would insert it between the vertebrae until it reaches to the tumor itself.
The duration of the rod, as we mentioned in the liver tumor, this operation with the rod through the intestines either causes death from its heat or it may lead to a condition that cannot heal.
Chapter Thirty.
In the appendix.
If you have treated liver disease with the remedies we mentioned in this section, and if your treatment was not effective, then it is necessary for you to consider three aspects: all of them are correct. One could be to puncture it with three or four needles arranged along the length of the liver.
In the form of liver needles that present their shape, and there is a thickness between each needle similar to or slightly more than an adult's finger. The technique used in puncturing the liver should follow what we mentioned earlier for puncturing the liver; you do not need to deeply insert your hand through the needle. Imagine the patient lying on their back like Al U'lib.
The second aspect is in the accompanying figure, and you lift the skin that covers the liver where the accompanying furrow ends for Al U'lib's accompanying furrow. You also lift the skin above the liver where the left accompanying furrow ends. Lifting your skin across the body width causes the needles to be arranged along the body length.
Then, you insert the two needles carefully so that they puncture the skin from the other side. Afterward, you remove the instrument; this results in four needles. If desired, you can use another tool with three needles for the puncturing process.
Then, treat the area after allowing it to drain pus for a long time; this is more effective than other treatments you have mentioned.
Chapter Forty-One.
In the act of pouring out or emptying.
The needle is only useful for pouring out the liquid, especially in cases of vomiting. If your treatment does not work after trying various treatments as mentioned in this section, it's necessary to puncture four needles around the abdomen and one needle on the stomach.
Another incision on the liver and one on the gallbladder, two incisions behind his back between the ribs, one closer to his chest and another closer to his stomach. The depth of the incision should be nearly as thick as the skin. Then the incision is left open allowing pus to drain for a long time.
Do not abandon treatment for the invalid after making the incision as much should be done until recovery is hastened, and the image of the needle with which one sews the back appears pitted like a pinecone according to its advancement in size and the needle with which one sews the back becomes oily.
The Second and Thirtieth Chapter.
In the incisions of the feet and legs.
If they swell in the ankle and fill with yellow water, it should be sewn on the back of the foot at the incision between the instep and the arch.
Hold your needle with your hand and do not twist it, then lift your hand and don't place it back immediately because the yellow water will drain away. Your needle should be used in this manner.
Then, make two incisions on each leg, with two incisions in every single leg. The incision should be made at the needle end of the needle and it should go along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another closer to the middle of the leg and towards the thigh. For each thigh, make two incisions as well.
Leave the incision open without treatment for a long time, allowing water to drain from it. Then treat it with all the things we have mentioned.
The Thirty-Third Chapter.
In the case of diarrhea.
If diarrhea is due to cold and moisture affecting the weak digestive powers in the stomach and small intestine, various treatments are applied. However, if it persists and I see that the patient could benefit from increased strength, I administer a large dose of medicine on his stomach. Based on what has been explained about the stomach, it is massaged with a circular motion and four kneading techniques around the navel. It's done gently with the soft pinching technique. A large pinch or two cotton balls are placed above the tongue.
If I observe that moisture is abundant and the patient seems susceptible to this, I apply a pinch on the elbow joint and on each rib. Perhaps I might add two smaller pinches near the larger one. This treatment is successful; its benefits are not mistaken, may God have mercy.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the pinching of the sitz bath.
If there are recurrent or single instances of persistent bowel movements in the sitz bath, and these involve a mixture of thick, cold, or stagnant water causing problems, they have been treated as described in our previous sections but if no improvement is observed, I apply three pinches on the lower part of the back under the table slightly triangularly.
A pinch under the navel with the size of two fingers. If I judged that his stomach might be cold, and that his food does not digest well, seeing that he has a bloated face, I administer medicine to the stomach with a large pinch as previously mentioned, and also on his liver. Another is on the gallbladder with a pinching technique, and I leave the pinch open for some time. Then, I treat him until he recovers if Allah wills.
Chapter Thirty-Four
In the matter of sweat spots.
After cutting it, if the artery is cut, heat the iron that resembles a plow then insert it into the same cut artery and hold your hand until the iron reaches the bleeding wound from which blood is flowing. Do this once or twice.
If the sweat spots are numerous, treat each one like what we have described then heal it with substances that suit her until she recovers. If its intensity is also large on cotton, it will be more beneficial in effectiveness.
Chapter Thirty-Five
In the matter of the oil lamp that is in the chair and its surroundings.
If the suppuration does not reach the cut and the operation we described in its place is refused, it may recover with the oil. If one of the lamps has a spill and wet harmful substances flow from it, the first thing you should measure against it is a delicate reed.
Then measure the depth of the spill with a reed, heat the iron that resembles a plow then insert it into the oil lamp in a straight line equal to the depth of the spill and the size of the area where the reed was inserted. Heat it with oil until it burns all the harmful substances completely. Do this once or twice or three times according to your needs.
And beware of burning nerves if they exist or there is a large artery, and if the oil lamp leads to the bladder organ or to the stomach organ.
Be cautious of all these places, and do this only if the oil lamp is in a place affected by inflammation and you've determined that it's not penetrating. Then treat the area until it recovers completely. If the location closes off and cuts off its material supply and stays like that for some time, know that it has recovered perfectly.
If the materials do not cease, know that it is poisonous or in a diseased bone cavity or something similar which will be mentioned in its appropriate place.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the kidney.
If pain occurs in the kidney due to cold or a thick wind, and there is a decrease in the ejaculatory volume, it should be treated by heating the area with a hot surgical instrument like the amulet. It might require three treatments at the same table, resulting in three arranged treatments which would result in greater benefit.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
In the bladder.
If weakness and laxity occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, causing inability to retain urine, apply treatments in the lower part of the pubis over the bladder where the pain hair begins. One treatment below the belly button and another on the right side of the pubis and another on the northern side.
And after the treatment from each side up to the width of the thumb, apply a hot treatment at the lower back or two if needed. The instrument should be like an amulet as previously mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In the womb.
If cold and moisture affect material in the womb, it may stop menstrual flow causing it to become unhealthy or impure. In case she experiences pain during menstruation, it should be treated with three treatments around the pubis as we have mentioned for the bladder. A treatment on the cotton below the back or two treatments. The instrument should be like an amulet.
The forty-first chapter.
In this section, you remove the thigh bone.
You might install false dampness towards the true hip, which becomes a reason for its displacement from its place. Its symptom is that the leg lengthens over the other when measured against each other, and you find a gap in the position of removal. It would be desirable to support the deficiency at the true hip itself, like half a circle.
After learning with the quill around the truth, as it turns out, the same truth should be placed in the center of the circle and make the wedge appear as a shape inside half the stomach. If this wedge does not come to you, use three wedges made from the large oily wedge.
Make the wedge deep enough according to the thickness of all the skin, then heal it until Allah willing, he is cleansed.
The forty-first chapter.
In the wedge of female perspiration.
If there is pain in the hip and this was caused by a cold and dampness, treat the deficiency with what we mentioned earlier. If the treatment doesn't alleviate the pain and it continues, it would be advisable to relieve the mixture of thick materials from the deficiency using something that promotes secretion or from a species like soap, among other things.
Then make the wedge and position it on two rows, either with burned medicines or with fire. The wedge made from fire has many forms; one of which is to support the true hip itself with three triangular wedges like this figure.
Make it deep enough for her. Ensure there is a suitable distance between each wedge, depending on the thickness of the fingers, and make the wedge oily. You may support one wedge in the middle above the hip bone itself to be four wedges if you wish. Otherwise, use the circle mentioned earlier for removing the hip as a single wedge.
For the circle to encompass all the thigh and burn through the entire skin, this is the characteristic of a boil in sweat on women where the pain is necessarily confined to the thigh itself and does not extend to the calf.
If it extends to the thigh and calf, consider two boils on the thigh at the place indicated by the symptoms of pain. A boil above the navel with four fingers towards the back side a little bit is to be cut, and the needle should penetrate deep enough only according to the thickness of the skin.
And if the pain extends towards the fingers of the foot, consider a boil where you are directed by the needle for three or four times or more if needed. And if the pain indicates down to the knee towards the calf, consider there one boil that is needle-like.
And make sure when cutting the boil not to cut it so much that you sever a major nerve or artery, for this would result in a serious or temporary harm according to the patient.
I have seen two cases where the boil was cut above the navel and then spread in cutting, causing the leg to swell until it reached up to the ankle and affected everything down there. It resulted in diarrhea and death afterwards. If the pain is present on both sides, they should be treated with this characteristic method.
And some wise scholars have mentioned the characteristics of boils on the thigh. They state that such a boil is made like half a cup from iron, with its diameter being about one-third of a yard. It has a hardness resembling the core of a date or slightly less within it. Inside this cup, there are another and then a third cup.
And it is located roughly between the two cups, at a distance similar to the width of an elbow. The cups are open on both sides and their height reaches about one or two handbreadths. It has platforms made of iron that fit inside the cups; this is its appearance.
Then it is burned in the fire until it turns red and is thrown out, then placed on the right hip and the ileum lying on the correct side so that three cylindrical supports are applied in one instance. Then it is left for three days, treated with animal fat, and allowed to keep the wound open for some days.
Many then treat it with the ointment until it heals, said the author of this book, this kind of cloth we rarely used for its unpleasant smell and appearance and because few people could bear it. However, it is suitable for those who are tolerant to it and have had similar experiences.
And as for the cloth made with burned medicines, it is to create two small, somewhat circular cloths that allow condensation to drip from the hinges of the door, either from brass or iron.
Their height will be about two decades or close to it, and the distance between them would be as thick as an adult's finger. They should have an opening at the bottom and top that is open. Some of them stick together in this manner.
Then it is placed on the right hip and ileum while lying on the correct side, patting your hand smoothly. Then water is poured between two circles which is slightly heated with fire. It stays in this position for a small hour, and the ileum stands its taste and burns of it, finding delight as if it were from fire.
Until the pain subsides, then lift your hand using a tool and wipe off the hot water from the entire hip with fresh water. Then leave it for three days and bear the animal fat until all signs of burning disappear, leaving it some more time as it allows phlegm to flow out. It is most beneficial in terms of effectiveness.
Then treat him with bandages until he heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, I make a mold for it where water can be held according to what was made on the buttocks, both are similar, this is the description of acute water and it has been proven in my article about rectifying medicines.
You take from the salt of the brine and from unquenched terebinth acid, one part of each. Crush them and place them in a new pot that has been pierced at its bottom with a small hole, sized to allow the reflux to enter. Underneath the bottom of the pot, place another pot filled with seasoned concoction.
And pour on the brine and terebinth acid as much water that can submerge them with one finger, after you hold them together in your hand tightly. Leave the pot until the acid water falls to the bottom of the seasoned pot. Then collect all of this liquid and pour it onto another batch of fresh terebinth acid and brine.
In this case, the severity of the pain becomes very strong and it behaves in many medical procedures and affects various body parts as it performs fire's actions exactly. Some medicines like thafasia (a type of mint), honey from balsam trees, terebinth acid with soap are among those that can strengthen bones too.
Galen, a famous doctor, told a story about an ancient man who treated pain in the hip and sweating in women. He said that he had improved this so much that he claimed it doesn't need any other treatment and that one application cures completely.
Even to the extent that he might have had someone carry him into a bath and come out cured, just by taking something from the green sedge. If there is no green sedge available, he would take the dry version instead, adding a bit of oil to it and applying it where the pain is or on the leg or thigh.
It tightens and relaxes for up to three hours or until the patient feels relief from the burning sensation. Then, they should be placed in a hot bath when their body has cooled down before being moved into a larger tub. The pain will subside and heal with the permission of God; if it does not heal, they should be subjected to the treatment again after ten days.
If God wills, it may heal. And know that no one should use these drugs with the wine until they have exhausted their body. As Herophilus mentioned, if a ewe gets drunk with its milk, sweating from women's sweat can benefit from it.
The method for using this remedy involves taking wool and soaking it in old olive oil, then placing it on the deep spot located between the thumb and the index finger of the hand, closer to the ring finger. Then take a dry ewe's milk (or the milk of a lactating animal).
Heat it with fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then take another one; keep repeating this process until the sensation reaches through the back to the thigh, and the pain will subside with God's permission. This method of using alcohol is called 'wine remedy'.
The second and fortieth chapter.
In the case of back pain.
Back pain may occur due to various reasons such as falling or hitting, excessive exhaustion, and so on. It can result from the accumulation of cold moisture material. The 'wine remedy' is applicable only in this category.
It is due to the accumulation of cold material. After exhausting the patient, it would be good for them to use a drink like mulberry juice or something similar, and they should have three rows of back pain where his pain is located on the width of the table itself, after learning its location with wool in each row. You may apply more than five 'wine remedies' per row depending on what you estimate suitable based on your understanding of their capacity and strength.
And the blow is at the point of the needle, and if you wish to increase it, three or four blows by the size of cylindrical beads on this image.
The eighty-fourth chapter.
In the blow where the opening begins.
This ailment is often seen in young children, and the initial sign of its occurrence in a child is difficulty breathing when they stand up or move. You will find at the end of their back some nodules that have risen to protrude among all the others.
If you see this and wish to stop it, puncture with an incision that is circular as depicted in the image. Take the blow evenly on each side of the lump, and if you wish, perform it around the lump with a point incision in two or three rows; let the points be close to each other. Then treat the area until it heals as described.
And remember, you should only use the blow in the lump that results from nerve spasms.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the blow for gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are due to cold dampness spreading through any part of the body, if they occur in both legs, doctors usually call this particular type of gout.
If cold gout has been treated with various forms of treatment as mentioned in the section, and if the joint pains do not disappear, then the blow will remove them. It involves puncturing around both legs joints with many incisions and making a point incision that is medium-sized as depicted here.
And if you need to puncture a man's face, do so with the point-making tool, if pain rises to the knees or to all joints and it frequently happens that he is treated by placing four or three oil-applying points on each knee using this same oil point.
And if you need more than this amount, apply it and do not insert your hand deeply with the application; only allow for the thickness of the skin. If pain rises to the thighs or back, use what we have mentioned about the application in its respective section.
And if the pains are only in the arms, puncture around the wrists like two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, puncture each joint with a point and use the hand comb. If the pains rise after days to the shoulders or elbows.
Apply them from each side, no doubt exists in proper treatment and taking medicines; if he has good diet and expels phlegm, with this application he will be cured if God willing.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the application for scabies.
If a boil appears in the scrotum and some pus and mucus descend into his testicles, being an early and beginning stage, it would be advisable to order the patient to refrain from eating that day and to use some of the emetics that induce bowel movements from inside.
Then have him lie down on his back between your hands, instruct him to hold himself until the mucus or pus comes out. Then push it back with your finger, and then apply the applicator under the boil on the ischial bone in a mark resembling half of a circle at its ends reaching towards the top of the body.
Then it heats up to resemble its picture.
Until she comes white, throwing out the evil spirits. Then she returns the intestines or gallbladder to its place and then a servant places his hand on that spot so it doesn't bulge. And she stood between the feet of the patient who were wrapped in a mat and a second servant held her legs together.
And one behind him on his chest holds his hands, then the mawahib is placed on the same sign and your hand with the mawahib upright straight, holding it until it reaches the bone or repeats the action once if it did not reach the bone in the first attempt.
And conserve your effort so as not to cause the protrusion of the intestines while you are fasting, in order to prevent burning them; which may lead either to death or a very painful situation for the patient. Remember that if you did not reach with your fasting to the bone, your work was unsuccessful. And it should be known that for boys, their mawahib (a type of instrument) must be soft on their body parts and for adults, it should suit them accordingly.
Then, after three days, treat the area of the fasting with fat until it disappears. Then treat it with other medicines until he is healed and may lie on his back for forty days until the wound heals completely.
And it should be necessary for you to make his diet during the treatment period what eases his stomach so that he does not protrude the intestines when urinating and defecating. Then, if he wants to stand after forty days, use a strong belt and keep it for another forty days. It will help reduce fatigue, overeating of food and drinks, and extreme crying.
If he uses this precaution, may God grant him a complete cure, and I will mention the treatment for white threadworm in its chapter if Allah willing. As for the hernia that occurs elsewhere in the abdomen and starts as small, if you want to prevent it from increasing further than its original size, it should be treated with a round diet tailored to its capacity. Let the amount of skin to be burned be one-third, then treat it with what we have mentioned. If Allah willing, it will not increase. Some predecessors also stated that a loop like this should be used to tighten a hernia.
After learning to treat hernias with a needle, make the lines of the stitch on the upper side of the hernia and the other down below. Lower your hand in the middle with one pronged stitch. The first stitch is easier and better if Allah wills.
The sixty-fourth chapter.
In the stitch of the wedge.
If there occurs in some organs about dropping or beating causing pain that lasts for a long time and the medical treatment did not alleviate it, then it should be tightened with a point loop. Each organ should have a stitch according to its size, strength, and weakness.
And relieve the pain and the wedge from it, if it is relieved from the first stitch. Otherwise, reapply the stitch because it's common for these pains to spread to what is near them; therefore, you should follow up with another stitch until the afflicted person is relieved.
The seventy-fourth chapter.
In the stitch for leprosy.
However, those who have been burned can benefit greatly from the stitch. Especially for lepers, who were previously phlegm-filled and black due to contamination.
If you want to make a stitch, look at the leprosy. If it is in its beginning and treated with what we mentioned earlier without any signs of improvement or stopping and fearing that corruption might take over all his skin, then sew on the head five stitches. One in the middle of the usual forehead, the second below it towards the front at the end of the hair and two on the eyebrows, one behind on the temples. Let your fingers stay a little with the knife until it has a slight effect on the bone.
And the scales are removed to facilitate the release of heavy vapors from it and also to flatten these parts like the liver as mentioned in the head. And if syphilis has persisted on the semen and manifested visibly, then it should be flattened by this type of treatment that we have discussed for the head. A lump on the tip of the nose, two lumps on each cheekbone, two lumps on the adam's apple and six on the thoracic vertebrae. There is a large lump at the pubis when it becomes weak, another one above it in the same plane, and two on each buttock for each buttock. Two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the calves, two on the biceps, two on the ribs, and flattening on each joint of his hands and feet like a lump. Also, two at the back of each heel and tethers both his hands.
Be cautious of the nerves at the heel to avoid burning them, and it may be flattened like a lump on the fibula bone, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver. Remember that each time you increase the lump, it becomes more effective and beneficial.
And be aware that semen does not feel pain from the lump as true ones do, because his body is numb. It should be noted that the adjustment of hot and cold must be according to the organs and joints as previously mentioned regarding the properties of metals.
Then treat the eye with corn powder mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals, if Allah willing.
The forty-fourth chapter of the eighth.
In operating with anesthesia, when an organ has been anesthetized and treated with medicines, ointments, and dressings but still does not heal, the person responsible for the operation should continue to administer the same type of anesthesia according to the size or importance of the organ. For instance, use a larger dose if the organ is large and slightly thinner than usual if it's covered by thick skin.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals. Some anesthetic may remain, especially in areas of the back where the hand and foot are exposed to nerve endings that control that organ; this can cause some lingering anesthesia.
And do not attempt this unless you are knowledgeable about the anatomy of organs and the exit points of body nerves that move them.
The ninety-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of scabies.
If scabies persists and no medical remedies have worked, apply a small depth of oil on the affected area according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil powder mixed with the paste of rose leaves, mucus of the pregnant camel, chicken blood or blood of pigeons. Mix all and apply on a bandage, stick to the area until it heals.
The fiftieth chapter.
In treating cancer.
If the cancer is at an early stage and you wish to halt its progression, apply a large dose of the circular medicine around it as you would rotate it. Some scholars have mentioned applying a very strong remedy in the center, but I do not advocate for that since I expect it might irritate and I've witnessed this happening before.
The correct method is to surround it with a circle as we have said, or with many knots.
Chapter Fifty-One.
In the case of the small intestine obstruction.
If it happens to one of the intestines and its maturation has been delayed, either due to its active virtue or because the nourished individual is old with little blood, or due to time, and if you want to hasten the maturation of the intestine, bind around it many small knots for tightening.
Then leave it, and it will speed up in maturation. If you want to tighten it by tying, make the knot this is its image.
And place it in the middle of the intestine until the skin penetrates, and let the knot be below what is attached for ease in the flow of bile. Then treat it with whatever should be done until it recovers.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
In the case of binding for eating (context might be related to surgical procedures).
The eater is nothing but corruption that seeks into the organ to eat it, like fire eats withered wood. If I see the eater in a position that allows for being bound by fire, then bind it with many mixed pins of different sizes according to what suits this position where the eater exists.
Then bind it from every side so that all corruption is removed and nothing remains, then leave him for three days. Bear sulfur dust mixed with oil on the bound areas to remove all hair and the entire corruption completely.
Then treat it with the herbs that promote healing of the wound. If after three days you see healthy growth of tissue without corruption, otherwise rebind on what remains of the corrupted areas. The eater can be treated with a concentrated medicine.
If it replaces fire, it is more effective. I have mentioned the treatment with the sharp medicine in the division; take it from there whenever you need it.
The fifty-first chapter.
In the section about reversed and non-reversed needles.
Often, this reason occurs in the soles of the feet; it is a rough thing that presses on the foot, and the kiy (a type of tool used in surgery) in this area is on two sides either by fire or by sharp water.
As for the kiy with fire, it is when you heat the dried and brush-like iron moka that resembles a falcon's feather made of iron around each side as wide as the size of the nail. The edge should be thin then lower the heated moka onto the nail, after which move your hand in circles around the nail until the moka reaches to the depth of the nail.
After that, leave it for three days until pus forms on the moka. Then, remove and clean the pus using a thick bread dipped in salt water. Leave this paste on overnight; then it will peel off from its roots. After that, treat the wound with the medicinal ointment for fever, until healing occurs. If the needles are not reversed.
This often occurs on the body surface, especially in hands and legs. It is advisable to take a copper pipe or an iron pipe or a brush feather of a falcon, then lower it onto the nail or splinter. Then, pour a little sharp water into the pipe.
Hold your hand and move it while slightly shaking your hand for the edge of the pipe to impact the root of the nail. The sharp water will then find its way down into the root of the nail, causing the sufferer to endure a moment on the taste of the sharp water.
Then leave it, for the needle will pull out by itself from its roots. Do this one at a time until all that is there in the body becomes available to you, then treat the places after the healing of what grows from the wounds that promote flesh formation.
The fortieth and fifth chapter.
In the case of piercing.
If a piercing occurs in one of the nodes of the nerve or from a quarter fever or otherwise, it is necessary to create four or five knots on the spine between each node knot and in his chest a knot. And on his stomach, a knot with the oil hammer, then the piercing settles and speeds up the maturation of the cold disease.
The fiftieth chapter.
In the case of the sudden bladder disorder in the body.
If there should emerge in the body dirty bladders caused by bad hard cold matter, it may be that when they first appear they should be tied on the head of each mild-bladder with a string made moist by fire or by the long end of a razor, or by an oil hammer.
The pimples may be tied with this method in the first eruption, so they do not increase and disappear the active merit of them and cleanse him from it except that it should be after emptying himself by urination.
The sixty-fifth chapter.
In the case of bleeding that occurs during artery ligation.
Blood leakage often occurs from an artery that has been cut during a wound exposed from the outside or when opening a tumor or body part and so on, it is difficult to cut it.
If this happens to one, quickly put your index finger on the artery's mouth and hold it gently until all blood is contained under your finger and nothing escapes from it. Then place several small and large tallow wicks in fire until they become very smoky.
Then, take one either small or large depending on the wound and the location where the artery burst. Put the tallow stick over the same vein after swiftly removing your finger with a wheel; hold the stick until the blood stops.
If, when lifting your finger from the artery's mouth and extinguishing the tallow stick, you find blood still flowing, take another tallow stick with the wheel from among those in the prepared fire. Continue doing this one after another until the bleeding stops.
And remember, do not burn an artery if you encounter one during a procedure; instead perform another operation on the affected area. Understand that when blood has been flowing from the artery, it cannot be properly cut again, especially if it's large. Only four methods are applicable to this: either by cauterizing as we mentioned earlier or by amputating if it hasn't already been done. When amputated, its ends contract and the blood flow stops. Either tie it with a tight suture or apply drugs that prevent blood flow, using clamps to secure them firmly.
As for those who attempt to cut it with a band or by tightening through piercing, or by applying burnt objects and the likes, they won't be able to stop the flow permanently. Except in rare cases where someone encounters this situation without having access to a doctor or medicine, they should place their index finger on the wound as described here.
He tightens it greatly until the blood is contained and drained from above the wound, and on the artery and finger. It cannot be removed with intensely cold water until the blood has凝固and thickened and been cut off. And during this time you look at what he needs of oil or medicine.
The second door.
In the cut, the bulge, the split and the wounds, and similar.
He said, Khalifah mentioned in the first door all diseases for which oiling with fire and burning medicine are suitable, and their reasons and causes, tools, and images of similarities. This was divided into sections from century to antiquity.
And in this chapter, I follow that path with the same approach to ease what the student needs...
Before I start this, you should know my children that in this chapter there is some oil beyond what was in the first chapter of fire.
And for this reason, the caution should be stronger as the work in this section often leads to bleeding. This occurs when a wound is opened on a tumor or bump, or discharge, surgery treatment, extraction of an arrow or cut on a stone and similar situations that accompany all of them with risks and fear, and death occurs in most of them.
And I advise you to avoid falling into matters that could cause suspicion among you, for in this field of work there are many people with various kinds of illnesses. Some have grown accustomed to their illness and despised death.
Due to the severity of what they experience, and its prolonged suffering from illness, along with the certainty that indicates death. Some exert their wealth for you, providing it as a hope for health, but suffering is fatal; so there should be no cooperation among those who are like this in this trait.
Let caution be stronger than your desire and concern. Do not attempt anything without certain knowledge that justifies the desired outcome, and use in all treatments for your patient, advancement of knowledge and warning of what safety may lead to.
If you have it, it will help you in acquiring praise, glory, mention and commendation. May Allah inspire you my children to guide them. Do not prohibit yourselves from correctness and success; indeed, that is within his power. There is no god but He.
And this chapter has been organized into sections based on what was discussed in the previous chapter from the beginning to the end, so that it may alleviate your need for whatever you seek if God wills.
The first section.
In the treatment of water that collects at the heads of infants.
This sore often affects infants at birth if the midwife presses the infant's head roughly, or it may occur for unknown reasons that are not known.
I have not seen this cause in anyone other than infants, and all of those I have seen among them die quickly. That's why I avoid working on them; and indeed, I have seen an infant whose head was filled with water, and the head increases each day. Until the infant could not stand on himself due to the size of his head and the moisture increased until it died.
This moisture either accumulates between the skin and bone or under the bone on the skull. If the moisture is present in the space between the skin and bone and if the tumor is small, it should be necessary to make a single cut across the head, with the length of the cut being about two span lengths, allowing the moisture to drain out. This is the appearance of the incision.
If the moisture is greater and the tumor larger, make it two crossing cuts like this:".
And if the moisture is beneath the bone and its sign is that you can see open sutures from every direction and the water decreases when you squeeze it with your hand into the inside, not hidden from you, then three cuts should be made in the middle of the head as depicted.
Following the cut, all moisture is released. Then stitches are applied to close the cuts and ointments are used from the fifth day onwards. The bandage is removed and the wound is treated with plasters and ointments without over-tightening head bindings. The patient should be fed a dry diet with little moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals. Another method for making cuts is to look at where the bone of the tumor appears and the convergence of water, as it may be at the back of the head or in front or on the right or north.
You refer to the cut where you see the tumor and the water fills up; make cuts as much as possible, taking care to cut a vessel causing bleeding. This will kill the patient from that blood loss, with the expulsion of moisture.
The Second Chapter.
Cutting the two veins behind the ears, known as the Hassan arteries.
When someone experienced severe fevers or chest pains that did not respond to medical treatment after a period of time, it is advised to perform this procedure: cutting these two veins.
If you wish to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a Moses razor. Then, make cuts in the area with a coarse tool so that the vein can be seen. Next, tighten the neck of the patient by using their garment belt. Look at where the pulse beats and the location of the two places behind the ears which are usually visible except for some people.
Then they learn on them with the needle, then cut them with the nail pliers completely up to the bone and this is done width of head; and if you wish you could enter the pliers under the artery and operate upwards by cutting, and the length of cuts would be about two inches.
If the artery is cut, blood flows out in pulsating streams flowing forwards and downwards in a continuous stream. If the artery is not visible to touch, it should be presumed that one can estimate from the ear after measuring three fingers. Then learn with the needle and cut until reaching the bone, and what ought to happen next.
Blood sends out six streams in the middle and it may send more or less; all of this depends on what you perceive from the strength of the patient and the fullness of their arteries. Then, look at the wound; if there is a portion remaining that is connected to the bone from the scrotum, cut it.
In order not to expose heat, the wound is held with a thread from an incision in muslin and then treated with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Dividing the two arteries located in the axilla.
If a person experiences recurrent or severe acute illnesses due to dry heat and temperature fluctuations, headaches that are chronic and intense, among other things, which do not respond to various medical treatments. In such cases, we have tried bleeding the axillary arteries or their sheaths as described, in treating these diseases.
The purpose of the operation in bleeding involves shaving off the hair on the axilla region, specifically referring to the visible artery in the armpit. It becomes apparent from its pulsation; only a little is hidden, except for individual people.
When there is extreme cold and it hides from you, let him hold the back of his loin cloth with the strength of his garment then let you mark the location with a scratch or heat the place with hot water until the artery appears clearly visible. Then take the clamp that is shown here. Then, with this clamp, remove the skin gently until you reach the artery. After that, put a thread on it and pull it up to remove it from the skin. Make sure to get rid of any pus coming from every side. If the artery is thin, roll it with the tip of the thread. Then cut from it a part as much as the distance of its two ends, and squeeze it without causing bleeding. If it doesn't get retracted even if it hasn't peeled or broken, then blood doesn't flow at all. Then drain blood from six to three places.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong double thread. The thread should either be of catgut or from the strings of a violin so that maggots do not hasten before the wound heals and cause bleeding.
Then cut off a preference between the two bands. You do this in that moment or after another time, and if you wish to heat it with an iron file until its ends peel, replacing this operation by itself or better as we said.
'Unless the patient has fever or his mood is disrupted, for heating helps in dissipating moisture and might be more beneficial. It should follow bleeding from both arteries that the area should be filled with dry cotton and bandages should be properly placed. After letting it cool down, he should be treated with moist medicines and oil until he recovers if Allah wills.'
If bleeding occurs during your work from the artery, proceed either with scissors or fill the area with a poultice and hold your hand until the blood stops. If nothing succeeds in stopping it, place your finger to stop the blood.
And cool the area with extreme cold water until the pain subsides and it is tightened as necessary, from what is lighter and easier than bleeding by cutting arteries. After learning the positions with a needle, you should soak with this double-bladed iron after that.
And descend it very gently until it reaches the bone and causes bleeding in two places so that they are apart, for it will not heal with this single-edged iron. This is an image of the iron.
The tips of the two blades resemble small pincers, but they are much less sharp than the blade because if they were as sharp as a blade, the cold would reach them faster and the flesh wouldn't cut quickly. If there's some hardness in them, hold on to their heat with fire.
The flesh cuts quickly, this operation is better than all others and is lighter and easier. Let there be a thickness of the finger's hardness between the blades.
The Fourth Chapter.
In the treatment of excessive, constant bleeding to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and its flow is from the veins on the forehead from outside, and no benefit was obtained from medical treatment with medicines, I saw that the face of the needy had turned red. He feels a stinging on his forehead like that of a wasp, and his eyes are drooping, wet, with their eyelashes hardened from the tears. They tremble from the sharpness of the tears to the extent that they were forced into her treatment by this work, which they call the sword treatment or hair shaving. This is done by ordering the needy person to shave off the hair on his forehead.
Then cut three parallel cuts on the forehead. The length of each cut should be about two fingers, with the first one parallel to the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second slightly off the movement of the muscle at the mouth, and the third from the other side.
And preserve the two veins on each side, keeping your hand away from the connection of the jaws. Leave a space after every cut as wide as three fists to hold an absorbent sponge or many cotton swabs ready to soak blood.
Then insert the sharp clamp's ends, which is what this picture depicts. Then, through the cut from the mouth to the middle cut, you remove all the skin between the two cuts along with the flap above the bone. Then repeat this procedure from the middle cut to the third cut. Finally, take out this clamp. Then, in the first cut as well, you insert another instrument called a sharp scissor on one side and flat and not sharp on the other. This is what it looks like:.
Then, make its sharp side towards the attached flesh and the smooth side towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle cut and cut with it all the blood vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do this from the middle cut to the other cut. After a moderate amount of blood has flowed out, squeeze the places with clotting blood. Then in each cut, stick a cotton thread and place a gauze pad that's soaked in water, oil or honey and oil on it.
To prevent a hot tumor from forming, by the third day, the bandage is removed and a wet poultice is applied often. Then it's treated with balsamic ointment spread on rose water and other remedies used for surgeries until it heals, if God willing.
The Fifth Chapter.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from inside the head.
One had a severe, constant discharge that caused many heavy tears. You see two tiny eyes from him, and his vision has weakened. The eyelids are puffy, and the eyebrows have fallen out; hair is also lost from them. There is severe, painful head pain and continuous coughing deep in the head. If you encounter these symptoms, know that these substances and discharges are coming from numerous deep channels. The best treatment for this situation is to order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single cut down the middle of the forehead.
There is severe, painful head pain and continuous coughing deep in the head. If you encounter these symptoms, know that these substances and discharges are coming from numerous deep channels. The best treatment for this situation is to order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single cut down the middle of the forehead. Or lift it slightly towards the side and start cutting from the left jaw to the right jaw. The cut should reach the bone, and keep your hand away from the movable muscles of the two jaws when chewing until you expose the bone and soak all blood with a sponge.
Divide the edges of the cut with old cotton or a thread from cotton, then pull upwards with the ligatures and drink the ligatures with water and oil to prevent a hot lump. Once you have removed it, if you see that the hot lump has been absorbed, it is necessary to scrape off the bone so that the growth of flesh can begin.
Then treat it with the drying method that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts from flour and four parts of cumin seeds. Prepare a paste from these and use it to promote meat growth in injuries like this.
The Sixth Chapter.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear can be one of four types: either a metallic mineral rock like iron or glass, or a plant seed such as fava beans and seeds alike, or something liquidy like water or vinegar.
And if it is an animal, when a stone or a type of stone that doesn't exceed the ear falls into the ear, receive sunlight with your ear. If you saw something like butter from snail's gland or incision oil sticking in it, then try to remove it by movement of the head or by shaking with the canula. Cure the nosebleeds upon coughing after placing a loop of silk or wool around the ear, and extending the ear upwards. Often, this treatment removes it. If not, try to gently remove it with the soft suction tool depicted here.
Should it be removed with suction and if not, try using a faintly curved thin plunger. If this does not remove it either, make an applewood tube and carefully insert the end of the tube into the ear hole.
Seal around the tube with a thin wick soaked in oil so that there is no way for the wind other than the tube. Pull it with your breath strongly and frequently, often this removes it. If it did not come out as described, take a piece of broom sugar or a small portion of the bird sucking tool and place it at the tip of the suction tool.
After tightly winding it with cotton, gently insert it into the ear hole after wiping out the moisture from the ear. If it did not come out with all that we described, proceed to the incision before a hot tumor or convulsion occurs.
The description for the incision is to cut open the wax in the ear canal first, and remove as much blood as its strength permits. Then place the wax between your hands, turn its back upwards, and make a small incision at the top of the ear lobe where the fat under it is low.
The cut is made in a crescent shape until it reaches the stone, then remove it with whatever you can from machines. Afterwards, suture the cut as quickly as possible and treat it until it heals.
And if the object that has fallen into the ear is one of the grains that grow and inflate, try to remove it with what we have mentioned. If that does not work for its removal, take a thin, smoothawl according to this image.
And try to cut this type of grain that has fallen into the ear with it. You should do this only if you are certain that the grain has become small pieces due to the steam in the ear. Then, remove it using a dark lamp, or a soft spatula, or by suction through a tube.
As we mentioned, it helps to remove it, and as for the water that has entered the ear, it should be used with the camel's snout first. The camel's snout fills his ear with a little cotton while he is lying on the ear containing water, and if it comes out like this.
And if that fails, take a lot of small, smooth pebbles and heat them slightly with fire. The camel then inserts one of these pebbles into its ear and blows on each foot in that direction, striking another stone against the stone inside the ear.
He continues doing this with pebble after pebble until all the water is removed, and he can remove the water by taking one of the camel's hair or feathers and inserting one end into the ear, then heating the other end until it burns most of it off. Then he replaces another feather.
You do this multiple times until all the water is removed or you draw it out with the tube as previously mentioned in pebbles. As for extracting the animal that has entered, look, if it's small like a thorn and the like, treat it with what was mentioned in the section and otherwise.
If his body is large and accessible to touch, try to remove it with forceps and hooks. This makes the removal easier than all other methods used on the ear. As for removing the built-up wax in the ear if treated as mentioned in the section regarding ear conditions under topic of 'Cerumen,' and if your treatment did not succeed.
You should look into the ear in sunlight. If you see some wax, remove it with forceps or gentle hooks. If you don't see anything from them, take this tube and photograph its appearance.
It should be narrow at the bottom and wide on top. Gently insert a soft tip into the ear as far as it can go without causing discomfort. Then, forcefully pull it out (the wax) several times until all of it has been removed. If it doesn't come out easily, seal around the tube with beeswax as I have instructed you regarding the stone extraction.
If it doesn't come out as we have instructed, use the tools mentioned earlier which were first tried to kill wax and can be found in the section on ear conditions. You will find your application of oils and medicines in the ear using this device, and here is its depiction:.
As you see, it is made from silver or brass. It should be narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. You can choose to have the wad inside the tube's chamber made of tightly packed brass if desired, or leave it loose and wrap cotton tightly on its tip.
Then, pour the oil or juice or whatever medicine you want into the tube and place it in your ear. Then, insert the wad of cotton on top and squeeze with your hand moderately until the oil flows into the ear canal, making sure to apply pressure evenly.
Within the ear, and whatever you put in the ear should be slightly warmed by fire. Be cautious that which is inserted into it neither be too cold nor too hot. For the ear cannot bear this.
The Seventh Chapter.
In Treating the Obstruction in the Ear.
Some children may be born without being cut, and their mothers' wombs and ears may not have been incised.
It may also expose some people to having an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or a remnant of flesh there. This obstruction could be at the depth of an ear hole that cannot be seen by sight.
It might extend slightly outside the hole and be noticeable by sight. The one that appears deep in the ear and is not visible, will usually have difficulty being seen. The one that can be seen, you should place the ear of Albucasis towards the sun. And look inside, and if you see the obstruction clearly, open it with a gentle forceps. Its appearance would be like this:.
One of its ends will have a slight projection that is somewhat limited, and the rest of the forceps is smooth to avoid injuring the ear. If the obstruction consists of flesh that has grown inside the ear canal, hold it with a gentle pair of pincers and cut it gently until all the flesh is extracted.
If the obstruction is deep in the ear, take a gentle smooth lever and slightly warm it in fire. Then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction along with what Albucasis feels from the loss of hearing, gently push it out slowly.
And beware not to injure the nerve of the ear, then insert a wick into the ear up to the size of the hole as it was dipped in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are safe from the wound sticking together or take a piece of a wick dip it in water and sprinkle it with the medicine powder.
Use it, should I see the ear swollen and insert a hot thing, it would be necessary for the wick to come out and replace it with another one that has been soaked in rose oil so as to calm the hot tumor. Then treat it until it heals.
If there is a bleeding, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear. Use all treatments that stop the mentioned bleeding as described in the article of the birds.
The eighth chapter.
In treating the spots that appear on the cheeks.
These spots that appear on the eyelids can be wet or dry. It is necessary to pinch them with tweezers or a clamp and cut them from their root using scissors. Then apply a powdered medicine on the spot while pressing it gently.
If it bleeds, squeeze it with a soft lens press and make sure to clean the area after cutting. Often, if there's still something left from its root, it will recur, and if you burn the roots with fire, those roots are destroyed and do not return.
The ninth chapter.
In treating the cold affecting the cheeks of the eye.
Very often, something resembling cold in its intensity and hardness appears on the cheeks.
Therefore, it is called cold which is the gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelid. In dealing with this, if you look closely to see that the cold protrudes from the surface of the eyelid, move it towards every direction; its removal would be easier so split it across its width.
Then, cut it off gently from all sides until it completely escapes. Hang it with the clamp and cut it. If you are unable to cut it down, wait until the eyelid heals after the cutting procedure; this will not harm the patient. If the cut is large, sew up its edges and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, do not worry about it because the ointment will force it and adhere it. If the cold pack leans towards inside of the eyelid toward the inner surface, flip the eyelid and hang the cold pack with a string without needing to make a cut or penetrate it from each side.
If you cut through the eyelid during the process, it will not cause any harm. Then wash the eye with salt water after removing the cold pack and treat the area with something that promotes healing until the eye dries properly.
The tenth chapter.
In treating the condition that affects the eyelid.
The condition known as squint occurs in the layers of the upper eyelid. This is more common among boys and it causes their eyes to be heavier, making them prone to night blindness and unable to look directly into sunlight. In order that the tears speed up for them.
Therefore, you see them leaning on their faces constantly and they sleep with it. Their foreheads are wet due to the blowing and the condition of squint is evident to the eye; when you press on that area with your fingers, you can feel the squint between them. The purpose of this treatment is for the patient to place his head in a depression in your hand.
Then, take a thread of cotton and prepare a wick from it. Make a circle out of this wick that encompasses the squint on all sides as much as possible. Place it on the squint and press it with your fingers from all sides to collect the squint in the center of the circle.
Then, with the nipping device, cut a horizontal groove in the middle of this moisture. The cut should not be larger than the one made on the fold and in depth, it is necessary to cut the entire skin until you reach the squint.
In most cases, the excised tissue appears as a white fatty piece projecting from the incision. You should extract it by prying it out with your fingers wrapped around it, moving your hand back and forth until you remove it entirely. Be cautious not to deepen the cut as this could cause the clamp to touch the eye and potentially harm it.
If the excised tissue does not appear in the first incision, you should gently extend the cut a little more until it does. Then extract the tissue as we have said. Next, dip a splint into a solution of vinegar and water and place it on the area, then firmly press it with your thumb. Some people use salt to compress the wound instead.
He places it in the cavity of the incision to dissolve the remaining moisture, then treats it until it heals. If there is a spot of heat on the area, he applies a soothing poultice until it heals.
The eleventh chapter.
In various types of eye inflammation.
If a tumor grows on the eyelid, it forms excess tissue above the natural path beneath the normal lashes. If left untreated, this can harm the eye and lead to various diseases such as constant watering of the eyes, drooping eyelids, whitening of the eye, and hardening, which may result in the loss of vision.
Eye inflammation can occur in four ways: either by rubbing with fire, as described earlier in the section about rubbing, or with certain medications. Alternatively, it could result from cutting and stitching, or by using a stick, as mentioned previously.
You should place the patient's head on a stone and then use your left hand to turn the eyelid. If it turns, you're done; otherwise, insert an needle with thread from under the lower lid and pass the needle and thread through from above, making sure they are close to the hair line and pulling the thread upwards using the eyelid.
Manipulate it with a stick, then cut in the inner eyelid without the excess hair. Make cuts from the major maeque to the minor maeque, then extract the thread. Place a small pad of cotton or linen under the eye lid and stitch the eyelid using silk.
Like the shape of an ace card, but it should be at a level that you desire in raising the eyelid since this can vary among people; some may need to cut from the eyelid as much as suits their relaxed eyelids.
Some need to cut less of that based on the relaxation of the eyelid, then make cuts with forceps along the lines you've taught and start from the major maeque to the minor maeque. Each cut is near the natural hair line by as much as a stick's thickness.
Then, the suturing tool enters one of the skin's corners and removes it all. Then, stitch the lips together with a needle and fine silk thread, cleaning off any blood. After that, stick any remaining threads to some hanging items on the eyebrows if necessary.
You may do it if you wish, or otherwise it doesn't matter. The stitches and threads will remain for about three to four days. Then treat the wound, or you might leave the wound without stitches and treat it with things that dry and tighten. The eyelid rises when the wound is sealed and reunited, and stitching is better.
This aspect of suturing I mentioned at the beginning, except that it has a burden on the patient. However, it is effective and safe with no risk involved. Another point about suturing is to stitch the eyelid in a shape like an ace card as described. Then raise the eyelid with three needles which can be separated or grouped in this way:
Then cut what is superfluous from the eyelid with small scissors according to this image, cutting it in moderation.
If you cannot hold the needles and fail to pierce, take an awl with a thread in it, insert it in the middle of the figure, then insert another thread near the larger spine, and another thread near the smaller spine. Gather the threads between your fingers moderately, then lift your hand gradually.
Then lift the taught skin as we described. Sew together the wound's lips with stitching, and treat it until it heals. If a hot lump appears when you cut or incise, cool that lump using camphor and other soothing ointments.
And the lower eyelid may also cause its lashes to flip outwards, in which case you should use the cutting and stitching techniques we have mentioned. You can cool it with fire or medicine, or using fire or sharp medicine. Cooling is more merciful than cutting and sewing, and cutting and sewing are more severe in both cases.
The treatment with the splint involves turning the eyelid and making an incision from inside as described, then create two or three splints each one slightly longer than the length of the eyelid and thinner than its width.
I've lent at their ends from both sides where the threads stick, then gently gather them on what is preferred of the eyelid and pull both splints firmly from both sides. Leave it for a while, for the tightened skin dies, becomes dark and rotten.
Until it falls off itself, if you are slow in doing so, lend her another splint then treat until she heals. If it becomes swollen the eyelid rises and the eye lashes do not recede. This is how you make the two splints exactly like this shape and size:...
The twelfth chapter.
In lifting the dead hair from the eye by needle.
If it is a hair or two hairs to work on that, take a fine needle and insert in it a thread of very fine silk. Then gather its ends and tie them loosely together; let the length of the string be about a foot long.
Then, in the apparatus another thread is placed shorter than the first and if desired its ends are tied together. Then the patient lies down on a stone near to the sun so that the operation can be seen clearly; it's a delicate task after all, then pierce the needle through the apparatus at the root of the protruding hair.
And then she performs it under the eyelid so that it comes out above the natural hair, then draws the thread upwards over the apparatus and enters this thread into the apparatus; if it is one or two hairs or three at most.
Then you pull your hand with it until the hair comes out from under the eyelid together with natural hair. If you pulled the apparatus and did not get the hair, pull the apparatus down with the thread that was in it to get the apparatus out from the top hole.
Then place the hair back and pull them. Do this until it rises from the top hole, you see her in your eye then loosen the apparatus and thread, take them out and pull tight on the eye for two or three days so that she stays in place and flesh grows over the hair.
If the hair is short, either you add to it a long hair from natural hair so that it rises with her or leave it until she grows longer after some time then lift it up.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the treatment of the tearing that occurs in the upper eyelid.
The tearing that affects this is called an Arnheim tear. This tearing can either be natural or accidental. An accidental tearing results from a wound, incision, or laceration, and so forth.
The purpose of the treatment is to cut through this conglomeration, spreading the two sides apart and creating a thread of cotton between them. It should be tied until it heals. There should not be used in its treatment things that dry up and contract.
If you do that, the tearing returns worse than before. Instead, use things that relax like a ring or a clamp with water in which I've floated my line and cotton balls, mixed with a little lye soap, rubbed with fennel oil after mixing it with some fat, then treated her with it.
The treatment for this involves using every trick to prevent it from healing in the same way as before. This work we've mentioned is a kind of repair for the tearing, not to restore the place's condition according to its original state.
The fourteenth chapter.
In the treatment of tearing that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This kind of tearing, which occurs at the bottom, is actually called an "eye tear" and can be either natural or accidental. An accidental tearing results from a wound, incision, or laceration, among other things.
The method of treatment involves taking a needle with two threads and piercing the flesh, then passing it from the left groove to the right until the thread is in both ends of the flesh. Then stretch the flesh upwards by the needle and cut it with a wide scissor.
If the eyelid returns to its original shape, otherwise take a thread and place it on the site of the cut, then turn the lid over and make two cuts in the inner side of the lid, with each end of the cuts being from the corners of the cut area until they meet, thus creating an angle. Even if they meet, its shape will resemble this form:.
And it is the Greek letter lambda, then remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp edge is below the eyelid, then bring together the separated parts with two stitches and sew them with a wool thread. Then treat it with the relaxant and restorative medicines as we mentioned until it heals.
And if the incision or stitch or cut was affected by a beard hair, then you should make a simple cut without touching any hair as previously mentioned. Then separate between the lips with a thread as we described.
And the rule in treating an incision made from above or below is to perform the operation according to how you find the condition of the incision, as it may vary significantly in appearance. The surgeon devises the trick with any means possible that suits him.
Until the shape returns to its natural condition or approaches it. And the same disease guides you in what operation and instrument is suitable for him most of the time,
Chapter Fifteen.
In joining the eyelid to the eyelash or cornea.
This kind of joining might cause many to bind the upper eyelid with the white part of the eye, which prevents it from moving easily and hinders its natural functions. It is necessary to insert a thread tip under the eyelid.
Raise it up or extend it with a stitch, then cut the connection with a soft incision tool that is not sharp as to cut the ligaments. It should be barely there so as not to cause concern when working on it, allowing the incision tool to harmlessly touch the eye.
Expect until even if the eyelid returns to its natural state and all the connection is cleared, then you should then put water that has turned sour into the eye to wash it with it or spray it in the nostrils of the sand rat which had been dissolved in water. Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a thread made of cotton.
Place wool that is soaked with the white of egg over the eye. After the third day, use the used sand rats until it is cleared.
The sixteenth chapter.
In cutting the hoof and removing its inner flesh.
An osseous nail is of two types, either it is nervous and resembles a hard, thin plate like a hoof, or it is non-nervous resembling hardened white moisture when touched by iron or when taken with a stitch it gets cut.
And if no stitch is to be inserted in it, and both these types, they are begun from the inner corner of the eye until a small amount of light dimness spreads covering the viewer and preventing light and eye movement, and the work is performed by having the surgeon place his head on your stone.
And then he opens his eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand. Then, you catch the hoof with a slightly bent stitch and raise it up. Then, you take a needle and insert a hair from horse or cow's hair, strong thread into one end of the needle to bend it a bit, and pierce it in the center of the hoof.
The operation is performed with a needle, the eyebrow is connected by thread, and it is stretched upwards. The hair above the eyebrow that follows the eyelash is cut as if spreading it with hair to its end, then the rest of the moustache is cut in the root area using a gentle pair of scissors or a small pair of scissors, leaving the natural moustache intact.
So as not to allow the constant weeping of tears, the eyebrow is tied with only a thread or string as we said, then cut with an extremely smooth pair of scissors like this:
And to avoid the scissors coming into contact with the corneal membrane causing a tear, then after cutting, put some powdered salt or snail slime in the eye and leave it until the next day, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the eyebrow is not sensitive and cannot be penetrated by a needle or a string can't be implanted in it, this type of eyebrow is often treated with medication as described in the section, if you want to cut it, open the eye of the needy.
Take a smooth, gentle pair of scissors like this: Gently remove the eyebrow above by scraping, if you see that it is breaking and crumbling and affecting only the scraping with your hand in snail slime or red scabs or powdered salt, pull the eye tight until the next day.
Then, continue the operation on her until all is gone, except if it obstructs in the eye and there is a hot lump, leave it and treat the hot lump until it heals, then continue scraping work on her until she heals. As for me, I let grow the moustache.
If the eye is injured by the entry of a foreign body, an intense and terrible damage occurs. He should attach that foreign body to the surgical thread, cut off some of it, do not excessively cut for fear of causing weeping tears, then cut in the depressions under the red scabs or the snail until it heals.
The seventeenth chapter.
In cutting the varicelli and what grows as excess flesh in the eye.
Some people's eyes may grow red flesh that accumulates until it covers the retina, approaches or overflows onto the cheeks. In some cases, the cheeks might turn outwards resembling the varicelli of the jilette animal.
The procedure involves having the patient place their head on your pillow, then open their eyes. With instruments compatible to that, you should gather all of the red flesh completely.
Or, tie it with a stick or a hoe, then cut the first piece of flesh one by one until you completely remove all of it and protect the eye so as not to harm it during your work. Your cut may either be using the gouge we described in cutting the bone, or with a small scissor. Like those used to catch sables as depicted in this illustration on the next page of this book.
Once your cutting is done and all the varicelli have been removed, fill the eye with saltwater or sprinkle red powders and similar medicines inside to cool down any inflammation. Then place a piece of egg white cotton outside the eye for protection against infection.
If there is still some varicelli left and the blood clot remains, fearing inflammation, leave the eye alone and treat it with what soothes inflammation. Then resume work on it until it heals. Likewise, do this for excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
Except that you should avoid treating every weak eye through imprinting or exposure, and do not engage in actions involving iron until you see that the organ is suitable for this treatment.
The eighteenth chapter.
In the section of sifting for the eye.
The splotches are red threads that weave on the eye, preventing vision and weakening it over long days. It is necessary for you to first look, if the eye with splotches is strong and there's no other disease except for splotches.
Then, when this is the case, the operation consists in commanding the patient to put his head on your shoulder. Then hang those threads using one or two hooks depending on what you find comfortable, and ensure that the hooks are gentle as follows:".
Or have two double hooks in one body, like this:".
Then, with a gentle pair of scissors, you should gently grasp those threads and remove the blood from time to time until you see that the eye is free from these threads and the blood has dispersed. Be cautious not to harm the eye with the edges of the scissors, and let your work be half the day facing the sun.
And you should diligently maintain your work so that you do not cut anything other than those threads. When you finish, sharpen in the green or red inner part of the eye to eat away whatever is left of the splotches. If you are unable to sift all of it during this time, bind the eye with what calms eye pain.
And leave him for a few days until his pain subsides and the hot lump settles. Then, repeat this work on this condition with the same eye until you remove this image of pain from it.
When you do this [referring to a procedure], the head of the blind person will be in the stone of the student, and the other end lets tears flow and verifies the vision at the front of the eye and its back. The main principle is that one should open the eye with fixed or triangular openings held by the apprentice.
Facing the patient, having the head of the blind person on the teacher's stone. The end allows tears to flow and verifies vision at the front of the eye and its back. By choice, you can start from above the eye or below it. First, two tears are drawn in the upper horn, one in the end of the eyelash ring, and the other in its beginning.
Grasp it between the middle and the saphenous then connect two tubes opposite each other. Then grasp it between the inguinal ligament and the pubic bone, lift your hand slightly to see all the vessels rise. Cut from the smaller western side if you use scissors and gently with a gentle file if you use a rasp.
And you guide the needle through the vessels, ensuring that you can see all of them until they rise above the scab, but do not cut the tears. For if the tears and blood leak out, it will be troublesome for you.
Then, cut with scissors what is above and below the eyelash ring until only the cilia remains. If possible, you can lift it from the ciliary body; scraping with a tool is better as it's more effective though some may find it easier.
If you cut it, the wound will remain for days, with pain subsiding and swelling of the inflamed area. Then resume its treatment.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In redirecting the feather towards the nose.
The physicians refer to the down as the Nacura, if they treat it with fire or the hot drug as described previously and it does not heal. There is no trickery other than to cut into the tumor when it is ripe and extract all of the moisture in it or pus.
Until the bone is revealed. If the bone is revealed and you see decay or discoloration within, remove it with this tool as depicted below:.
The grater head is called, made of Indian iron. Its head is cylindrical like a rasp with delicate engravings from the bur or the file, which it has on its surface. You place it onto the area infected in the bone and then turn it between your fingers while slightly moving your hand until you realize that this decay has been removed.
You perform this action several times, then apply the powdered drugs to the place. If the area closes up and new flesh begins to grow there, and if it stops bleeding after a certain period, and if forty days pass with no recurrence, no relapse, and no incident occurring thereafter.
Know that if it has healed, otherwise there is no trick other than to return the nostril's down in this manner. This involves exposing the bone again using iron or a hot drug. If the bone is exposed, take hold of it like so:.
The tip of the probe is triangular, its shaft conical, tapering towards the tip as you can see. Place it on the bone itself; have it close to the nose and slightly away from your eye. Then turn your hand with the tool until the bone penetrates and touches the patient.
So when he holds his hand over his nose, you should force the area with the powdered and dried drugs as I have taught you. If new flesh begins to grow and harden in that spot, then the substance that used to flow out will return to the nostril. This is lighter for the patient, if God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
The excerpt is translated to: "Let's operate on the eye.
If the eye is injured by its socket and there's no harm or loss in vision, it should be made to undergo a simplification procedure then it should be detailed during excision. Afterward, it should be put back into place without any stipulation and a fine suction should be performed.
Then, place on the eye a poultice made of argoil, patience and milk curd. Then lift the eye from above with many ligatures. The prescription for these ligatures is to take fine ashes that will bend each incision into four layers, which creates numerous of them.
Then, place it one on top of another according to what the eye needs. Then pull it with a strong hard incision and repeat the suction through the wound without any stipulation. Afterward, remove the suction cup and leave the eye bound for one day and one night.
If the ligament relaxes during this period, it should be pulled gently. Then remove the bandage after one day and one night as we said. If I see that the eye has returned, otherwise repeat applying the bandages, ligatures, suction until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cutting the anbija (a type of fruit).
If a fissure occurs in the anbija layer, then it gets exposed and protrudes outside the eyelids like raisins, spoiling the appearance of man. Therefore, if you want to cut it, proceed as described here.
And that is to insert a needle in the root of the raisin from bottom to top, then to insert another needle with a double thread from the inside corner side and to pass it through, letting the first needle remain as it was.
Then cut the crossing needle's knot and tie some thread around the needle with some grape leaves, then tighten it tightly. After that, remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye, leaving it until the threads along with the grape leaves fall off. Then treat the eye to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals, tighten the grape leaves from every side in a circular motion until the eye becomes smooth. Then gently press with a thin implement reaching to the corner of the eye so that the white liquid can drain and the eye will sink down and swell on its place. Afterwards, tighten it until it heals.
The Second Twenty Chapter.
In the treatment of cancer.
This condition, known as cancer, is a period that gathers in the eye resembling water that has fallen but lacks substance. The purpose of treatment in this case is to have the patient sit upright on a chair and then hold the head with your hands from both sides.
Move it until the duration descends to your eye, then fix it and don't remove it. Light will appear and the patient will see things as he used to see them. If it doesn't descend down, we know that it is water. If the duration isn't ready for falling according to what we mentioned, then you will have noticed.
Otherwise, sit the patient between your hands then take a thin implement and slightly cut above the conjunctiva's membrane just at the connection of the adhesive with the conjunctiva in the sclera until you remove the substance.
If it comes out, there appears hot water that has been mixed with honey or boiled milk and honey in the eye. Then you should treat it with all other treatments until it heals.
Chapter XIII.
We have mentioned the types of water in the division and which ones are suitable for use as eye drops with a clarified explanatory statement. If you take it according to its health benefits, then at that point, it would be necessary for you to sit comfortably between your eyes facing towards the light close to the sun.
And tie the correct eye tightly, then lift his eyelid with your left hand if the eye with water is the left eye or with your right hand if it's the right eye.
Then place the tip of the pipette near the eyelashes with a firm pressure in the same white part of the eye from the inner corner. Then push the pipette with force while you move it with your hand until it penetrates into the white of the eye and you feel that the pipette has reached an empty space.
And you should make the distance of the pipette going to depth equal to the distance that there is between the child and the last black part, which is the eyelash. You will see the copper in the same viewer as what you see with your eye for the clarity of the corneal membrane, then let the pipette go up to the position where the water is located.
Then press it down one after another. If the water has fallen from its container, then the patient sees what was opened for his eyes in his container and the pipette is in his eye, then he stays a little while. If the water ascends, then let it fall again without removing the pipette.
And if it has settled and does not ascend, then remove the pipette gently while you move your hand with it a little bit at a time. Then dissolve some pure underground salt in water and wash the eye from inside. Afterwards, place all of it (the outer part) of the eye either with wadding or cotton that's been dipped.
Ghee, whitened by egg white and correctly tied with the correct eye. However, us and contemporaries place ground nutmeg together with egg white on it. If you cannot enter through the eye due to its hardness because there are people whose eyes are extremely hard. You should take the clamp which is called 'the postman' as depicted:
Penetrate it with the clamp just once and do not linger on the puncture; instead, gently touch where you would insert the probe as previously mentioned. Upon completing your task, prepare for the anaesthetist to lie down comfortably on his back in a dark room.
And refrain from all movements, and do not induce coughing. Feed him food that softens his nature and does not allow him to move his head right or left at all. Keep the bandage in place until the third day, then let him recover in this dark room, and test his vision.
Show him objects then loosen the bandage up to the seventh day. It should not be done during the healing process or immediately after the puncture, but it should be avoided before the water rises quickly due to intense gaze.
If a hot tumor appears, the eye should be released before the seventh day and this is done by calming the tumor until it subsides. Then, allow vision and place him in a turban, he will practice his vision from under it for days while he's still in that dark room.
He gradually leaves the house and deals with his responsibilities. Understand that drilling does not allow the learner to do without observation sometimes, when he then proceeds to work. I have heard from some Iraqis that they mentioned an Iraqi probe that absorbs water.
I have not seen anyone in our country do this or read about it in an early book. Perhaps this is new, and here are some types of mistakes due to her ignorance:
She makes it from copper specially, and its tip is that sharpness in one place like a triangle with a sharp point.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In treating the oozing flesh in the nose.
Growth of various kinds of flesh in the nose may occur. Some resemble spiders with many legs, some are cancerous flesh that is hard like a red color, and there are others that are soft flesh not like a red color.
If the flesh is soft and not toxic or cancerous, it should be placed under your hand where the sun can shine on it. Open its mouth and pour salt water into this flesh then draw it out again. Cut what you have found in it with a sharp fine scissor from one side only.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone, if there remains something that you cannot cut, remove it gently with one of the smooth machines until nothing is left. If the blood overcomes or appears, or a hot tumor occurs.
If it is faced with what should be or was from the toxic tumors, act quickly by removing its contents until blood stops and all flesh has been eliminated. Then place in the nose after cutting a solution of vinegar and water or a drink if the nose opens and collects moisture into the throat.
Know that he has been cleansed, if moisture does not reach as it should then know that inside there is oozing flesh on the upper bones that have decayed and the machine did not reach its cut. In that case, you should take a piece of cotton thread which has some stiffness to it.
In it are many knots and she makes between each knot a span or less. The surgeon then turns the thread into his nose using a hook or whatever he can after having made it like a needle, pulling air until he reaches the nostril.
And it comes out on his neck. Often boys do this action in the writers, it is an easy thing for those who want to, then the two ends of the thread that came out from the mouth and the other which remained in the nose gather.
And she uses spreading the flesh by using the knots in the thread. She does this until she learns that the tissues have broken by the thread's knots, then she takes out the thread and goes into the nose after wiping the bleeding wounds she got from the Egyptian ointment. She does this for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all that is left of the tissues, then it becomes the last thing in the nose a lead pipe for days until it heals. If she needed treatment, she used to dry this.
And this is a picture of the inhaler with which ointments and medicines drip in the nose:.
He places one made of silver or brass, somewhat like a small candle open at the waxy end and with its hollow part also waxed.
And if you wish, you can make the tube closed like a pipe and make the inhaler surface smooth.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when you heat the oil or any other juice or liquid things that you want.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In the nasopharynx at the tip of the nose.
It frequently grows into the nostril causing harm which increases with time until it spoils its appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut off its first appearance and remove all of it. Then apply something either as a patch or medicated burning for the purpose of the patch, if you miss cutting it off at first it might increase in size. Observe, if it has become thick and hard like red skin with little sensation,
Do not expose it to iron, as it is a cancerous tumor. I have seen many cases where the removal of this tumor has led to a great suffering for its owner. However, if the tumor is soft and not as hard as red skin and I found that complete removal is possible in such cases. Drain out the pus and cut it without fear or hesitation, then treat the area with what dries and constricts until it heals.
The twenty-sixth chapter.
In suturing the nose, lips and ears. If there is a separation from the connection or something like that, know that if an interruption of connection has occurred in one of these organs, it will not be effective for treatment except in some people.
If you need to expose something from this, observe if the wound is tender with its blood that you stitch up her lips and then treat it until it heals. If separation of connection has separated both her lips and each cut becomes healthy, you should excise each cut until it bleeds.
Then stitch the lips together, tighten it and apply chewed cheese and yogurt on it. Place some ointment above the stitches, such as ghee or other greases, then leave it tightened for two or three days before removing the bandage.
The change of medicine and leaving it until the threads detach from each other on their own, then treating it with ointment until healing occurs. The stitches' prescription is to gather, disperse reconnection either by needle as we described in stitching the abdomen or by thread as you were taught there.
The twenty-seventh chapter.
In releasing the knots that are displayed in the two lips.
Many people may exhibit small, hard lumps inside their mouths that resemble pimple lesions in some cases and are smaller or larger in others. It is necessary to flip the lip, cut through each knot, and attach it to the thread.
And cut it from each side, then fill the place after cutting with a poultice to stop bleeding. Then rinse with vinegar, salt and treat the areas until they heal.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In cutting the excess flesh in the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums which the ancients called 'apols'. It is necessary to attach it with a thread or hold it with a saw and cut it at its root. Then leave the wound to bleed for a while before applying a poultice made of powder.
Or one of the contracted drippings that have been dried. If this flesh returns after treatment, it often returns thicker; so cut and suture it again. Then, it doesn't return after cutting.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In拔牙 using iron.
Hard, unpleasant scales may accumulate on the surfaces of teeth from inside and outside as well as between gums. They can darken, discolor and turn green; this decay can spread to gums causing erosion of teeth.
In order to do this, you should have the patient lying between your hands and his head on your stone. You should remove all pubic hair and tooth that has grown out with the scales or resembles sand until nothing remains from it. Similarly, you should do this for soot, greenery, chalk, and other things, in order to clean.
If there is any left of the first cleaning, then sheathe him another day and again on the second and third until you reach your desired goal. And know that pubic hair needs various shaped cloths for sheathing in many forms depending on what suits your work.
In order for the sheathing cloth that is used from inside when removing pubic hair to be different from the one used from outside, and the one used between hairs in another form. These are several types of sheathing cloths that you have all ready:
The thirty-first chapter.
In extract the teeth.
It is necessary to treat the pubic hair from its itching with every means and not to hesitate to remove it, for there is no alternative if you remove it, because it is a noble essence, even if removing it becomes necessary.
It is necessary that if the patient decides to remove his pubic hair, he should shave until you get clean and painless pubic hair. Often, the patient is deceived by the pain and thinks it's in the correct pubic hair, so he pulls it out. But the pain doesn't go away until the patient removes his pubic hair; we've seen this done repeatedly by barber surgeons.
If you have clean pubic hair with pain in a specific place, then it is necessary to cut around the tooth with a pronged tool where there is some strength, so that the gum comes off from all sides. Then, move it (the tooth) with your fingers or soft needles little by little until it loosens.
Then he enabled the two large dogs well and placed the head of the impotent man between his knees, having thickened it so that it does not move. Then he pulls the penis straight to avoid breaking it, if it does not come out or else take one of these instruments and gently insert it under him from each side as you did first with a back and forth movement.
And if the penis is too thick or contracted, it should be filled with a splint and blocked firmly with a soft, twisted end so that it does not come off when you pull on it with your testicles. And you should dig around the gum around the shaft smoothly from all sides.
And make an effort to avoid breaking it, for some of it will return on him through the act which is more painful than his first pain. Do not do what fools among surgeons do in their bridge by attempting to remove it without using what we have described.
Many times, they cause great suffering to people that is worse than if the penis breaks and leaves all of its roots or some of them. Otherwise, it may be that some of the jawbone is removed as we have seen repeatedly. After removal, it should be rinsed with a drink or a salt and water solution. If there is bleeding from the site, which often happens, press on it for a moment with a piece of gauze and apply pressure to the area.
Otherwise, if gauze does not help you, the image of the soft testicles which move the penis at first should be long and have a short handle that doesn't bend when you hold it with your fingers. This is the image of large testicles:.
Be thick as seen, so that when you hold it, it doesn't give or bend easily. It should be of Indian iron or well-tempered steel with short limbs and at its end it has teeth that enter each other slightly for a firm and tight grip.
And the extremities can be made like a clamp, thus it also becomes strong for adjustment.
The fifth and thirteenth sections.
In removing the roots of the teeth and extracting broken bones from the sockets.
If the root of the tooth remains after extraction and it has broken, you should place cotton saturated with oil on the site for a day or two until the area relaxes. Then you introduce the pincers or forceps into the socket. Those which resemble the beaks of birds, specifically the bird known as the plucker, and this is an image of forceps:.
It should be made like a clamp from inside or like a forceps, if you can't use this kind of forceps for extraction, then you should dig into the root and expose all the tissue with the pincers. Then you will introduce an instrument that resembles a small pliers, as shown:.
Short at the tip, somewhat thick but not too smooth so as not to break when the root comes out. Otherwise, use this other instrument shown here; it has a triangular end with some thickness:.
A soft triangular image:.
We can also use this type of instrument with two parts as shown here:.
And with other tools and instruments that are mentioned in the list for removing teeth, we can also use this instrument that resembles a large anvil as shown here:.
Triangle of the corrected finger has a slight roughness in it so that it does not break and is not slippery. Know that tools for nail work are many, likewise all other tools are numerous and cannot be counted. The skilled maker of roads, guided by his work and the diseases themselves, may invent machines according to what they indicate.
Because there are diseases for which the first inventors did not create tools for their variety, if a bone from the jaw or any bone in the mouth breaks or decays, look for its place with what suits it of one of these tools and mechanisms that I mentioned in the extraction of principles.
And we rely on this pair of his image:.
There should be a slight roughness to adjust the bone so that it doesn't slip, even until the bone comes out. We apply medications suitable for this purpose to fix its position. If there is decay in the bone, remove it from its decay and darkness until it cleans up, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
In spreading the newly growing nails onto another one.
If nails grow out of their natural groove, they become distorted in appearance. This is especially noticeable and problematic in women and slaves. If the nail has grown behind another nail, it should be examined.
If it cannot be spread or retracted, remove it. If it is stuck to another nail, cut it with this tool as shown in this image:.
It resembles a small billhook and should be made of very sharp Indian iron. You will need to cut it many times due to the hardness of the nail and so as not to disturb other nails. If it is one that can bend easily, bend it with an Indian reamer which would have this appearance.
Everything originates from India and its engraving is finely done to resemble the needle-making process. The blade cools slightly over a long period of time with care, so as not to disturb the edge that might fall off, then it is sharpened again using some fine abrasives.
And if some of the edge has broken off, it can harm the tongue when speaking. It would be advisable to cool it down until that roughness of the break disappears, and until it becomes smooth without harming the tongue or distorting speech.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In twisting moving needles with threads of silver or gold.
If the old needles are exposed, they may tremble or move out of place due to a strike or fall, and the patient is unable to eat anything for fear of them falling out. Treating this with adhesive drugs did not help.
The trick is to tighten a thread of gold or silver; gold is better as silver tends to rust and deteriorate after days, whereas gold remains unchanged forever and isn't exposed to that. The thread should be appropriately firm or thick according to the space between the needles.
A picture of the twisting: take the thread and place its bend between two correct needles, then weave both ends of the thread among one or more moving needles until you weave to the correct needle from the other side.
Then, repeat the weaving from where you started and gently tighten your hand so that the moving parts don't move. Your thread tension should be at the ends of the needles to prevent them from slipping away. Then cut off the excess thread with scissors, join the two ends together, tie them with a knot, and hide them between the correct needle and the moving needle.
In order to prevent the tongue from bleeding, then leave it like this tied up for what remains. If it dissolved or broke its thread, tie it again with another string so that you can enjoy it like this throughout your life. This is an illustration of the clamps and the configuration in two fixed forceps and two movable forceps as you see here:
And the single or both forceps may return after falling back to their place and intertwining as we described, remaining. It is done by a companion maker of tracks, and he may engrave bone from cow bones in order to make it resemble a forceps and places it at the spot where the forceps had gone. And it is tightened as we said, remaining and enjoying it.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In cutting the band that is presented under the tongue to prevent speech.
This band that is presented under the tongue can either be natural, which humans are born with, or it can be accidental from a healed wound.
The process involves opening the mouth of the patient and placing their head on a table, then lifting their tongue. You should cut this nerve band across until the tongue is released from its restraint. If there's some stiffness or complexity in it due to healed wound remnants, insert a metal rod diagonally cutting across it until you break the band, thus alleviating the knotting.
Be cautious not to cut too deep into the flesh and sever a blood vessel, which would cause bleeding. After cutting, rinse the area with rose water or vinegar and cold water. Then place a cotton thread under the tongue that the patient holds every night.
In order to prevent it from healing again and causing bleeding, place a powder on the spot. If blood predominates, use an occlusive paste made specifically for this purpose with a tool suitable for application. Then he treated him with all forms of treatment until he recovered.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In removing the everted (or inverted) toad under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small toad may occur under the tongue, preventing its natural function. It might even grow so large as to fill the mouth, and the procedure for dealing with this involves opening the patient's mouth towards the sun and observing the tumor.
If you see it as red or black, hard, and without any sensation for the patient, do not expose him to it; this is a cancer. If it appears yellowish with moisture, apply sulfur on it and cut it using a gentle scalpel, making sure to remove it from all sides.
If bleeding occurs during your work, place a powdered plaster on it until the bleeding stops. Resume your work until you have finished completely, then rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat him/her with all appropriate treatments until recovery occurs.
The thirty-sixth chapter.
In treating tumors of the breasts.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors may present glands inside the throat that resemble those found outside, known as breasts. If treated with what was mentioned in this section, if they do not heal...
Inspect it: if the tumor is hard and of a reddish color with little sensation, do not expose it to iron as it might cause bleeding. If it's red in color with an intense texture, also avoid exposing it to iron for fear of causing bleeding. Leave it until it matures; either it will soften or explode internally.
And if it is white in color and long, with its origin being thin, then this should be cut. In working on such a case, one should observe before the operation if it has settled and whether there is total dormancy from heat or a partial absence of dormancy.
And then, let the patient sit with his feet towards the sun and his head on a stone. Open his mouth and take an assistant in your hands; you will push down his tongue using this instrument which is like what I describe:
It is made of silver or brass, being as thin as a knife. When you push it down with this tool, the tumor will become visible to you and under your eye. Take an awl and insert it in the socket, then pull it out without pulling anything from the canals.
Then cut it with an instrument similar to scissors, but both of its ends are bent. Each end has a sharp and pointed blade like the other, made from Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If you do not have this instrument, then cut it with pincers like these:
It has one sharp side and the other is not sharp. After cutting one socket, you cut the other in exactly the same way. Then after the cutting, immerse the patient's feet in cold water or salted water.
If he experiences bleeding, immerse him in water that has been boiled with almond shells or asafetida leaves or similar substances until the bleeding stops. Then treat him until he recovers. New swellings may appear elsewhere on his body other than the sockets; cut them in the same way you would cut the sockets.
A woman was treated for a growth that had formed inside her throat, touching the epiglottis and impairing her sense of touch. The growth was about to obstruct her throat, making it difficult for her to breathe. This also prevented her from eating or drinking water.
If it had remained for a day or two, with the tumor having grown twigs until they protruded through her nostrils, I would have proceeded quickly. Then, I pierced one of them with an awl and pulled it out by its root.
Then, I cut it where she realized from the nostril hole, and then did the same for what protruded from the other nostril hole. Then, I opened her mouth and pinched her tongue, after that, I pierced the awl in the very tumor, and then cut off some of it; only a small trickle of blood was left from it.
The woman's hair fell out, and she drank from that hour onwards. Then she ate food; we kept cutting from that tumor again and again for a long time. The tumor would be replaced by something instead of what was cut, until it became a tedious matter to both of us and her.
I opened and cut the tumor inside her throat in a procedure that stopped its increase. Then, I traveled in another direction, and I did not know what God would do to me afterwards.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the removal of a tumor from the uterus.
The one that is called Foeniculum when a descent has occurred to the uterus and it swells, being white and rectangular. If this is firm at the bottom and oblong, it is also referred to as 'Foeniculum'. When treated with what we have described previously in the section on treatment, if the treatment does not yield results.
I saw the hot tumor had subsided from her, and it was delicate, so it should be cut. There wasn't a mass gathered together in her that was elongated and didn't have length; it was soft or of the same color for a period of time or black; it lacked sensation. So, she should avoid cutting it.
In it are intricacies for the anaesthetist. If you see its characteristics, such as its whiteness and length, that one should place the anaesthetist under the sun's light and apply his tongue with the device described then pierce the pin in the unguessed.
And draw it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in cutting the two pistils; you should not cut more than the natural process for fear that if you cut more, you will harm speech and language.
Then, after cutting, use what we described in cutting the pistils and treat it until it recovers. If buttering the anaesthetist on cutting her, she should employ the trick in its use without fear or caution; its purpose is poison; that is, you should place the head of the anaesthetist on your stone.
Then, apply his tongue with the instrument we mentioned. Then take the hot water that was mentioned in the section on kneading and mix it with an uncooled grinding stone; make sure not to let the mixture be too thick or too thin. Fill this device with it and here is its appearance:.
Its tip, where you place the medicine, has a kneading similar to that of a spoonful's kneading. Place the device with the medicine on his tongue itself and let the anaesthetist lie on one side so that saliva can flow from inside his throat instead of descending into it which could harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine as you press it against the tongue for half an hour until she turns dark and calms from the sting of the medicine. If you wish, take a cotton thread, twist it at its end, and dip the cotton into the medicine.
The insertion of cotton threads into a tube from above until the cotton sticks to the bladder. She does this repeatedly until she reaches her desired length for the operation, then leaves it. It becomes loose and shrinks after three or four days, if you need to repeat the treatment, do so.
After the operation, she rubs cotton that has been soaked in oil around the bladder and removes any remaining medicine from around it with this. Then, she rinses with cold water and treats both inside and outside using a catheter until it is healed. This method of treatment is safer than surgery and less frightening.
The bladder can also be treated with gentler methods than surgery. If you want to treat it with incense, do so on this condition: one takes fennel, coriander, rue, wormwood and all similar herbs from the plants. He gathers them completely or in parts, puts them in a pot and immerses them in vinegar.
You heat it until the pot reaches the wisdom's bottom. In the center of the lid, make a hole and place the dehydrator apparatus on this condition: it should be made of silver or copper.
The tip with the incense is inserted into the urethra's mouth until the steam rises in the tube and then escapes from the bladder, making it swell beautifully. Then she repeats this treatment several times until it shrinks; do not prepare this treatment at the first occurrence of a tumor.
It often increases the tumor, so it should be done when her hot tumor is diminishing. If this apparatus isn't available to you, take a tube and attach an eggshell to its end to prevent burning of the urethra.
Because the eggshell prevents steam from burning the mouth and this is a good remedy with its safety,
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the removal of splinters and what erupts in the throat other than that.
Frequently, bones or fish hooks or other things may erupt in the throat. It is necessary to remove what appears clearly visible upon the tongue after licking with a device at noon light.
To show you what is in the throat, and what has not been visible to you and hidden in the throat, it is necessary to purge (the patient) before its food digests in their stomach. Perhaps the erupted thing may come out with vomiting or the patient might swallow a piece of meat or have a roughness in their mouth.
Or, she may swallow a piece of dry bread or take a soft piece from the sea sponge and tie it with a string then swallows it. If the sponge reaches to where the splinter is, quickly pull the string. Do this several times.
Indeed, the splinter or bone often sticks in it and is removed. If it does not come out as we have mentioned, otherwise, use a lead instrument like this:
It should be slightly thicker than the plunger. At its tip, there is a nozzle that allows for easy insertion of food into his/her throat when being eaten gently with their head raised upwards. The physician must take care not to touch their throat causing them to cough and push either the bone or splinter back in, or else they can insert it using their hand.
Inserting the sponge into his/her mouth helps them to identify where the protruding thing is and either pushes it down or pulls on the device upwards, all according to how they are able until it comes out.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the removal of pus in the throat.
If the treatment of the ulcer with what we have mentioned in this chapter, which is medication therapy, does not work, then look at the back of the patient's throat after he has been squeezed by the instrument described to you.
If you see the ulcer, draw it in with a small hook or a gentle and tight gag. If this does not work, take a bent tube and insert it into the back of the patient's throat near the ulcer, then place a red-hot rod inside the tube.
You do this several times and the patient abstains from water for his whole day. Then, he takes a glass filled with cold water which is opened in his mouth to gargle with; he does not swallow any of it, moving the water around occasionally with his hand.
If the ulcer falls into place where she feels water, if it does not come out as described, then fumigate the throat with urine and with vinegar by means of the instrument that was described in incense for God. Do this several times; it will fall down.
The purpose of the fumigation is to take an amount in which you've put a fever sweat by fire, and this amount has a cover in its center with a hole. You then mount one end of the device in that hole. Then pour out the fumigation and place the patient at the other end of the tube, closing their mouth so that they do not let the fumigation escape until they know that it has reached their throat.
If the ulcer falls into place, if it does not fall and otherwise a fumigation is repeated several times and the patient abstains from thirst and eats salt and garlic but does not drink water, then this operation must come out by these means. This is an image of an instrument that attracts the ulcer in the throat when it falls on it with sight.
This passage resembles the tonsils as you see, except that it has this pallor which enters the throat and its ends resemble the beak of a bird in it where if one grazes something on it, it leaves nothing behind.
Another device is used by the tongue, it's a broad iron ring that fits into the mouth up to where the tongue ends. It enters the mouth standing on one of its sides, thus making the mouth open involuntarily and no one can remove it except when it slides off naturally.
The description of the device that opens the mouth with this exact measurement is as follows.
Chapter Forty.
He makes use of speech in the soft parts of tumors and cuts them.
Tumors come in various types, each with its own distinct characteristics as will be detailed one by one in this book. They differ in their softness and texture due to two aspects: the first is related to the nature of the tumor itself and what it contains from moisture.
The second aspect is due to where they occur in the body, as a tumor that develops in the head differs from one that occurs in the abdomen, and a tumor that arises in the flesh differs from one that appears in a joint for each of them has its own mode of treatment.
Among tumors, some should not be punctured until the pus inside has matured and reached its fullness. Others should be punctured when necessary; this means that the pus has not fully formed yet, like those tumors that are close to joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and extends its condition until it infects the surroundings, it might spoil the ligaments or nerves of that joint. This could become an obstacle to the function of that member or make the tumor close to an important body part.
Because if you defer the bursting of pus until it matures, this harms the main organ or makes it near to the cavity and so causes it to burst normally but not completely matured which is near the cavity in order for it not to escape through the cavity's opening becoming internal and thus becomes a necrotic wound.
It remains to some extent not healing, and you should know the time when pus is ready for bursting which happens upon the cessation of pain in the lump, disappearance of fever, decrease of redness, absence of pulse in the affected area, depression at the top of the lump and other signs.
It is necessary that you anticipate the bursting at a point below from the site of the lump if possible, as this makes it easier for pus to flow downwards or to the lowest part and most concentrated area of the lump. The discharge should be in the length of the body if the lumps are located in the limbs like hands and legs.
Sites of muscles, tendons, nerves, arteries and any flat areas without curvature, in short, all flat positions that do not bend. But for those that are curved, the discharge should go according to that position. And if the lump is at fatty tissues, it's better to let out the pus there.
Until its maturation is complete as we described, if you burst it before that, pus will flow out for a long time and it may be very dirty. It might even harden its edges or make the cavity larger, some lumps can burst on the body's width when necessary or according to what the organ needs.
It is necessary to use a single puncture for small lumps and multiple, wide or many slits for large ones according to the size of the lump. Some lumps may require skin excision and cutting if they have become like scars.
In some cases, death occurs like what is displayed in many of the ulcers and hiding places, from which there is a three-cornered groove cut out, and from which it cuts off as the shape of an ace's card like the palm of the Arab.
And there are cases where circular cuts and crescent-shaped cuts, and similar grooves are used, and where there is no protruding head like a flattened, broad tumor; it should be squeezed gently. It is necessary if the tumor is large having gathered for a long time and being hardened that all pus should come out at that time.
But remove some of it, then pull on the tumor to another day and also extract some pus. Do this repeatedly progressively until all of it is removed.
And especially if the patient is weak or pregnant, a child, an old man, if there is much vital energy that dissolves with the pus, it might be that the patient dies without you noticing, so be very careful about this matter.
After squeezing these tumors, you should clean the wound and examine it; if the wound is small or if there was a simple incision, use cotton wool or old cotton. If the tumor is large and has many grooves from squeezing, then follow suit.
It is necessary to insert a thread in each incision so that some of them come together, and if the tumor has cut into the skin or shrunk, it should be stuffed with old cotton or dry cotton wool and pulled tight until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with what is necessary of ointments until healing occurs. If bleeding appears while you are working, use cold water and lemon juice after drinking a cotton thread soaked in them, and hold it on the bleeding spot repeatedly.
If bleeding continues, then it is necessary to use the intervention and treatment and the means that we described in many places in this book and its division. If you are in winter time and the site of the tumor has many nerves, it would be good to warm the channels with a drink and hot oil.
And place it on the site, if you are in summer and the locations are fatty, then the channels should carry a drink mixed with water and oil or a drink of oil all cold until the third day as we said, and the tumor should be removed and wiped.
And use what is similar for its treatment until it heals, this is what you need to know about treating tumors in general. As for the detailed procedure, I have explained each tumor and how to proceed with its treatment step by step.
The forty-first chapter.
In the section about tumors that appear on the scalp.
Tumors appear on the scalp, they are small and belong to a category of goods that it has, which is known as fowl's comb having certain characteristics like chicken combs and various types. Some of them are greasy while others contain moisture resembling pus.
And there are some that contain moisture resembling broth and stew and such, as well as those that are stony and hard. All of them pose no danger in cutting or removing them as long as you don't come across a blood vessel when cutting it.
And when it comes to cutting them, you should first incise or penetrate it with the tool that appears after this instruction which is called the needle, until you understand what it contains. If what it contains is moisture, then cut it lengthwise in a simple cut like this:.
Start by making a cut from line ~b~ to line ~g~, then when the moisture has drained away, remove the sac that contained this moisture and cut it completely without leaving anything at all. Often if something is left behind, it returns again.
Then immerse cotton in the purged grease if it's available, or in salt water and fill the wound with it, leaving it until another day. It eats away whatever is left of the sac. Then re-soak the cotton with the mixture twice and three times if necessary.
Until you are sure that nothing is left of the sac, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the tumor contains a fatty substance, make cuts in this manner:.
Make the cut deep and insert the probes into both sides of the wound, then remove it from every side. Use your best effort to extract the pus that contains it. If a blood vessel obstructs you, do as described after this, similarly if the tumor is constricted by the cut.
The treatment is as previously mentioned, and making a cut in the constricted tumor is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some tumors found in people's heads may not be moist at all for some of them because I made cuts on these tumors.
The head of an elderly woman, I found the tumor as hard as a white chalky stone, it could not be broken even if one were to throw it at it. Not all tumors occurring in the head are like this; they differ from those typically seen on children's heads.
And when it comes to the ears, make cuts in all of them with a simple cut and make its bottom end from below so that material flows down easily. Then treat it according to what suits the treatment.
Chapter forty-two.
In the incision on pigs that are displayed with many markings, these tumors often appear around the neck and under the elbows, as well as in the armpits. They can also be found throughout the body. It is possible for one of them to appear around the neck while there might be many others, and some may generate from others.
Every pig from this group has its own specific gland inside, similar to those found in other animals and on the head as we described. There are many types of pigs among them; some have calcifications, others contain pus, and there are also poisonous ones that do not respond to treatment.
Among them, I saw some that were in good condition under touch; their appearance was nearly the same as skin color and they could move in every direction. They were not attached to the neck nerve, lymph node or artery, nor did they have an ulcer. It is necessary to make a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this manner, from line ~a~ to line ~b~:.
And remove it from every side, and expand the skin with a knife or two blades or many if necessary as we explained for head tumors. Take it out little by little and leave it on the neck without cutting sweat glands or nerves. The pliers should not be very sharp.
So that your hand doesn't increase in cutting or worries the patient, cut only what you need. If you cut sweat glands or arteries and obstructed your work, place a poultice or some of those things that stop bleeding into the wound.
Tighten the wound and leave it until the tumor's pain subsides and the wound calms down, preparing for healing. When bleeding stops at that point, return to your work until finished, then use your dominant finger to search if there is more to remove, then remove and clean other small pigs if they exist.
If there is abundant fat at the root of the pig, it should not be cut from its root. Instead, it should be tied with a thick double thread and left to fall out naturally without causing harm, then it should be filled with dried cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then it should be treated accordingly.
If the pig is cut entirely, it should be that you gather together the edges of the wound and stitch it from inside after determining there is no residue from the fat. If I find that a residue of the pig's bone has remained, then.
It would be necessary to refer to cutting off its root and spine, and use sewing and what we have mentioned. If the pigs contain moisture, they should be covered lightly with a simple plaster where you can see the place of their ripening, make the plaster as close to the bottom as possible as we explained.
Then, after the plaster dries, you apply Egyptian ointment or similar to eat any remaining decay until you see that the wound has cleaned. Then you treat it with herbal ointments for meat until it heals.
The forty-first chapter.
In the case of a growth in the throat, which occurs within the neck.
I mentioned this division in the throat, and I have not seen anyone do it in our country; this is how they speak. But as for those suffering from angina, they should avoid making a cut in the throat because they don't benefit from it.
In order for all the nerves and lung to be permeable, while those who have a hot growth in the mouth or throat or tonsils if the cause is not within the ducts it is necessary to use a cut in the throat to escape from the discomfort caused by suffocation.
If we wish to do so, it is necessary that we cut the throat through three circles of the trachea or make four small cuts longitudinally between two circles to the extent that the cut is in the membrane and not in the cartilage. This position corresponds with the cut.
Since it lacks muscle and the blood vessels are far from it, if the surgeon is bold, he should spread the neck skin with a spatula. Then he must cut the skin until it reaches the trachea next to the blood vessels as soon as he sees any of them.
Then, he cuts the trachea as we described, and uses the coughing up of phlegm that comes out with it, along with any interruption in voice, to determine where to cut the windpipe. The wound remains open for a while. Once the time has passed when he feared choking, his lips are joined together by his skin.
His plan involves only the cartilage and then they use medicines for wound healing until it heals. He, who wrote this book, explains this sentence of our account as follows: when they see that the patient has closed their throat with one of these tumors they mentioned.
The patient with cancer nears death, fearing his breath will be cut off; they go to make a slit in the throat so that the patient can breathe on top of the wound some air and survive the death. They were commanded to leave the wound open until the stages of illness pass and its course is three days or about this amount.
Then, they were commanded to stitch the wound and treat it until it heals. The one who saw this himself said that a servant took a knife and sent him to cut her throat; he cut some of the trachea with it. She was called for treatment, and when I found her, she was screaming like a slaughtered animal. They exposed the wound.
I found that the blood coming out of the wound was little, so I realized that she had not severed the artery or the vein. The air was exiting through the wound causing her discomfort; upon realization, I cleaned and treated the wound until she recovered, and there was nothing for the servant to do except hum in sound, no more than that.
She recovered after several days to her best condition, from which we can say that the larynx incision is not dangerous.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the cut on the tumor that presents from outside in the bicorn, and is called the bicorn's horn.
This tumor, which is called the bicorn horn, is a large tumor in color of the body and it is common in women and it has two types.
It can either be naturally occurring or as an incidental finding. If it is natural, there's nothing to do about it. However, if it occurs incidentally, it has two forms: one resembles fatty lumps and the other resembles a tumor that results from arterial conglomeration, with its cut being dangerous. It should not be subjected to iron piercing except for what is small from it; if you probe and examine it with the probe, its consistency resembles fatty lumps and is not attached to anything in the veins. Therefore, it can be cut as one would cut fatty lumps. Remove it if it's contained in a sac, and if not, remove everything then treat the area with what is appropriate for treatment.
The fifty-fourth chapter.
In the cut regarding types of fatty lumps.
The types of pus are numerous and I have mentioned all their types in the division. It is necessary that we clarify here the difference between pus and discharge, which is problematic; thus, I say that discharge has fever, inflammation and frightening pains until the favor becomes calm. The pus then finishes its process; at that point, the fever and intensity settle down, and the slurry does not have any heat or fever nor pains with it. It contains a specific bag which is characteristic of it and has the color of the body. Its beginning is like mustard seed and it turns into a boil, being bigger on one side and smaller on another.
They are divided into two types, either being fatty or containing moisture. As various colors of moisture were mentioned in the division, it is necessary when treating slurry to puncture and examine it first with a tool called a probe as its image will be presented in the next section following this one.
Measure the size of the tumor, then insert the probe and look at what comes out. If watery moisture comes out regardless of its color, make a simple incision on it as explained in descriptions of other tumors. If no watery substance comes out following the probing, know that it is fatty.
Make a hard incision on it as shown in this image, which I have taught you. Attach it with forceps and gently remove the skin from every side and take care to extract it properly along with the pus if possible.
If the pus bag is punctured during the operation but it could not be extracted properly, this often causes complications. Therefore, remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. If any remains, no matter how much or little, the pus may recur with increased severity.
If you are bleeding and there is only a little left, when you stop bleeding apply hot penetrating ointment on the wound for a while and then treat it with all forms of treatment until it heals. If the injury is large draw a line down each side of its edges and treat it so as to promote healing.
If you encounter a harmful or non-harmful stream that causes bleeding, act immediately by applying the powdered medicine to the wound and leave it bound for two or three days until the wound heals and stops bleeding. Then proceed with what is left of the treatment.

It is suitable for examining tumors, wounds, bones and the like within cavities and secret places. A polished smooth spindle made of Chinese or Spanish brass, or brass or iron, or silver works best.
You can also make scalpels from black lead, and they are suitable for inserting nails that have a guard to turn their bluntness. Nevertheless, there are three types of them; one is long, another is medium-length, and the last one is short.
The thickness of the guard hole for each nail is determined according to its size and narrowness, a picture of a large lead scalpel:.

Its blades are limited, whereas the rest of it is unlimited. This design was made so that it can be used for removing goods when there's fear of cutting a nerve or a nerve fiber, and it provides some relief from the burning sensation one feels during tumor removal.
And these are the scalpels traps, they come in three types; some big ones, others medium-sized, and some small ones. A picture of a large scalpels trap:.
It is made of a brass instrument that gets twisted, and in one end, it resembles a wide spoon. There's a hidden forceps blade in its head that looks like a bird's tongue; you can move it inside and outside as desired when you like, just as you see.

Pictures of the clamps used to stop bleeding, which are three types for both large and small sizes. Picture of the large clamp:.
These clamps are made of copper or a wheel-like porcelain that is slightly longer than the length you see and should be thin. It is necessary to have these types of clamps with you, both large and small, so you can quickly cut off blood flow when necessary and in case medicine is not at hand.
However, do not use these for bloodletting in every part of the body. They should be used on muscular locations such as the leg muscles, thigh muscles, arm muscles, breast, stomach and lower abdomen, and other wet muscular organs.
Other small tools can be made from them, resembling almond shells as shown in this picture:.
It is used to stop bleeding if there is a bleed from the amputation site, or when cutting off sweat or blood vessel. It can be made into a wheel like this:.
Chapter Seventy-Four
In the gland of men's breast.
The one that resembles women's breasts, some men's nipples may swell up to resemble women's until they remain hardened and smelly. If one dislikes this, it would be advisable to make a cut on the nipple in the shape of a crescent like this:
From line ~b~ to line ~g~:. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with ointment for bone healing. Then stitch both edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. If the breast spreads downwards and relaxes due to its size as it appears in women.
You should cut in its upper sides with two cuts resembling a semi-circular shape. Each one of them will connect to the other at their ends, so that the larger line encompasses the smaller one on this image:. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then remove the skin which is in between the two cuts, and remove all the fat. Use the stitches and sutures we have mentioned, along with anything else that needs to be used for treatment until it heals.
If it's not able to absorb the cuts that should be made, you may make more if necessary because of anxiety or due to bleeding. You should stuff the wound with cotton soaked in triple antiseptic and leave it until the remaining fat is consumed. Then treat it until it heals.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the region of the lumps that appear below the elbow.
These lumps that appear below the elbow are of pig nature, containing a bag. Among them, some contain moisture. If any of them contains moisture, it should be cut with a semi-circular incision like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~g~, if you have drained all the contents of the tumor over time, stuff it with old cotton and leave it until another day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of pig knot type, cut it as we mentioned in the cut for pigs; whether its wound extends to the pus discharge then use the same method described previously in treating such cases, when you find that the wound has reached the pus.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the cut of the tumor that appears before the artery or vein, it is called aneurisma.
If the artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, it often exposes a tumor. Similarly, veins can also expose swellings or tumors.
The signs by which one recognizes whether the tumor or swelling is caused by an artery or a vein are as follows: If the tumor originates from the artery, it appears rectangular and gathered in depth within the body. And if you push on the tumor with your finger, you feel that there is a hollow inside, like having something hollowed out.
The tumor that originates from the vein lies flat on the surface of the body, and the cut on these tumors is dangerous, especially in the elbow, axilla, neck, and many other parts of the body. They are really large, so it's advisable to avoid treating them with iron.
As for those that occur in the limbs or head, it's advisable to avoid them. If they are swellings of the artery, make a cut along the length on the skin then open this cut in slits, then slit the artery and remove the clots from it.
Until it is revealed, then insert a needle and extend it to the other side, then tighten the artery with two stitches at the points you identified in threading the arteries which are found in the biceps. Then squeeze out this position using pliers between the ligaments until all blood has been drained from it.
The tumor then dissolves, and treatment that produces pus is applied until the ligaments fall. Then it is treated with ointments suitable for this, so it may heal.
If the tumor is before a cut of a vein, it should be necessary to grasp as much of the tumor with your skin hand then insert a needle below the place you are holding with your hand and pierce it. In her there should be twined thread until she exits from the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly with a good knot as you were told to do in tying grapes from both sides by each end of the thread, if you fear that the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread underneath the entire tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
Tighten the threads in four places, then cut the tumor in its middle until what's inside comes out. Cut off any excess skin and leave what was tied. Then put on a dressing that you have soaked in wine and oil. Then use the treatment consisting of ointments and applications until it heals.
The fiftieth chapter.
In the tumor that appears due to nerve irritation.
Just as a tumor may appear due to irritation in the artery or vein, so too can it appear from nerve irritation if there is a blow or excessive fatigue, or something similar. It's more common in areas where nerves are abundant or concentrated.
In every location where joints move, this fleshy tumor resembles the color of the rest of the body and is usually painless. When it's pressed hard, one feels a sensation similar to numbness within. The tumor isn't solidly embedded deep in the body.
Instead, it's under the skin and moves in all directions without going forward or backward. Any part of it that's found near joints should not be treated with iron because it might cause damage. Parts of it found on the head or forehead are different.
Slicing the skin with dividers, if the tumor is small, grasp it with a scalpel and cut it from the root. If it's large, stitch it with a thong and scrape it off, then remove it and sew up the wound using stitches until it heals.
The fifty-first chapter.
In the case of removing the fatty tissues that appear in the abdomen.
Many people have experienced fatty tissues, referred to as mycosis, appearing in their abdomens and other parts of their bodies. Their origin is soft while their heads are firm. They may have thinned edges and vary from small to extremely large.
I have seen a man with two masses in his abdomen that resemble mushrooms. Their origin is almost white and thin, they've thickened at their edges and are always dripping moisture. I removed them; one weighed around 12 ounces, the other around 6.
The process of cutting it involves observation; if the fatty tissue is wet and the mass itself appears white, soft and thin when moist, you should cut it with a wide divider. Have its edge touched by fire for your metal tool often lets out much blood during the process.
If the blood flow is overwhelming, stop it. If you see that the mass is hard and scared by iron cutting, take a firm lead thread, tie the mass according to its nature, leave it for two days then add pressure on the lead thread; you will continue to apply pressure.
Keep cutting the mass until it falls apart on its own without any effort. If the mass is thick, some anxiety and confusion can be expected, especially if it's in the abdomen. However, it might just be possible to cut half of it or part of it.
Then reinforcement so that it doesn't recur, followed by treatment until the wound heals, and be cautious not to expose yourself to cuts that look like a thin line with little sensitivity. These are benign tumors, and I will discuss cancer later on.
The second and fiftieth chapter.
In treating the hernia.
The hernia can be caused by many factors, either due to the rupture of the abdominal diaphragm which causes the protrusion of the intestine or contents from other bodily cavities, or due to bleeding that emerges from a vein or artery as previously discussed, or it could be due to wind getting stuck in there.
If it's due to the rupture of the abdominal diaphragm and the protrusion, then the color of the tumor resembles that of the body, and it is soft without pain and appears in various positions. And if it's due to the protrusion of the contents, its position differs more from what we described. If you press on it with your fingers, it disappears then comes back again. It might have a lump and increase significantly when one goes to the bathroom or experiences severe fatigue. If it's due to moisture, then it would be soft.
It doesn't disappear if you press it with your hand, neither does it increase nor decrease. If it's due to blood, this tumor appears blackened given these signs. If it's due to a growing flesh, the tumor would be hard and firm, remaining stationary at one point.
If it's due to wind, then it feels soft when touched. In working with this, you should observe: if the hernia is caused by blood from a vein or artery or wind, you should refrain from treating it as it may involve fear and deception as I informed you in the chapter that mentioned tumors arising from veins and arteries.
If the disease is located in the throat before the food or phlegm, it should be ordered that the patient stand up, standing fully extended, then to learn with the needle around the whole soreness. Then command him to lie between your hands on his back. Then use a wide scissor around the soreness in the place you taught with the needle, then extend the middle of the lump upwards with a large clamp. Then tie the place of the cut with strong thread or silk ribbon tightly.
And the knot of the belt should be elastic. Then open the middle part of the constricted lump above the belt, and put in your index finger; if you find that the pus has been drawn out by the belt, relax the elasticity and push the pus back into the abdomen. If a boil is found, extend it with a clamp.
And cut off the lymph nodes, if a vein or artery obstructs you, hold it firmly and continue your work. Take two needles and insert two strong threads into them. Enter these needles into the lump that you made around the tumor as they are hard to penetrate, then tighten the tumor in four places with the needle.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the constricted flesh dries up and falls off by itself or cut it when it becomes soft and dried. Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments until it heals, if the disease is in a fatty part of the meat inside it.
Or if it is due to moisture, you should cut the lump as we said and remove the blood or moisture that you find there, then treat it with what promotes healing of the area.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
In the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in this section the types of cancer and how they can be treated with medicines, warning against treating them with iron as it might lead to rust. We also discussed cancer that originates in the womb and warned about its treatment.
I mentioned at the beginning that when cancer is located in a place where it can be completely excised, like breast or leg cancers, and for organs capable of being removed as a whole, especially if it's small when it starts. However, it should not be approached when it's large.
If I had been able to heal anyone of it or seen someone like me before, who reached this point, the work would progress if it's possible as we mentioned earlier, easing the situation from the blackness once and then separating if it has clear filling in the veins.
Then the pus is established in a position where it can benefit from working, then open the pipes suitable for it within the cancer. Then, cut from all sides with the skin until nothing remains of its roots and let the blood flow without cutting it abruptly.
But squeeze the places and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever you can from machines. If it obstructs you during work, a massive bleeding occurs from cutting an artery or vein; puncture the veins until the blood stops then treat it with all treatments till he recovers.
Chapter Forty-Five.
In the treatment of scabies.
We were informed in the section about types of irrigation and how water comes together, and the signs for each type and their treatment with medicines. The one that is treated with iron is only the tubercular type, not to be approached with iron in either the phlegmatic or fleshly types.
If the method of treatment has failed, and you have treated this type of hard, resistant cancer with medicine without success, observe whether the patient's weakness has become excessive or if he has another disease besides cancer such as being.
Or diarrhea, and so on; if this is the case, treat it with iron as it acts as a purgative. If you see that the patient has abundant strength without any other disease besides cancer, and he is neither a child nor an elderly person, then your treatment should involve making him stand between your hands. And behind the patient, serve him by squeezing his stomach with your hands and pushing the water down to the elbow area. Then take a back scratcher in this posture:.
Limit the movements of both hands for a long time, define the direction as in the back scratcher, except that there is some fluff in it slightly to avoid causing harm when working towards the intestines and injuring him. Then retract if you notice that cancer originated from the intestinal area.
You should push the cut from her pubic region three fingers downwards towards her elbow, if cancer is caused by liver disease. Let your cut for the liver be from the pubic area to three fingers, and if it's due to gallbladder disease, let your cut be on the right side with three fingers.
Also, the cut should not be on the side that the patient wants to lie on, lest urine leaks to this weak area. Then pierce all the skin with the instrument, then insert the instrument into this cut and raise your hand.
Use the back scratcher between the skin and the scrotum as if you are scraping it, and the amount you scrape should be like a fingernail or slightly more. Then pierce the scrotum until the back scratcher reaches a hollow area which is where the water is located, then remove it and enter the instrument into this hole as shown.
This is a semi-bow-shaped tube made from silver, or copper, or smooth brass. It has a small hole at the bottom and two holes on each side, one hole near each other and another hole on the other side, as you can see.
And it might place its end like the nib of a pen in this image:.
If it has a ring at the top, then when the machine reaches the water, it releases its load of water in an average amount of time. For if you remove more water than necessary during this time, it could potentially cause death due to the release of the animal's soul.
Or it might show him a flog that is close to causing death, but remove from it according to its strength and what the sick person's condition suggests based on their pulse strength and the quality of their color. Then, release the machine and stop water. This is because it stops flowing from the pump.
Because of the skin that holds the hole on the scrotum, which I told you to stop on this condition, then repeat the machine another day if I see the sick person capable for it.
Also, also take out the small amount of water from it. Do this for days while you are on your guard against any mistakes until there is only a small amount of water left. If you fear for the patient and leave behind a large quantity of water, cover that with hot sand.
Excessive sweating in the bath and under the sun, followed by allowing thirst to take over, then treating with dried medicines until he recovers. After that, care for the stomach, liver, and gallbladder as described previously after removing water.
The fifty-fifth chapter.
In the treatment of children who are born and their places of urination are not suitable, or if the opening is narrow or in the wrong place.
Some boys may come out of their mother's womb and vagina without being descended, it should be necessary to puncture his opening immediately after birth.
The castrator is very delicate on this image:.
Then place a very thin, leaden pin in the opening and secure it. Keep it for three or four days. When the child wants to urinate, push him back, then pull him again. If you lose the lead, the urine may not be able to reach its place and will get blocked.
And as for those whose opening is narrow, treat them with lead as we said, for many days until it widens. And among those whose opening is in the wrong place; this refers to some of those who are born and have an opening at the end of their penis that they can't urinate forward.
Until it raises the scrotum with his hand above, and does not beget before birth because the semen can't reach the womb in a straight line; this is extremely disgusting reason. The purpose of working on this issue is that he should lie down on his back for the urine carrier.
Then extend her vagina with your left hand strongly, and shave or cauterize the scrotum head with a large sharp razor or penknife as if you were carving something to make its center slightly resemble a penis so that the opening should be in the middle as it should.
And when you perform your work, be cautious of excessive bleeding, for it often requires dealing with it by cutting the blood and treating the wound until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-One.
In the urine that is displayed in the bladder, kidney, and gallbladder, leading to impurity and decay, causing the bladder to stick to the kidney.
This urine often occurs in the appendix, which is an inflamed part of the stomach wall. It can be either bad-smelling or not, but if it's not bad smelling, it should be attached to a soft string for treatment.
Cut it all the way through, then hang it with cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment. After that, treat it with the goat's milk ointment until it heals. If the urine is foul smelling and dark, it should be treated with kheyf after cutting and cleaning it.
If the urine is in an oily bladder and does not mix, with some inside the bladder and some outside, it should remove the urine that's inside first until it disappears, then treat from the outside.
Because if you treat them both together, the bladder might rupture. It can also appear in women and in the bladder as darkness and decay, it should be that all that has darkened or is likely to spoil or has spoiled.
Then, apply on it afterwards honey mixed with the grated and roasted peel of myrtle leaves and karnissa. Then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If there's any bleeding, use kheyf in a half-moon shape like this:
Kheyf is beneficial for both situations, meaning bleeding of blood and wounds if they decay. If the kidney has solidified and left completely at some point in time, it should be inserted into the passage of the male with a lead pipe to pour it onto the urine area. And as for the bladder sticking to the kidney.
This attachment only occurs in those with a healthy scrotum who have not undergone circumcision, and it may be exposed to adhesion due to a wound or tumor. It is necessary to remove this adhesion with an oiled scalpel until the ligament dissolves and the testicle can move freely from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them during examination, it may be necessary to remove a little from the scrotum and the sack. This is because the sack is thin and might rupture quickly due to its fragility, then separate the sack from the testicle with a fine piece of cotton thread that has been dipped in cold water so as not to stick together either.
Then he is treated with a vasoconstrictor until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Five.
In purifying boys and treating what they may suffer from mistakes.
Circumcision is not something other than the separation of connection like any surgeries, but since it's done by our will and used specially on boys, there should be a clear distinction in how we perform this operation.
The easiest path leading to safety, I would say, is that what was not mentioned in her writings about circumcision because it was not used in their laws; rather, it's something we have acquired.
Through experimentation, I found that the majority of craftsmen and butchers perform purification according to Moses' method or with a knife. They use thread for tying, and cutting is done with a finger bone; I tried all these methods.
I found no better method than purification with a knife and tying with thread. As for the Moses' way, it often causes the skin to stick due to the two layers of the sack's skin; perhaps I would cut off the top layer but leave the bottom one behind.
He is compelled to perform another amputation, the pain recurs after treatment with cautery, and cleaning by cauterization does not agree with an amputation of the prepuce because it might have entered into its hole. As for cleaning by thorn pricking, there may be skin loss or corruption of your work, or the child's skin is naturally short in length..
Often, they are born without needing cleaning, and I have seen this, and as for cleaning with scissors and bandaging with thread, experience has shown me its advantage because the scissors is proportional to cutting, since the blade above is like the blade below.
When you have touched your hand with proportion to the two blades, cut according to one measurement and in one time, then becomes the length of the thread almost a wall for the prepuce skin from all aspects, no error occurs undoubtedly, and the first purpose is that it seems to the child.
And especially if some of those who understand a little, that you only tie the thread in his prepuce and let him to another day. Then he rejoices and is pleased with all your means for this, what he accepts with his mind, then stop him standing before you at an appropriate height.
And do not let him sit and hide the scissors in your armpit or under your foot, so that his eye does not fall on it nor on anything of the tools. Then enter your hand into his prepuce and inflate the skin and lift it up until the head of the prepuce comes out.
Then cleanse what gathers there from impurity, then tie the indicated site with a doubled thread. Then tie a little below that one with a second banding. Then hold with your index finger and the sponger of the bottom tying tightly, and cut between the bands. Then raise the skin quickly above and remove the head of the amnion, then let some blood flow as it is better and causes less swelling of the amnion. Then wipe it with a wet cloth and sprinkle it with dry burned cinder from the charcoal or cornstarch, this is the best I have tried, or cornstarch itself is also preferable.
Then raise the skin quickly above and remove the head of the amnion, then let some blood flow as it is better and causes less swelling of the amnion. Then wipe it with a wet cloth and sprinkle it with dry burned cinder from the charcoal or cornstarch, this is the best I have tried, or cornstarch itself is also preferable. Then apply above the necessary parts using a chicken egg yolk that has been cooked in rose water and beaten with fragrant, pure rose oil. Leave it on him for another day, then treat him with all other treatments until he recovers.
This is an image of the scissor that is suitable for purification:.
The file should be straight, without any bend, sharpened at the tip, and the length of both blades should equal the length of the handles. As for the error in the act of purification, it may have resulted from completely cutting all or some of the inner skin during the operation, therefore you should extend it with your finger nail before the area swells.
Cut it evenly, if you can't hold it with your nail then attract it with a hook and cut it. If it has passed three days and what remains under the head of the amnion is swollen and puffed up, leave it until the hot swelling subsides and remove it gently.
Cut it according to what is ready for you, keep from the head of the amnion. If you cut a part of the head of the amnion, it will not harm that, treat it with whatever seals wounds among the body parts we described in our article on the body parts.
And if you cut more of the skin than necessary and it tightens above, that also will not harm much. Treat him with what we have mentioned until he recovers.
The fifty-eighth chapter.
In the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to obstruction caused by a stone, clotted blood, mucus or an exudate, and so forth. If this condition is treated with the methods we've discussed, which include the various treatment procedures described within this section, then appropriate remedies will be found.
If the urine does not flow and I have observed that the retention of urine due to a stone has affected the neck of the bladder, then it might be necessary for him to lie on his side. Then one should place someone on his back, extend their belly towards their back, and hold onto him as much as possible.
In that case, the neck of the bladder is forced to push the stone behind. The urine will then be able to flow if it does not do so as described and if things are tough on the patient, then it might be necessary to use the machine called catheters which has this image:.
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth and hollow like a bird's feather quill. It is long as about one yard and half, having a gentle swelling at its head end. There is an attracting nozzle for the urine to take in a bent thread which should be tied at one of its ends with wool or cotton tightly.
One ends the thread inside the catheter and uses a slight incline if some of wool is desired to enter into the tube and seal it like a button. Then, grease the catheter with oil or butter or egg white. The patient sits on a chair.
She moves her thighs and anus with wet furs, oil, or damp water, then enters the catheter into the anus gently until it reaches the beginning of the anus. Then she bends the anus upwards towards the crotch area and pushes the catheter inside it.
Until even if the divider is doubled, then push the catheters inward until close to the seat. The male member inclines downwards in it and the catheters are inside him, then push it until it reaches the bladder. The patient feels that something has reached a void.
And that is done at this level because the passage in which urine flows in it is twisted, then the string of wool is pulled slightly with strength, for the urine follows the wool. Then she removes it and flushes the urine out, and repeats the catheters.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-One.
How to inject the bladder with a catheter.
Illustrations of the devices suitable for this, made from silver or from hollow copper, have a long tube on a cork stopper. They are intended to be used for pouring water and medicines in it, and that device is called a catheter. Here is its illustration:.
They are made of silver or from hollow copper, with a long tube on the cork seal; all of it is hollowed out except for the tip where there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
The hollow part where the pump is placed extends up to as much as it fills without excess. When you pull on it, it sucks in some moisture and when pushed, it moves outwards similarly to how a grease scoop works in naval battles, which is thrown with oil.
If you want to introduce moisture into the bladder, insert one end of the catheter into the moisture and pull up with the pump. The moisture is sucked into the inner space of the catheter, then its tip enters the divider as described in our catheters. Then push the moisture with the pump.
If this moisture reaches the bladder at its resting position until it is felt by the patient, and this is an image caption for a gentle catheter which is used to irrigate the bladder.
It is made of silver or brass, its upper part resembles a small tampon and below it there is a bulb in which the ligature lies. Then take a sheep bladder and place the desired moisture to be injected into the bladder inside it, then tie it tightly between the two chambers with a doubled thread.
That moisture is slightly heated on the fire, then the tip of the catheter is inserted into the urethra. Then you grip the bladder with the moistened part firmly and tightly, until the patient feels that this moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of leather and make it into a circle. Poke holes in all its areas then insert a thin thread like you would turn a wheel. After that, gather the circle as you would assemble a pot after putting inside what you want of moisture, powders, and water.
Then tie it in the device and make it as you made with the bladder from squeezing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
The sixty-first chapter.
In the removal of stones.
We have mentioned in the division the types of stone and their treatment with medicines, we have pointed out the differences between the stones formed in the kidney and those formed in the bladder as well as all their signs. We also mentioned the stone on which hand work is done and splitting.
And it is the stone formed specifically in the bladder, which develops in the urethra, and I describe this with a clear explanation and succinctly.
I say that kidney stones generated in the bladder occur more often among boys, and one of their signs is that urine comes out of the bladder resembling water in its turbidity.
Sand is present in it, and it affects the male organs, causing mischief. It often hangs down then spreads out. In many cases, the pubis becomes prominent with it. Ease of sexual performance among boys decreases until they reach fourteen years old, whereas it becomes more difficult for the elderly. As for young adults, they are between these two extremes.
The one who has larger stones should have easier treatment, while smaller ones are against this rule. If we move to the treatment, it is imperative that a catheterization be performed which discharges all impurities in his bladder, as it may prevent the presence of stones during examination.
Then, the urine is held with his legs being lifted and shaken downwards to push out the stone down to the bladder's neck or remove it from a raised position several times. Afterward, he is seated between your hands while his hands are under his knees to make the bladder fully tilted downwards before examining it.
Then, try to extract it from the outside; if you feel the stone in the space, proceed with piercing it right away. If it doesn't come out under gentle pressure, it should be advisable to rub the dominant finger tip over the oil of your left hand (or middle finger if the urine is that of a boy).
If he is a fully-grown boy, insert his finger into his pubis and search for the stone until it falls under your finger tip. Move it slightly little by little to the bladder's neck, then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the spot where you want to pierce it.
The command the servant that he presses the bladder with his hand, and commands another servant to extend both of their right hands for women above and their other hands to extend the skin beneath the women towards the place where the opening is. Then take the cutter's knife which this is its form:.
And cut between the throne (seat) and the female organs not in the middle but to the side of the left mechanism. The cut should be at the same place as the stone and your finger on the throne when you are pressing it outward. The cut should be wide from outside and narrow from inside, according to what enables the stone's exit.
I will not exaggerate, perhaps when I press the finger in the throne near the cut due to the stone, it may come out without much difficulty. Know that there might be parts of the stone having corners and edges which makes its exit difficult for this reason.
Some are smooth resembling walnut and cylindrical, making their removal easy. If there are parts of them having corners and edges, they make the cut a little bigger. If it doesn't come out like this, then try to adjust by gripping them with tight tweezers whose tip is like that of forceps.
To fix on the stone so it doesn't escape from it, or else enter a fine and pointed device under it. If you can't do it on that, slightly widen the cut. If there is blood overpowering something of you, then cut it with scissors.
If there are more than one, first push the largest into the bladder's mouth then cut it. Then push the smaller one afterwards. Do this similarly if there are more than two. If it is extremely large, it is a mistake to make a large incision on it because it exposes two possibilities:
Either he dies or continuous urine retention will occur for there is no healing of the actual place basically but it tries to push until it gets out, or in case of a fracture by scratching, it will get out in pieces.
If you have finished your work, clean the wound with a dressing and endure the pain of stitches and pins. Tighten them and make an incision over it oiled and drink or smear cold water and oil to cool down the hot inflammation then let the patient lie on his back during urination. Do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Once it dissolves, clean the area with plenty of water and oil. Then treat it with the mastic ointment and basil ointments until it heals. If any new inflammation or hot swelling appears during healing, this indicates that blood may be frozen in the bladder and urine may be prevented. This can be recognized by bleeding out with urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood. If it remains, it indicates decay in the bladder and its infection. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, apply treatment suitable for each type until it heals.
It is necessary during all treatment periods to tie the thighs together and gather them, so that the medicines placed on the area are stabilized. If it's a small stone that has entered the urethra and caused inflammation there, preventing urine from coming out, treat it with what I have described before it reaches the crack.
Often, I have been able to do without this operation as an incision because I tried that method which involves taking a piece of iron from steel; its appearance is like this:.
The tip is triangular with a sharp point and it's gilded in wood, then take a thread to tie the penis under the stone so that it doesn't go back into the bladder. Then enter the nail of the steel piece gently until the steel reaches the same stone.
You control the kidney stone with your hand little by little as you aim to pierce it until it extends from the other side. Then, urine starts flowing out of its reservoir and your hand rests on what is left of the stone outside the penis; then it breaks down and comes out with the urine, cleaning up the discharge.
If this treatment is not suitable for you, there's an obstacle preventing you from doing so; tie a thread under the stone and another above it, then cut through the stone in the same shaft between the ties, and then remove it.
Then, the ligature is removed and the coagulated blood that has formed in the wound is cleansed. The knot under the stone must be tied so that it does not return to the bladder; the other knot above prevents the skin from retracting back when the string is removed after removing the stone, thus covering the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper string, you should lift the skin above so that it reverts upon your emptying and covers the wound as we have explained.
The sixty-first chapter.
In the removal of stones for women.
Very little stones form in women, and if one were to present with a stone, its treatment would be difficult due to many reasons. One being that the woman might have been pregnant, and secondly, it is hard to find a woman willing to expose herself to a doctor.
If she is virginal or of menstruating women, the third being that you cannot find a woman who can handle this craft, especially manual work. And fourthly, the location of the incision on the stone in women differs from its position, requiring a separate incision.
In this matter there is danger, but if necessity demands it, a well-trained female physician should be sought. There are few of them; if not, request a competent male doctor as a companion or prepare a capable woman skilled in female matters, or find someone who can give some indication in this field.
You should prepare her and instruct her to perform all tasks you ask of her, starting with inspecting the stone first. This means she needs to check if the woman is pregnant; it might be necessary for her to insert a finger into her place and inspect the stone. If she finds it and can press it under her finger.
When that happens, you should instruct her to cut her open. If the woman is not pregnant and is a male, then the woman of capability should insert her finger into the vagina of the afflicted person and inspect the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and vigorously squeezing it.
If she finds the stone, it should be directed from the mouth of the bladder downwards to the limit of her strength until she reaches the root of the thigh. Then cut her open in front of half the vagina at the root of the thigh on whichever side she comes across the stone in that area.
And she should not remove her finger, pressing it against the stone. The cut should be small at first, then introduce the probe into this tiny cut. If she feels the stone, she can widen the cut as much as she realizes that the stone will come out of it. Remember that there are many types of stones.
Among them, there are small and large stones, smooth and rough ones. There are long stones that twist around inside like a snake. There are also branched stones. Recognize these types so you can guide your actions accordingly. If the blood flow is predominant, wash the affected area with water, keep it for an hour until the bleeding stops then proceed to your work again.
Until the stone comes out, and prepare for yourself the instruments that you were told about in removing stones from men so you can use them in your work. If it is blood loss that overwhelms you and you learn the heartbeat as if coming from a severed artery, place the clamps on the spot.
Apply the clamps with a firm pull, do not release them and do not attempt to reapply them. Leave the stone inside as further removal might harm the patient. Then treat the wound. Wait for the bleeding to stop after some days and let the site heal before resuming your work until the stone is removed.
The second chapter and sixty.
In the groove of the water channels.
The water channels are a gathering of moisture in the white membrane that is under the skin covering the testicle and close to the egg, known as the scrotum. It may be within a special membrane that nature prepares for it in one side of the egg.
Until he thinks it's another egg and it exists between the skin of the testicle and the white membrane that we have mentioned, but this is not common. This development of water arises due to weakness which affects females making them susceptible to this substance and they may suffer from it as well.
This moisture can have many colors, either yellow like butter or red like blood, or dark brownish-black, or water-like white which is the most common. The signs by which it's identified vary.
Where there is water gathering, if it's in the white membrane as we described, the lump would be slightly elongated to length like an egg shape and the testicles wouldn't be visible since the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If the wetness is in the yolk sac's membrane, then the tumor becomes egg-shaped.
This is why people misinterpret it as another egg. If the wetness is between the scrotum's skin and the white sac, it falls under the sense of touch. However, if you wish to know the color of the wetness, apply the square sponge over the tumor after advancing its picture. Whatever emerges from the sponge dictates what is inside.
If we move to iron treatment, you should order the patient for bleeding if it's possible and see if his body is full. Then, let him lie on his back slightly elevated on something high. Place many perforations under him, then sit on his left side.
You should order a servant to sit on his right side extending his fingers towards one side of the scrotal skin and towards the belly's drainage area. Then, take a broad spatula and cut through the scrotal skin from the middle lengthwise almost up to the thigh.
Make the cut parallel to the line that divides the scrotal skin into two until it reaches the white sac containing the spermatic cord. Cut through this and be careful not to cut too deep. Make your incision more along the side that sticks to the testicle, and remove as much of the excised tissue as you can manage.
Then, loosen the water-filled sac broadly and fully remove all the water. Next, spread both sides of the cut with clamps and release the spermatic cord upwards without touching the testis-containing skin. Cut the spermatic cord as much as you can cut it either in one piece or cut by cut.
Especially the soft side of it, you should cut deeply to prevent water from returning. If the egg comes out of its skin while you're working, stop after removing the spermatic cord and then replace it. Then stitch together both sides of the scrotal skin with stitches.
Then treat him with all other surgical remedies until he recovers. If the egg has been affected by a previous disease, it is necessary to tie the vessels in the scrotum for fear of bleeding. Then cut off the foreskin from the scrotum and remove the egg. After that, treat him as we have mentioned.
If the water has mixed in both sides equally, know that it is two streams. Cut through the other side as you did on the first one regardless of whether your preference would be to have one action done or not. Then wipe away the blood.
And insert wool that has been dipped in oil or rose butter into the cracks. Outside, place another layer of wool that has been dipped in a drink and oil and spread it on the two testicles with abdominal moisture, placing a folded piece of cloth above them; these are the supports. And secure it from above with the band that has six ends as illustrated here:.
Then take two straps, weave them and fill with wool that has been spread out as shown in this example. The ends are made with cotton or wet wool which is tied together in the waistband of the trousers; one end takes on the seat and reaches to the back.
The second one goes towards the elbow, with both ends on the thighs from below and the remaining two ends on the hips. The entire tension is gathered in the trousers' waistband. This band can also be made of string instead of cutting with iron.
This involves taking a soft, small knife and cutting the scrotal skin as described until you reveal the white sack containing water. Then take another tool like this:.
It resembles the Greek eye, then it is sealed with that pouch until all moisture has been removed. Then you will fill the sack with tubes and remove and cut through the layer containing the liquid to do as much as you can without touching the egg with fire.
Know that this surgery is more refined, safer and further removes blood loss compared to cutting operations, it is preferable; whenever you encounter obstruction during the cut or while piercing, hot lump or bleeding or anything else, it should be treated with a treatment suitable for what was mentioned in advance whenever you come across such obstructions.
If the patient is weak and cannot bear this surgery due to its harshness, then he should apply cautery according to what I describe. It's when it matches your situation with the evidence we provided.
The abscess is watery, it should be made for the patient to sit on a high stool. Then cauterize the lump from below using wide pincers and make the cautery along the body, with an open opening so that all water can drain out completely. Place a piece of cotton on the spot and tie it.
Leave him to burn out the rest of the water, then treat it until he heals from his wound. If the water leaks out while cauterizing him, this is because the white membrane gets stuck in the mouth of the wound and prevents water from leaking out.
If that happens, then you should insert an ostrich feather or the tool used to extract water from lovers (a common remedy at the time) which has been shown in illustrations, or slightly increase the opening of the wound.
Know that water may reappear and gather after about six months or so. If it does, cauterize him in the same way and let the weak patient endure his days.
Chapter Thirty-Six
In the incision on fatty abscesses and their treatment.
Know that an incision on this kind of fatty abscess often leads to death, thus we see leaving it alone and avoiding danger while considering the work involved in it and different types of tumors.
I say that many swellings occur in the bodies from which the female organs are made, and this is caused by many reasons either due to an abundance of menstrual discharge directed towards the females or due to a strike. The color of the tumor matches the body's color and it doesn't contain water.
The tumor is jelly-like and perhaps the tumor is colored like blood, it has no sense or feeling. It might be due to complications in veins and their enlargement as mentioned earlier or from enlargement of the lymphs. If it's from the enlargement of the veins, that can be identified by seeing the disappearance of the tumor.
If it sticks when pinched with your fingers and should not be cut open, while if it is from lymphatic enlargement, nothing disappears when pinching with your fingers. This type can possibly penetrate and into other tissues.
This involves making a cut on the scrotum skin, then stretching out the testicle upwards and taking it out of the white sac. Then freeing the ligament from vessels and tying them together. Cutting off the ligament after taking everything from all sides around the testicle, if the testicle has been attached to that reproductive tissue.
It may be necessary to remove the testicle and cut it, if there is an attachment between something from the sacs or among the vessels. In such cases, all this attachment should be freed and cut in a straight line.
If the growth of flesh is in a place of attachment that occurs behind, it may be necessary to cut all of it and then remove the testicle as we have said. Once you've done your work, clean up the wound with wool soaked in butter and wine, then proceed with other treatments until complete healing occurs.
Chapter 46
In treating colic associated with distension.
The dalya is a knot-like tumor, similar to an ovarian cyst. It causes stiffness and difficulty in movement, sport and walking. In treating this condition among the diseases, it's close to what was previously mentioned.
However, it should be noted that the action performed by the predecessors should be followed. I say, it is necessary for the patient to sit on a high chair, then push the female genital organs downwards, and hold the skin of the scrotum with your fingers while touching the vessels which are close to the penis.
And has another attendant hold it, stretching the skin tightly for a long time. Then, cut with a sharp, broad scalpel in a curving incision using the heel of your hand to expose the vessels. Then, scrape off from each side as I previously told you when dissecting the veins in the testicles, and pierce it with a needle threaded with a doubled thread.
And bind it at the first location offered by the dalya and also at its last, then cut it in the middle with a vertical incision along the body length and remove whatever has accumulated there of liquid bad pus.
Then, treat the scrotum with the treatment of other surgical wounds that you wish to generate for a period until it sheds the vessels nourishing one of the ovaries; there is no harm in that. If dalya occurs in all the vessels, it should be desirable to remove one ovary along with the vessels so as not to deprive the egg of its food. By cutting off the vessels, it deflates and is no longer useful,.
The fifty-fourth chapter.
In treating the obstructive eye diseases.
The occurrence of this obstruction is due to a fissure that opens in the eyelid, extending over the abdomen towards the ovaries. The contents of this lump are directed towards one of the breasts.
This lump can either be due to a tear in the tear duct or an extension of it. These two types are among many causes, whether a hit, a strain, crying or lifting something heavy, etc. Its sign is that if it's due to the extension of the tear duct, then it gradually occurs over a long period of time.
It does not occur suddenly; the lump is flat and reaches a certain depth before the tear duct compresses the mucus, and its sign is that if it's due to a tear in the tear duct, then it starts with severe pain immediately and the lump appears distinctly under the skin nearby.
That happens due to the mucus coming out and its destination outside through the tear duct. It may come with a splinter, so this obstructive eye disease is called "mucous and splintery". It could also be accompanied by odor, and it might cause constipation if it stays in the mucus, leading to loss of feces.
Because it causes severe pain and cramps, especially when compressed. The treatment for these kinds of cause can be risky with iron usage, so one should avoid falling into this trap. The method is to instruct the patient to push back mucus inside his body if it tries to return.
Then, he lies down between your hands and raises his legs. Extend the skin near the ovaries upwards, then cut the entire scrotal skin lengthwise. Then insert needles into both sides of the incision in order to widen it as much as necessary.
The incision should be as large as possible for the egg to come out from it, then strip the scrotal sacs under the skin of the testicles until the white hard scrotum is exposed on all sides. Then, when that happens, insert your index finger into what lies beneath the egg.
Between the white scrotum under the skin of the testicle and the second scrotum, a detachment occurs from behind the testicle. Then, using the right hand, fold it into the testicular skin, while doing this, stretch the white scrotum with the left hand above the incision and lift the testicle along with the scrotum to that side.
You command the servant to lift the testicle upwards and completely detach any adhesion behind. Then, with your finger, you search for anything of the contained feces in the hard white scrotum; if you find some, push it downwards into the abdomen.
Then, you take a needle with thick thread that has been unravelled from ten threads and insert it at the end of the scrotal sac located under the testicle skin next to the incision. Then, you cut off the ends of the bent thread until there are four strands left. Then, you arrange them on top of each other in a hard bundle and bind it to the scrotal sac we said is under the testicle skin with a very tight band from both sides. Then, you also wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing can reach anything from among the vessels feeding them. So that no heat issue occurs from it, and also another band is made outside the first band, about half a finger away from it. After these two bands, you leave a part of the scrotal sac under the testicle skin as large as an entire finger.
So that no heat issue occurs from it, and also another band is made outside the first band, about half a finger away from it. After these two bands, you leave a part of the scrotal sac under the testicle skin as large as an entire finger. The remaining is cut completely in a rotation, and the egg comes out with it. Then, there's an incision under the scrotum skin which drains blood and fluid like what we described previously, then the cotton dipped in oil is used to apply on the wound, and the bandage is utilized as described.
And the white tube that we mentioned, if it swells after its careful removal due to excessive bleeding, this happens quite often. The bandage should be left until it falls off by itself. If it falls slowly, heat water can be used to assist in falling and oil is applied on it until it falls off.
Then, the wound is treated with all treatments for wounds until it heals.
The sixty-first chapter.
In this solaris (surgical instrument), I have not seen anyone daring to treat it with iron. The first thing mentioned is that it should be made as we described for the one with Daliani. That means tying the blood vessels after making the incision underneath gently.
Then, make an incision in the middle and treat the tumor with what opens it until the blood vessels fall out. Then treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter seventy-one.
In the hernia that occurs in the abdominal region.
Hernia in the abdominal region, as we mentioned, tends to be localized and does not descend into the female reproductive organs. A little of the intestine might descend if it did, but this would be relatively easy to correct and it would always return.
However, if the condition persists over time, the incision in the canal will extend further until the intestines and stomach drop into the cavity. This situation occurs due to the extension of the canal that exists in the abdominal region as we mentioned. That is, the incision in the anus extends then relaxes and moves off the spot, causing constipation. The treatment for this is as I described earlier - detailing its description.
And it can be treated with iron on this condition, which is that the patient lies on his back between your hands. Then cut open the warm swelling spot across on a measure of three fingers, and then puncture the pus pockets under the skin.
Even if the white abscess following it is opened, take a thread and place it on the spot under the abscess, pressing it deep into the abdomen. Then stitch both spots at the ends of the thread from the abscess together and sew them to each other.
Then pull the thread's end, do not cut the white abscess completely or touch the testicles. Just follow what I have taught you in treating urinary disorders and then treat it with surgery remedies.
Once the threads have been removed, cleanse the wound and let it heal until it disappears. The abscess will then contract without causing further swelling of the lump.
Iron is the best method in this case as it is closer to safety.
The eighty-fourth chapter.
In relaxing the skin of the scrotum.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without the muscles inside relaxing, making its appearance unappealing. It is advisable for those who wish to treat it to have the patient lie on his back.
And cut all the relaxed skin that hangs off the firm skin. Then join together the edges of the wound, and if you wish to stitch first, sew the relaxed skin with three or four stitches making sure they are strong. Then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with other surgical treatments until it recovers and the threads fall.
The ninety-sixth chapter.
In specialization.
Specialization in our religion is prohibited.
And this is why it was incumbent upon me not to mention it in my book, and I mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that when a doctor is asked about it he may know how to treat it if it occurs to him, and the second reason being that we often need specialization of some animals for our benefit.
Like the sheep, goats, cats and such like animals. I say that specialization can be done in two ways: either by breeding or by cutting and separation, If it's by breeding, its method is to place the animal in hot water until her females relax, become soft and hang down.
Then, with your hand you dissolve it until it cannot be recognized upon touch. As for the specialization by cutting and separation, you should hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its sex organ with your left hand, then tie the hooks and cut each egg with one cut.
Until the two eggs have appeared, cut them after slaughtering them, leaving nothing on them except for the thin scrotum that is on the veins. This method of specialization is better than that which occurs by breeding.
Because breeding might leave something from the females, and then the animal desires intercourse. Then treat the wound until it heals.
The seventyth chapter.
In treating castration.
The female castration occurs in men of two types, one where it appears as below the space or in the skin between the labia minora among women. It looks like a woman's vagina with hair and urine may flow from the one that is in the skin of the scrotum.
And as for women, there is only one type which occurs above the vagina like a man's penis that sometimes extend out of both. They are akin to men's and women's parts, and treatment for all three types exists.
The two types in men and the single type in women require that excess flesh be cut away until it heals, then treated with regular surgical treatment until it clears. As for the second type in men that urinates from the one located in scrotum skin, it has no use or advantage whatsoever.
The 54th chapter.
In cutting the penis and the flesh arising from women's vaginas.
The penis might grow beyond the natural extent and become swollen, making it unappealing. It can also increase in some women to spread like men's, causing them to engage in sexual activity.
You should hold the penis with your hand or a clamp and cut it off. Do not focus on the cut, nor especially at the base of the root, to avoid bleeding.
Then, treat it with surgical care until it heals. As for the regrowing flesh, it is tissue that grows in the womb to fill it.
And it might extend outside like the tail. Therefore, some early medical terms refer to it as the tail disease. It should be cut off in the same manner as cutting the penis, and treated accordingly until it heals.
Chapter 57
In the treatment of hernia.
Hernia is when a woman's vagina is not invaded or has a small hole, which can either be naturally present since birth or secondary. Secondary hernias occur due to some advancement and can be either from excess flesh.
Or a thin or thick opening, which can either be deep within the womb, on its sides, at the top or bottom. It prevents intercourse, menstruation, and childbirth, and possibly urination as well. This is recognized by observation from a gynecologist.
If the obstruction is visible nearby, and if it's not, then you should feel for it with your fingers or by using a small probe. If the obstruction is from thin tissue and near the lips of the vagina, act promptly to resolve it. This involves placing something on the vaginal lips that resembles a tube, followed by placing all fingers of both hands together.
The woman is lying on her back with her legs spread apart. Then, forcefully push the vaginal lips until the thin opening is breached and the obstruction opens. Afterward, take some wool dip it in oil, and place it on that area. She should engage in intercourse every day to prevent the area from healing over again.
If the obstruction is thick and tough, it should be cut with a wide scalpel resembling a paper-thin blade. If the obstruction is from excess flesh, sew it shut with catgut sutures and cut it out. Have ready medications to stop bleeding without anesthesia, such as cacao, garlic, yogurt mixed in egg white, for you.
Then, use a wide copper tube so the wound does not heal quickly. Keep it for days and use dry cotton wicks afterwards. Treat with all other remedies for healing until you recover. In some cases, another flesh-plant may appear in the womb which should be cut out similarly.
If it is not a cancerous tumor, then the cancerous tumor that exists in the womb does not undergo iron treatment necessarily.
The seventy-third chapter.
In the treatment of haemorrhoids, discharges and red warts that occur in women's thighs.
As for haemorrhoids, it is an inflammation of the veins until much blood starts to flow out. If the hemorrhoids advance they become discharges. I have mentioned their types and symptoms in the previous section, and we will now elaborate on them here.
What is acceptable for treatment and what is not, I say that haemorrhoids and discharges when they are in depth of the womb and are not felt by touch do not have a treatment with iron. What comes out from within the womb to be touched is what can be treated.
It is necessary for the woman to enter a cold room, then stretch out her discharges with wire or coarse pick and cut them off at their roots. Then leave it alone when she bleeds from one of the checked points without bleeding profusely.
Like cabbages, herbs, cheese and the like. Then raise her legs up against a wall for an hour, then hang them in cold water if bleeding lasts long, place her in a mixture of saffron, almond shells and pomegranate peels and the like. Take flour from wheat and knead it with honey and vinegar.
Support it on her back, if the bleeding stops otherwise fix the iron cauterizer and both breasts without exception, then take wool and immerse it in the juice of taraxacum or the juice of pregnant cow's tongue or juice of asparagus branches with pomegranate wine, and bind to the position.
If the tumor remains stationary, treat the location with ointment until it heals. As for the red pus, it resembles the heads of maggots in appearance; it should be cut off what is visible according to what was mentioned in the manuals, whether and then treated until it heals.
The 47th Chapter.
In the womb discharging pus that is exhibited.
Various types of tumors may appear in the womb such as cancer, calcified tumor, ulcers, pus-filled conditions, devouring lesions, hernias, hemorrhoids, fissures, scrofula and hot tumors. All these diseases and their various forms along with their signs have been mentioned in this section.
We should mention in this article the hot tumor that appears in the womb among the tumors that persist for a long time. It should be noted that its pus is iron-like. You should observe if there is sharp pain at the beginning of the tumor accompanied by beats, inflammation and fever.
And if I saw it red, do not hurry with its pus and treat it with what promotes maturity until these symptoms stop. Then, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean on her back.
And she should cross her legs towards the lower abdomen, make her thighs spread apart and have her arms under her knees. She should tie them with a belt that fits.
So, the surgeon sits on the right side and uses the instrument that opens the mouth of the womb which will later show its appearance. If you want to use this instrument, you should estimate the depth of the woman's uterus so that the part entering the instrument is not deeper than the uterus.
Involvement of the weak one, if the instrument is more than the depth, it should be advised to place aids on the mouth of the womb's neck to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the womb and the tube that moves within the instrument should be made from above.
And you hold the instrument, and the servant moves the tube until it opens the neck of the womb. If the discharge appears and is felt by hand and if it's very thin, it should be cut at its head with a broad scalpel when all the duration has drained out.
It should be a soft, moistened wick in rose oil or green oil with some grip. The wick should extend out of the incision in the neck of the womb and outside wool is used clean that's soaked in boiling water containing pita bread.
Then it should be treated with the ointment suitable for this purpose for two days until it heals.
And the womb and the wound can be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with boiled water containing mastic or a long mint, and then back to the ointment. If the discharge is inside the womb.
It should be treated with what we have mentioned in this section, instead of iron or any other metal.
The Seventy-seventh Chapter.
In teaching how to treat living fetuses if they have come out in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the natural birth. If you see a woman start to sweat downwards, and she craves for air, it becomes easier for her when she is in labor.
Speeds up the birth of the fetus, understand that this delivery will be natural and its exit will be on his head with the placenta or hanging from his buttocks, if you see these signs it is advisable to squeeze her belly so that the baby can come out quickly.
If it descends on his head, the placenta descends with him and is cleansed from this excess in a good cleaning. And except for this delivery, it is not natural and is condemned because he may come out on his feet and his hands before his head and feet.
And one of his hands or a foot, or he comes out with his head and hand or comes out curled up, maybe he turned on his forehead and such like condemned forms. It is necessary for the midwife to be alert and careful about all these things and to beware of errors and mistakes.
And I explain every form of it and how the trick is there for you to see that and stand by it, if the baby comes out on its head this natural birth happens and it intensifies upon the woman making it difficult for her to push out and I saw that her strength has weakened so I seat her on a chair and command the women to assist her.
And she extends her womb with cooked food and moist drinks, then the midwife inserts a small stick between her fingers to cut the placenta or cuts it with her fingernail until what is inside of its moisture pours out. Then, she squeezes the woman's belly so that the baby can come down.
If it does not descend, it may be necessary to inject the woman with saliva from a stick and anointing oil of the anus. Then she should order her to rest after the injection and blow on her with a gnat's flycomb and cover her mouth and nose. The baby will come out from its place. If one of the baby's hands comes first, it may be necessary gently to fold them back little by little.
If delivery does not occur naturally, lay the woman on a pulpit and lift her legs above. Then shake the pulpit on the ground. The woman should hold herself to prevent falling during shaking. If neither hand can enter and if the fetus has died, cut off both hands and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie her hands with a rope and pull them evenly; he will come out, the birth of the fetus on its feet. If the fetus comes out on its feet, it should be pushed up. Then turn the fetus slowly little by little until you straighten it. Then take one of its legs and extend it slowly.
If they have reached the thighs, ask her to rub herself and brush herself with perfume; he will come out. If it does not come out as described and otherwise, turn the fetus little by little until you make it look natural; then he will come out smoothly at that point. If none of what was described prevails completely.
Take some saliva from the tongue, some pus from the ring, and the oil of the anus and the solution of the scabies, then apply them all on her navel with a good strike. Then pull out her pubis and abdomen bottom, then make her sit in hot water until the sweating reaches
If you notice it's not under her, create a bandage from strips and bear with it. If she holds the bandage for an hour, then sit her on the chair. Then brush her and cover her mouth and nose. Squeez gently under her abdomen, as if milking; the fetus will come out from his place, coming out like the fetus on its knees and hands.
If it comes out like this, occupy the entry of his hands little by little. Then the woman should lie on her head and let her buttocks hang down while she is lying down on a bed, folding her arms. Then gently press above her abdomen. Then remove what is under her heels until it becomes lower. If the fetus does not come out, take all her legs and move them with a strong motion repeatedly. Then gently press on the uterus little by little until the fetus rises above, then the midwife enters her hand and adjusts the fetus little by little.
And command the woman to fast until the fetus is born, the birth of the fetus being delayed due to one of her hands, it occupying the space where she would normally use that hand. If she can't get used to this, make the woman stand and have her walk. If she can't walk, have her lie down on.
Bed her down and shake her legs heavily. Then use the suction tool described from saliva if it takes effect, make her sit on a chair then treat by guiding her arm back into place and adjusting the baby to its natural position. Scold her and command her to fast until the birth occurs.
The birth of the baby should have its head on its forehead, both arms outstretched and its face towards its mother's back. The midwife should then hold the baby's hand, gently turn it little by little, adjusting it carefully until it is properly positioned. Once correctly positioned, apply the described mixture of oil and saliva to her before carrying out the procedure.
Then have her move slightly, if she does this, sit her on the chair and command her to lean towards the right side. Then have her fast and scrape her with the comb, for it will cause the birth of the baby upright from the side.
If it descends to the womb in this condition with the placenta, cut the placenta with your nail until it is saturated with moisture. If it sticks to the baby's face and neck, cut it from behind so that he does not choke and die. Then push the baby inside until you make him as desired.
Instruct the woman to undergo repeated cleansing, as this facilitates a smooth expulsion, like that of twins or multiple younglings. Be aware that many twin births occur and it's possible for three or four children to be born alive, but such cases are rare. As for five children, they are beyond nature; these do not survive at all.
They gather around them, and even if many share one stigma, they separate through discord among themselves. These divisions are separated by an impassable barrier between each of them; they may come out as a single baby would naturally and smoothly, or they emerge with a condemned exit like we described.
If some find it difficult during birth and turn out in the shapes we described as unnatural, they perform their actions as we have described, with the eligible woman doing so gently and cautiously, adapting to every form according to the trick or strategy she has prepared that leads to safety.
Imagining what forms in the womb of embryos, they fall out. It is possible to imagine one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and more than ten forms inside the womb. I have heard that a woman gave birth to seven, and another to fifteen; all of these were imagined within her.
Considering the esteemed, all of this should be within the knowledge of a woman who is capable. Perhaps it might happen to her someday that she will face such circumstances and respond accordingly.
The seventy-fourth chapter.
In the removal of dead babies.
If you treated the dead baby with the treatment as described in the division, and it did not come out, forcing you to work by hand; then, one should observe if she is physically strong and does not have any of the symptoms that might cause harm. If so, the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head will be tilted downwards with her legs elevated, a servant adjusting it from both sides or fastening it to the bed so that her body does not get sucked when the baby is pulled out.
Then he moistens her womb with the moisture of his tongue and saliva from the horse's hoof and liver, and with the pus from the cotton. Then she dips her hand in this moisture and salves, then enters it gently into her womb. She then finds a place for it to be pushed in where pins can be inserted from the fetus, as well as places that match those.
Look, if the fetus is descending on its head, insert the pins in its eyes or forehead, or in its mouth, or in its nose, under his beard, or in raising it, or near the ribs or below the muscles.
And if it is descending on its legs, then in the buttocks and middle back; it should be advisable to hold the pin with the right hand, make contact between the fingers of the left hand, enter gently with the hand, and insert the pin into some of those places that we mentioned.
Until she reaches something empty, then she pushes the opposite side with another pin or a third one if needed to ensure that the pull is equal and not tilted towards any direction. Then she extends for an even length, it's not just on straightness but moves towards every direction.
Ease its exit as is done with a nail when removing it, and in this manner, the extension should relax. If it is being held by one side, it should be advisable to apply some grease on several fingers of the assistant, enter from that side to maneuver what's being held. If some of the baby comes out, then move the pins to another position.
Lift this slightly as you do this so that the baby comes out completely, if it came out before the others and could not be pushed back because of being compressed, it should be looped around its hand then pulled until after coming out completely it is cut.
Either in the elbow joint or in the axilla, and thus you should do this with the other hand and both legs. If the baby's head is large and has been compressed during delivery or if there is collected water on its head, it may be necessary to insert a curved probe between the fingers.
And cut with it the head so that the water comes out, or use a tool called a shidakh (syringe) which you will find images of in the next section following this.
Similarly, if the baby has a large head naturally, you should cut or puncture the skull with the shidakh (syringe) as we said, then remove the bones with forceps. If the head comes out and gets compressed during pressure, you should cut it until the bodily fluids from the chest drain out.
Then the chest joins in. If the chest doesn't join and doesn't come to go out, cut it as much as you can. If it's under the belly, push or if there is a milk sac, you should press until the fluids drain from it.
If the baby is on its legs, pulling it will be easy and adjusting it to the womb opening here. If it gets compressed near the belly or chest, you should pull it with a probe that has been wrapped around your hand until you cut the belly or chest so that what's inside drains out.
If you have removed all organs and the head is returned and blocked, you can use the left hand. If the womb mouth is open, insert your hand into the neck of the womb and guide the head with it, pulling it in with fingers to the womb opening. Then, enter a hook or two hooks inside and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has congealed with a hot tumor, it should not be subjected to violence. Rather, in that case, it is necessary to use substances saturated with moisture and the poultices are used and they sit in water that relaxes and moisturizes.
And if the fetus is on its side, it may be leveled, and then what we have mentioned should be used in the treatment of living fetuses. If that cannot be done, it should be cut off completely and removed. It should not leave any remnants of the placenta inside the body. Once you finish your treatment, apply the treatments for hot tumors that appear in the womb as mentioned.
If there is a bleeding, you should immerse yourself in the water and use all treatments. I have seen a woman who had given birth but her fetus died inside her womb and then she gave birth to another.
Then, another fetus died and after a long time, there was a tumor in her abdomen that inflamed to the point of bursting. It started releasing pus. I was called to treat her, and over a long period of time, despite my treatments, the wound did not heal. I applied some strong absorbing ointments on it.
It removed bones from the place, and days passed, and another bone came out. She was surprised by this because her abdomen is a place that does not have any bones; I thought she had the bones of the dead fetus. I inspected the wound and found many bones, specifically, bones from the head of the fetus.
I continued to follow this until I removed many bones from her. The woman was in the best of health, and indeed, she had been living like this for a long time with a flowing pus that would come out of the place. And it is here that we present these rare conditions.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the surgeon doctor tries to do with treatment.
The seventy-seventh chapter.
There are images of the instruments needed for delivering the baby.
A picture of a spindle that opens the cervix:.
This is the requirement for binding books, whether it has two spindles at both ends of the wood, but this spindle should be softer than the binding and either made of boxwood or of poplar wood. The width of each piece of wood should be as thick as a finger.
And the size of each is towards a finger, with their length being about one and a half feet. In the middle of the wooden pieces are two pegs made from the same type of wood that have been firmly embedded into them; their length should be about half a foot or even more. And these two pegs are used to hold the book together.
These are the two which go into the cervix, and when you guide them in, they will open with the spindles. Here is an image of another tool that is softer and lighter for this task:.
It is made of boxwood or poplar in the shape of arrows, but it has two pegs at its end as you can see. The length of each peg is about a foot and their width is like a finger. If you want to open the cervix with it.
So have the woman sit on a padded bed with her legs spread apart between her thighs. Then, insert these two pegs deep inside the cervix with the tool held by both hands at its lower end under her hips. Then open your hand with the tool as you would do with arrows, to whatever extent of opening you desire for the cervix. Until the midwife achieves what she desires, an illustration of another tool mentioned by the pioneers:.
Illustration of the instrument used to push the baby out:.
Illustration of the tool used to puncture the baby's head:.
It resembles the scissors with teeth on its tip as you see, and it can be made rectangular like this illustration, just as you see. It has saw teeth that cut and smooth.
Illustration of a pushing device:.
Illustration of a hot air balloon:.
This hot air balloon has a slightly hard nozzle so that it doesn't break when drawing the baby with it, illustration of a two-bladed hot air balloon:.
Illustration of broad clamps for cutting the baby:.
All of these tools, the more types they are and the more prepared they are by the manufacturer, the faster the work is done and the higher their standing among people due to their capability. Don't underestimate having a tool ready; there will always be a need for it.
The eighty-seventh chapter.
In the removal of the placenta.
If the placenta becomes stuck after childbirth, you should have the midwife hold herself still and then tickle it out with a catheter. Hold your hand on her mouth and nose. If it comes out this way, otherwise take a portion.
And make a hole in the cover, place there an opened herb like fennel, senna, celery, borage, mint and parsley. Immerse them in water and carry them over heat, then place a silver tube on the cover's hole, leaving the other end at the mouth of the uterus.
Maintain it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then cough as we described, if the placenta comes out quickly. If it did not come out after this treatment and remains, the surgeon is instructed to immerse her left hand in shea butter or saliva from the camel.
Then she enters her hand and searches for the placenta, if it touches it she grasps it and gently holds it for a while until she removes it. If it is adhering deeply in the uterus, then insert the hand as we described until you find the placenta, then gently pull it towards the cervix little by little.
To avoid the uterus falling due to strong suction, it should be gently moved to the right and left sides. Then increase the amount of suction as she will release when then becomes too much and frees herself from adhesion. If the opening of the womb is constricted, we have described the treatment by coughing and other remedies for constipation.
If it doesn't come out as described, you may have to use force in repeating the suction. However, it is necessary to pull what has come out from inside her to her thigh, then bathe her with the four oils, which will cleanse her after a few days.
It dissolves and comes out, except that when it becomes clean, she emits a bad smell to the stomach and head, which harms the patient. It is necessary to use compatible smoke in this situation.
Therefore, some early practitioners have tried using smoke from fig leaves and dried grapes. A picture of the machine that is used to vaporize women during retention of menstrual flow and placenta etc., is what follows:
It is made of lead and resembles a caulking or it is made of copper with the delicate tip placed in the cervix and the wide end on fire. The incense is made to stick until this incense goes away and she replaces it, .
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
In the treatment of the non-pierced stye.
Many boys may produce a non-pierced sty, which might have been blocked by a delicate lump. It should be pricked through by the female's finger if possible; otherwise, she ought to use a sharp forceps and take care not to damage the surrounding tissue.
Then she places a piece of wool that has been soaked in water and oil on it. She then treats it with ointments until it heals. If she fears that it might get blocked again, she puts a lead pipe into the hole for many days, and removes it when the child starts to have bowel movements.
A blocked sty might also result from the healing of a cut or a tumor. It should be surgically incised and then treated with the remedies we have mentioned, such as wool soaked in water and oil, followed by ointment treatment until it heals.
Chapter Eighty.
In the treatment of boils that occur in the lower part.
The boils that occur in the lower part is a complication and hardness that occurs near the anus from outside or within the space on one side. The boil can be single or multiple.
If this hardening opens and water or thin pus flows out from it, it may be white or watery. This could be from one of these boils that have penetrated to the rectum or the intestines, or it might not penetrate at all. The penetrating boil can be recognized by what comes out with bowel movements and wind when using a suppository enema.
It may also have worms coming out from it, and there can be boils if they penetrate to the bladder or to the urethra. They might also penetrate to the hip joint and to the tailbone. There are also those that penetrate to the anus from ones that do not penetrate at all.
To insert your ring finger into the stirrup and to introduce a thin trephine into the epidermis if it is not present, otherwise if it is, insert a thin lead trephine or a hair from horse's mane.
Until you feel the trephine or the hair in your finger, if you do not feel it at all and there is nothing protruding from the hole, no dirt, no smell, as we said, know that it has not penetrated and start treatment immediately.
And if the epidermis penetrates to the bladder or the urethra, its indicator is the passage of urine from it and its inability to heal in response to medications. As for when it penetrates to the knee joint or the tail bone, the sign is reaching the trephine there.
Even if there is no penetration to the bone and pain occurs in a certain direction with continuous pus discharge from it, without healing due to treatment and not healing with time. All these penetrating epidermis have no permanent cure.
Treating it is a futile effort for those who resort to unlearned doctors, however, if it's not penetrating and doesn't have a chronic course, there is hope of healing with iron as I describe and what I've tried. Which involves letting the patient lie on their stomach with the sore part facing you.
He raises his legs upwards and his buttocks inclined towards his belly. A lead or tin trephine is inserted into the epidermis if it has a penetration, until you know where the trephine ends. If he feels it near the stirrup, then your ring finger should be inserted into the stirrup.
And if you feel in your finger that the trephine has penetrated itself, bare and not touching between your finger and flesh or muscle, then you should know for sure that it is penetrating. Do not exert on it as there is no healing from it, as we said.
And they said that in some individuals, particularly those being rare cases and when there is a treatment expected to benefit, they wrap a thin bandage according to the size of the ulcer as described earlier, then place it inside the ulcer until it reaches near the seat. Then remove and replace it two or three times.
Until you learn that it is possible to burn all those excess, fleshy tissues resembling bird's feathers tube, then treat it with a thread dipped in fat until the burned tissues come out. Then treat it with plasters of salted water if he has recovered.
Otherwise, there is no other treatment that can heal without it ever healing again. And if you insert the tool and it doesn't reach to your finger inside the cavity, then there was a thick wall of flesh or cartilage between the tool and your finger when it was inserted. If you saw the ulcer beneath the skin surface below the skin fold, then cut through the skin from the first sign of the ulcer. And you pass the tool through the cut while it's in the ulcer until the cut reaches where the end of the tool is, and then removes the tool and drops it. Then cleans those excess flesh tissues resembling a bird's feather tube, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with salt plasters until it heals. If blood prevails and impedes you from cutting the tissues, then better for you than to do anything is to burn or medicate it sharply because burning with fire combines two good states, which are burning those excess tissues.
Cutting the blood and drying out moisture, then treat it with the thread dipped in fat or sulfur powder mixed with oil until pus forms. The burned tissues are expelled through this pus. Then treat the wound with salt plasters for hard meat healing.
These are the medicines that cause constriction and dispersion. If one is overconstricted, they have relieved the disease without causing recurrence. Provided that the application of oil has reached deep into the pot and beneath the body's surface, then insert your finger into the pot and search with it.
If you feel the obstruction and there is a barrier of the pharynx or flesh between you and it, which is close to penetration, then performing any action in this situation is only on the path of covetousness and hope. That means that one must use any of the three tools as we have mentioned before; either by scraping (like using a tool to remove excess tissue), as we explained earlier.
Alternatively, you might cut into it until you reach its bottom to be able to insert the catheter and treat from close proximity without going too far with the cutting so as not to sever the surrounding tissue. This may lead to bowel movement without desire afterwards, then treat it according to what we have mentioned before; perhaps it would relieve just like we said.
Alternatively, you might penetrate that barrier by cutting until you're close to the catheter opening as we have said, either using a tool like forceps or with another sharp-edged device. Then remove all swollen tissues in that cut up to where you can reach by probing it thoroughly.
Then, cleanse the entire surgical wound along with the cut and upper mouth until it closes completely. Leaving the oil open inside the catheter will be gentler on the patient. The oil may stick in this form.
And when you insert the forceps into the oil and it is towards one side of the catheter, near the body's surface with the skin and belt around the catheter, take a forceps with its tip sharpened like an awl needle in this manner:.
And place five threads or close to this within her, then insert the pincers with the thread into the anus until it reaches its bottom. If it enters in the edges of the seat from inside near.
And withdraw the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and pulling out one end of the thread, then join both ends together and tighten them. Leave it for a day or two, each time cutting off any thread that has cut through the flesh with a good pull until those tissues between the ends of the threads are cut and fall off. Then treat the wound until it heals completely.
And if the anus opening is not dilated, expand it as much as you can so that there will be a lot of depth. Do not do this because of the muscle to avoid cutting into it. Then proceed with it as we have mentioned until complete recovery.
The scissoring clamp that cuts through the anal canal has a very sharp edge on one side for cutting. The other side is not sharp to avoid cutting unnecessary areas as shown.
The sixtieth and eighth chapter.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids that bleed, cutting them, and treating fissures.
Hemorrhoids can be divided into two types, either they are inside the anus resembling blood vessels or like grapes and come in small and large sizes, with blood continuously dripping from them.
They can be singular or numerous, and they can be outside the anus, especially at its extremities. However, these that are outside the anus occur less frequently; they exude yellowish water or slightly bloody fluid continuously, and they have the color of the skin.
Treating what is inside the bed (i.e., internal afflictions) involves commanding the patient to urinate and defecate until the bed is cleared and the stools are visible to you. You should then rush to bind them with ropes or hold them by your thumb, and cut them off at their roots; if the ropes do not stick because of their wetness and relaxation.
Pull it off with a coarse razor or a piece of sharpened wood, or draw it out with your fingers, then cut it off. After the cut, leave some sharp points on it to replace the clamps, or break it into pieces as described in the section about clamps.
Then treat it with all other remedies until it heals. If the bed doesn't come out, inject a slightly cold pricking into the patient to wash what's in the bed and induce rapid urination when he feels the urge to defecate. As for the stools coming out of the bed, command them gently.
It involves holding it with your thumb or attaching it to a hook and cutting it, then treating it as we've mentioned until it heals. If you dislike cutting with iron tools, it might be better to use thread on this condition: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then, draw the hair upwards and extract it using a needle from its root on the opposite side. Twist both ends of the thread under the needle which is placed in front, pull the hair tightly with the thread, then tie the thread. Extract the needle afterwards. You perform this procedure for all hairs and leave one untouched.
To drain off the blood from it, then place a grease-soaked razor (made of beeswax or copper) on the bed and put it in place. Command the patient to stay still, then leave him until he passes the stools. Once they have passed, treat them with ointments and other remedies until healing occurs.
If it comes to treating diarrhea, it often involves clearing the nostril obstructions and trapping the secretion. If one tries but fails in this treatment, a remedy seems necessary where one should remove the affected part with the surgeon's saw or your nail until it becomes moist and removes the upper layer of skin that prevents its healing.
Then treat it until it fully heals, if it doesn't heal completely, continue by removing more intensely than the first time until it fully heals and scars. Then treat it; it will recover.
The second and fortieth chapter.
In the treatment of inverted and non-inverted tacks, dry thorns, and ants.
The tack, it is merely a wound that is tightly knotted and resembles the head of a tack. It exists in all parts of the body, but particularly in the lower limbs and fingers, causing pain when walking.
It is necessary to cut around the tack, hold with a rasp or file, and pull it from its root. Then treat it; if you wish, reinforce it as described in the section on this topic. As for dry thorns, each one of them is a small, coarse, tightly wound, tightly knotted protrusion above the body's surface.
It often occurs in the hands of boys, and its treatment is to moisten the thread and cut it or twist it with a silk thread or a hair strand until it falls off. You can reinforce it as described using fire or medicine if you wish.
The inverted and non-inverted thorns can be removed using the tool I mentioned for treating ants. As for the ant, it is also a small, tightly wound, thick protrusion on the body that goes very deep inside. If it gets cold, you'll feel it as if stung by an ant.
In the entire body, and more so in the hands, its treatment involves taking a tube from an otter's or a strong eagle's feather. This tube is made to surround the ant until it encircles all sides of the tube. Then you should move your hand with the tube until it cuts around the ant.
Make it deep into the flesh, and remove the ant from its root. If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube as depicted here.
The top of the tube should be rounded and slightly indented to make it easier for fingers to control and grip. If desired, you can attach the ant as explained in chapter three regarding the attachment of feathers, within the section on attaching items.
The thirty-eighth chapter.
In the diagrams of machines used for injection in cases of constipation, diarrhea, and dysentery.
The syringe can be made from silver, porcelain, or copper. It can also be hollow or polished copper. The size of the device is made small or large depending on who uses it. The syringe used for treating smaller children would be small, as their intestines are narrow or constricted. For those whose rectums are tight, the syringes would be very gentle. Here is a picture of a large syringe:.
The top part of the clamp, where you attach the nozzle, is wide and has a barrier in it. You connect the nozzle as shown here, and the lower end that enters the anus is very smoothly flattened to roundness on one side with two holes on one side, and there's one hole on the other side.
The size of the hole should be suitable for the thickness of the material being pushed or slightly thicker. The nozzle where medications are placed, from an animal bladder or a sheep's skin membrane made in the shape of a small flask, has a diameter of about a finger-width.
It makes many holes as it rotates, with a hard finger between each hole. Then, it enters through each of these holes a thin thread from two out of ten threads or roughly that amount, and bunches it together like a bundle. If medicine is put in it, pull on the syringe's head between the stones strongly and tightly, then inject it. This is a picture of the nozzle hole and the injection area:.
And the method of using it is to fill the bladder or urine bag with medicine while it's heated as much as possible, be cautious not to make it excessively hot or cold. Then, the patient lies on his back and raises his legs upwards.
He should place under him a pad or a mat, then grease the tip of the syringe with grease or chicken's egg white or saliva, and so forth. Then he inserts it gently into the anus. The person performing the operation holds both ends of the nozzle in his hands and squeezes firmly until all the contents of the syringe are forced into the intestine.
Then, the syringe is removed and the patient raises his legs up to the wall. If the medicine has pushed him out, he would be expelled what he could. If he slept through the night, it was more beneficial for the treatment. If the medicine was given in cases of diarrhea and if its exit was hastened, then let the injection occur until he is relieved.
If there are painful passageways or swellings in the anus, let the syringe be very smooth and gentle compared to those used for children. This is an image of a gentle syringe with its skin bound on it:.
The forty-eighth chapter.
In treating surgical wounds.
I have mentioned in the section about treating what resembles abscesses, and I am now detailing here their treatment both by hand and with medications at perfection. Therefore, it is evident that surgical operations vary according to the nature of the thing on which surgery is performed, and according to the location of the wound.
The matters in which surgical operations occur are many, like a stone fracture or an incision from a sword or knife, or a dart injury, or by a spear or stick, and so forth for numerous other items.
As for the surgeries according to body locations, they are like wounds that occur on the head or neck, chest or abdomen, liver and so forth among organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some surgeries to establish norms and laws for other surgical procedures, starting with simple head injuries. This is because their detailed explanations will be provided in the initial sections of the third chapter of this book.
I say that when a simple head injury occurs and no bone fracture is present, upon examination if it was caused by a stone or something similar and only the skin has been pulled to cause a large wound with fear of heat-induced tumor formation in the affected person, one should immediately and forcefully detach the horsehair from its place. Do not delay in doing this, and let him bleed out as much as his strength allows if it is not prevented by a hinderer. Especially if the bleeding from the wound is minimal; allow the bleeding from the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against filling up, drinking water, and consuming thick foods. If preventing bleeding is impossible, limit his food intake, avoid meat and drinks, and apply a cloth soaked in rose oil or mixed with its drink if it has an analgesic effect. Also, bear on wounds should any heat-induced tumor occur there.
If the hot tumor is benign, hold it on the wound if it's soft with its own blood and not altered by the air. As I will describe to you shortly, after that. And if it was altered by the air, hold it with some ointments.
Until the pus drains and it is treated until recovery, if the wound is large and was caused by a sword or similar means and its edges do not meet with the sutures, stitch it together with what I am describing to you in stitching abdominal surgery.
If the skin was stripped of bone and adhered, but its retention was only in a gentle adhesion, cut it. Then treat the wound with medicines that harden in it meat instead of the skin. And make sure that he eats food that has hardness such as horns, nuts, etc.
If there was a pus in the skin that did not adhere to the bone, cut out all the pus and throw it away. Then treat it, if in these surgeries there is a vessel or sweat gland bleeding blood from it and the bleeding has not been stopped by medicines, probe into the vessel.
If it was hit and did not bleed, make him bleed with a pair of forceps and bind it. If necessity demands that even if the previously mentioned didn't work, let him bleed until the blood stops. If these surgeries are small and simple, treating them is easy; they just need to be left on this 'it' by its own blood.'
Before it is altered by the air, the recipe of 'it' (presumably referring to a specific substance or method) instructs to take from milk one part and from beeswax two parts, and from extinguished or unextinguished tallow three parts. Grind all of them together, sift them and apply this mixture on the wound with firm pressure until it adheres well.
The blood is allowed to coagulate, then tightened from above by the veins and left undisturbed until it does not swell. If it doesn't cause swelling, medicine cannot be expelled from him until he recovers. And this can be achieved by the iron alone if milk and saffron are unavailable.
This action can also be performed with the use of two fingers in many major surgeries if it is done correctly and tightened onto them, and when the operations were moistened by their blood as long as no change occurred due to air. However, if some changes did occur due to air, especially during summer time.
There is no effective purpose in placing this poultice as we mentioned that it can carry some mature ointments or a paste made from the flour of barley mixed with water and honey until it releases pus, then treat it with other remedies until recovery occurs.
And if there is a fracture in the wound that is slight, attract it with the gout. I have mentioned the treatment for head fractures as they are being treated further, in neck surgery. If the injury occurs in the neck, there is no difference in the treatment between a head injury if it was simple.
And if an nerve or artery was cut from the neck, if it is a nerve then there is no trick other than to avoid treating it with things that tighten tightly like the comb and the ague and similar because they hurt the nerve and irritate it.
No cold thing should be placed on the wound because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection with the brain which is the most noble of organs. The medicine you treat it with, like moistened with pure water, wax ointment or with rose oil or castor oil will have to be done many times by being dipped in oil or applied as a paste.
If it is also washed with sweet water and all the metallic stones in this manner, and if the ointment is moistened, then for a large wound use stitches or bring together its lips with the aids, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has depth and a hidden cavity at its bottom where pus has accumulated, wash it in the lowest place available. If there was a severed artery within the wound and you cannot stop its bleeding, then bind it or tie it off, or use a ligature if necessity requires that.
If the wound has cut through some of the rings or all of them and the tendons are released, sew together the skin's edges with stitches on the bony ring of the finger without touching the bone. Do not leave any knots under the skin when you stitch; instead, return it to its natural shape and pull tight firmly for a few days.
Then treat it with ointments that have the properties of clotting and drying until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, probe it. If there are pieces of bone in it, remove all of them or what you can; if not, leave it as it is until the wound discharges and heals making its removal easier.
If the wound is tender, sprinkle it with the powder that we described. If bone has accumulated in the wound and hardened into a lump, treat it using what will be mentioned within its chapter, in thoracic surgery and between the shoulders.
If it is a thrust from a spear or a knife and you see that there's depth in the wound, observe: if blood escapes when air flows out of the wound during respiration, then you know it's a fatal injury. If she doesn't show any depth and is tender by its own blood, don't apply any powder to it immediately nor tighten it too much for fear that the blood might get trapped in her wound.
Calling for the heart, it kills the weak one, but make it twice attractive and wash it in the day two times. If his medicine doesn't reach him, put a small cotton ball in the wound to absorb what comes out of moisture, and have the poor's sleep on the wound.
If there is a gathering of pus even if it has been three days or more since the wound occurred and the patient doesn't show any severe twitching or weak heartbeats, nor feels constriction in their chest, and if you find that all other conditions are suitable, know that the wound is healed. Treat it with rest and the rest of treatment until recovery.
If it's impossible to see it or the pus continues to accumulate, know that it has turned into an abscess. The patient who sleeps on the wound does not allow what gathers there. Even if there was time passed for the front or back chest wound, treat it with stitches as mentioned.
If it is large or perhaps if it's small, if it has affected the bone and broken pieces off of it, then explore the wound and take action to remove those pieces. If they are clean, do so; if not, leave them alone until they are.
Wash the wound as it facilitates its removal, and as for other acute wounds occurring in other organs, their management is governed by what we have mentioned.
The fifty-eighth chapter.
In abdominal surgeries, the removal of intestinal contents and their缝合.
The breach that exposes the abdomen can be large, small or in between. The larger one might remove one or more intestines, making its insertion and sewing much harder.
The smaller breach may complicate matters from another perspective; it must necessitate a harder return of the intestinal contents, and if you don't promptly place them back to their correct position, they will swell and harden making their insertion even more difficult. For this reason, the larger breaches are often considered better because it doesn't make returning the intestines as difficult as these two types do.
Know that sewing of the abdomen is on four aspects. The two general stitches are suitable in sewing of the abdomen and other bodily surgeries, while the other two special stitches apply to all surgeries except they are more specialized for sewing of the abdomen.
And I will describe it to you one by one with explanation and clarification, so I say that if the wound is small and something of the entrails came out and it was difficult to push back, then there are two reasons for this: either due to the smallness of the tear as we said, or because of the exposure of air expansion before the cold wind.
If this is the case, it should be heated by soaking a sponge or a wet incision in hot water alone, or cooked in it with wine, saffron, and nutmeg until the air expands dissolves.
And it is possible to do that drink which is held in captivity, which is better than water alone for dissolving the air expansion; if you see that the air has dissolved, then pour the intestines with water that was cooked with myrrh or baker's yeast; it flows into them more easily.
If it is not possible for him to return after this treatment, then slightly cut the tear with the tool that cuts through nails and when the first treatment succeeds better than the cut, he will be forced to cut later due to necessity and inability of alternatives. This is an example of the tool: .
One side of it is curled and limited, while the other side is unlimited. The delicate end should not be sharp like a blade but rather slightly blunt. It resembles a small soldering iron as you see; if the wound widens and the intestines enter, then it should be pushed back in its natural shape.
The specific place for it, if you can achieve this, is better. If the rupture is extensive and at the bottom of the abdomen, it should be desirable for the patient to lie on his back with his legs raised above his head. If it's in the upper part of the abdomen, he should have his head and chest elevated above the lower part.
And likewise, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, make your intention and purpose always that side where the surgery area is higher than the other. Thus, it should be used in major surgeries and in medium ones.
And in minor surgeries, place him according to what you can manage. Then prepare at your side a waiter companion who holds the rupture with both hands and closes his lips, then he reveals something after something to the ones sewing.
This is the general rule for simple sewing, which involves taking a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound. Then, you leave from the edge of the cut the thickness of the tendon and pierce one needle without inserting any thread into the edges of the skin. With my fingers of the tunnel beneath the skin from inside, until I pass it from that part. Having gathered my edges of skin and my edges of the tunnel, they became four threads. Then, I pull a double thread around the needle on both sides several times, so that the cut edges come together tightly.
Then, leave the thickness of the finger as well, and pierce another needle. Then, knot it with thread like what you did with the first needle; do not stop doing this for the number of needles you need until you sew all parts of the cut. The needles should be medium between hardness and softness.
Because needles with thin and sharp points cut the flesh and the ligaments very quickly, hence it is necessary that they are medium in softness and hardness. It should not be that the needle pierces near the edge of the skin too deeply.
So that the flesh is not cut too quickly and the wound does not open before healing, nor should it be too far apart by stitching so as to prevent the wound from healing. Then, the ends of needles should be cut so that they do not harm the patient during sleep and they make him wadding from a tear in each side to hold the needle ends.
And leave it until he learns that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is so effective in small surgeries because you may be able to stitch it using just one or two needles, or about that number.
As for the stitching technique of the second common method, it involves sewing together the four edges or borders: the inner edge of the skin and the inner edge of the wound in one go using a single needle with a thread that is moderately firm and medium-hard. Then after this needle has gone through all four edges, I would repeat the needle from where I started itself.
The thread should fall intertwined from above the wound, making the stitching like tying an oar where tension is put on it and there's a small space between every stitch and each stitch after tightening the little finger. This kind of stitching is known by everyone.
With this stitching, I performed an operation on a man in his stomach who was wounded by a knife. The wound was more than ten inches long and blood had flowed out of his intestines almost two inches from the center intestine. The injury was in the middle of the abdomen.
He waited for twenty-four hours after the completion of his convalescence outside the wound. The wound healed in about fifteen days and he treated it until he recovered, living on afterwards for many years. He managed all situations properly and doctors judged him never to have fully recovered.
And it is surprising that I did not treat him with my own preparation, because at the place where I was there was nothing of medicines. Instead, I would apply used cotton to the wound twice a day and promised to wash it with honey water until he recovered.
As for the two types of special suturing, I remember Galen's description which is that you should start sewing from the skin and pierce the needle from outside to inside. Once the needle has entered the skin and through the underlying muscle longitudinally throughout the entire abdomen in a straight line.
I left the wound margin of the scrotum on the side where I inserted and passed the needle, then I pierced the other edge of the wound from inside to outside in the other canal of the urethra. Once she has passed through it, she passes it again into this same canal from the urethra from outside to inside.
And leave the wound margin of the scrotum on this side, then pierce the needle into the other edge of the wound from inside to outside. And while doing so, push it through the scrotum to the canal in its area until all of them are pierced.
Then also start from the same side and guide it along with the wound margin of the scrotum on the other side. Remove the needle from the skin near him, then fold it back into that skin and guide the scrotal wound margin along with this canal in the urethra.
Remove it from the skin originating from its side, do that once again and do it multiple times until you sew up all of this surgical example. The description of this sewing is that it sews in like the stitches on a camel's hide.
By sewing the wound from one side with a margin of the skin and then leaving it from the other side until you finish, as for the second type of characteristic stitching mentioned by Galen, this is precisely his written description.
And it is that you sew it according to a model, as some of the healers stitch it by gathering every part to its counterpart with natural issues, they incorporate the margin of the wound to its other margin and the margin of the mucus bag to its other margin. This is what I describe to you.
It is necessary that you insert the needle into the mucus bag close to you from outside and pass it inside of her alone, leaving your margin on the wound. Then you return the needle and pass it again from outside to inside in both margins of your wound.
And you pass it from inside to outside in the margin of the other mucus bag on the opposite side, this method of sewing is better than the easy common sewing which she presented, this is precisely what Galen says. And some say that abdominal stitching can be done with two needles. And this is to enter them with a single thread and start by inserting the needle from you and passing it to the other side, then insert the other needle from the opposite side of him according to the tent sewing technique regardless.
And know that if the puncture is in the middle of the abdomen, its stitching is more difficult than the other parts of the abdomen. As for treating the wound, it follows the rule of all surgeries, which means when you close the wound tightly with blood before the air changes it and retracted the pus and sewed it properly; then bear on him the heavy burden of the ointment.
If the wound has been altered by air, apply some of those ointments that cause it to pus and remove threads until it heals and discharges. Then suture and close the wound, then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals fully.
If no medicines are available, keep the wound moist until it begins to produce pus. Change the dressing twice a day as you have been taught until it heals. Generally, if the wounds are simple, there is usually no need for further treatment after they start draining pus. I fear that the wound might share the pain of the main organs with them.
You should soak a small piece of cotton in moderately heated oil or rose butter and place it around the areas between the ribs and abdomen. If he feels pain or itching, this often indicates that it is infected; you should then administer him a sip of a strong, fuming black drink.
And especially if the infection has reached the intestines and formed an open wound into its inner part. Know that if the intestinal contents were hard, it would be easier to heal; and if they were thin, healing would be more difficult.
As for the intestines known to fasting people, they do not accept healing from surgery that affects them completely due to their numerous blood vessels and bones, and the softness of their muscle tissue being close to nerve tissue. And if the protrusion from the wound is a hole that was soft when discovered, return it according to your response for your intestines, whether it's the same or not.
If he has waited for a period and his wound turns green or black, it may be necessary to tie a thread above the affected area in order to prevent bleeding. There are blood vessels and arteries inside the hole. Then cut off the bandage below this point.
You make both ends of the thread attached from below outside the surgical incision, making it easier for you to pull and remove when the pus drops and the wound heals. It mentions the wound that appears in the abdomen, whereas if there is a rupture in the abdomen and it is small,
It is possible that some people may not heal properly, as I have seen a man who had been pricked in his abdomen by an arrow and the wound was on the right side of the stomach. I examined the wound and it turned black, emitting feces and air from it. I let him suffer knowing that I did not hope for his recovery. I continued to care for him until he recovered and the wound healed properly. When I saw that the wound had fully healed, I feared for his welfare in case there was a bad event inside him, but fortunately no such bad event occurred and he remained in the best of health conditions. He is healthy, eats and drinks, has intercourse, enters the bathroom, prays in his service. Some experienced people have mentioned that if a small wound appears in the abdomen, it should be treated according to this description.
He instructs that the bigger ants should be taken with their heads, then both sides of the wound are gathered together. Then one puts an open-mouthed ant from them onto each side of the wound. When it clings to him and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off and sticks there without dissolving. Another ant is placed near the first one.
Continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then reverse and sew the wound. Those heads will remain stuck in the abdomen until the intestine heals and recovers, without causing any harm to the patient. It may also be possible for the intestine to get stuck with the thin thread as well.
The one who removes two snakes from the animal bound to it after entering a needle, takes this thread's end from the snakes and removes them smoothly. Then he ties a fine silk thread that is wound around at its end, and then enters that thread into the needle. In it is thread from the snake that touches the intestines, then returns to the belly cavity. This kind of sewing with the needle and snake thread is only on the path of greed and hope.
And if the hole is large and wide, especially if it's in one of the small intestines, there is no trick or escape at all.
The sixtieth chapter.
In the treatment of sore throat and swollen glands.
Understand that every cut or tumor, if it persists and progresses, becomes a wound that does not heal and keeps discharging pus constantly. When this happens continuously without stopping in any part of the body, it is generically called an 'abscess', which we specifically refer to as a sore throat and swollen glands.
He is, in reality, a complex tangled hard white lump with pain, having a cavity like that of a bird's feather.
That's why some of them call it a feather, and at times it is moist constantly discharging pus. And in other times the moisture may stop. The amount of this moisture can vary being abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
And when mentioning surgeries in the division, it was stated that every wound does not heal or grow flesh within it, for this is due to one of nine reasons. One of these might be due to lack of blood in the body, another could be due to its deficiency, and yet another reason could be because there's hardened flesh inside it and on its edges which prevents the growth of healthy flesh. Whether it is due to excessive pus and foul smell, or because the ulcer itself is infectious and the substance supplying it is of poor quality, or because the medicine used for treatment is not suitable, or because there was a mishap involving the disease's nature, or because of a specific condition in the locality.
Whether it is due to excessive pus and foul smell, or because the ulcer itself is infectious and the substance supplying it is of poor quality, or because the medicine used for treatment is not suitable, or because there was a mishap involving the disease's nature, or because of a specific condition in the locality. As discussed in the city of Sircustata where it is difficult to achieve maturation of diseases and there's a natural delay in the treatment of tumors, this may also happen when there is one bone or multiple bones there. All these reasons and their symptoms have been illustrated with medications in the section.
I should inform you here about the treatment of syphilis and gout, which is performed through hand work. Know that syphilis can occur in all body parts; some of them end up in large arteries and veins or to nerves.
Or to the lungs, or to the stomach, or to the bladder, or to a rib of the ribs, or to a joint in the compound joints such as the hand and foot, and some go close to a main body part like an organ and so forth.
If these ulcers had this quality, they are diseases that are easy to cure and do not require treatment or effort, as treating them is a waste of time. But if there were ulcers that did not reach the places I mentioned and for which you hoped and desired treatment, it would be different.
And I wanted to understand this, so take a steel or iron probe if the syphilis is on straightness and scrape it with it. If there is a curvature in the syphilis, examine it with a thin lead probe because lead makes his body soft.
When entering, it twists towards the ascent. If the scabs have many mouths that you cannot discern with a pick tool, then block one of its mouths from his other mouths. The wetness filled through it will flow to the other mouths.
Then conduct an inspection on it in whatever way you can to determine if there is bone or nerve, if the scab's depth is far or close, or if it has a single mouth with multiple apertures. You should be able to ascertain its existence through pain when you touch the area with your hand using all of your resources.
And in this manner among the signs and causes of tumors, if you stand upon all these truths then proceed with certainty to treatment. The cure is that you should examine it; if it (the tumor) shows symptoms indicating its nature.
The scabs appear close by or in a healthy position far from joints, nerves, arteries, veins or any of the places you were informed about. Cut into the scabs according to the descriptions given and remove what is inside containing necrotic tissues and excess flesh.
What grows in its mouth from flesh or canals and such, heal it until it is cleansed. If the scab is far from depth and is straight, it should be necessary to cut deeply as much as possible into it then remove all of its rotten flesh.
Then use the processed garlic in strong medicines and place it into the depth of the scab which you reach with iron, do this multiple times until that strong medicine eats up all remaining decay within the scab's depth.
Then force him with the ointments that promote healthy tissue growth until he heals. If it does not heal in this way, cut and remove it as previously described. Should you suspect that the cause of the scab is bone and confirm this to be true, puncture and cut it as informed; if there's a deterrent stopping you.
If you encounter a vein, nerve or major body part as we said before, and if it opens up to you and shows some decay or blackening, cleanse it until the decay goes away. Then treat it with what will bind back together so that it heals. If it doesn't heal properly and continues to secrete phlegm as it was doing previously, then continue treating it accordingly.
Know that if you have not reached total removal of the decay, uncover everything else again and thoroughly remove, cleanse it with all your efforts. Then force him (the body), if he heals properly. Otherwise, know that this decay is far from complete; uncover everything else again.
Thoroughly remove and cleanse it with all your efforts. The rotten bone was a small bone, and you could draw it (extract it). Draw it using the gentle hooks that are suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, thoroughly uncover and remove them all from it, leaving nothing behind with your effort. If something in the ligaments prevents you without causing danger during removal, cut those ligaments along with any attached flesh and liberate the bones.
If you do not have the time to remove the bones from the wound, cover it with something that cleanses and leave it for days until all around those bones is cleared of flesh and ligaments. Keep the wound open so that no closure occurs at the incision made during your work.
But place on it, if you fear this, cotton dipped in powdered sulfur oil or cotton dipped in Egyptian balm or one of the green ointments. If these cleanse those ligaments and purify the bones, extracting and drawing them will be easier.
If it is a large bone, like the thigh bone or such, and if decayed only on its surface, cleanse it completely until all blackness and decay disappear. Then force this wound to close properly; however, if the decay spread within to a considerable part of the bone, spreading would be necessary.
Cut everything up until you reach the extent of the corruption. Then treat it until it heals. And I will tell you about a disease that was presented to someone in their leg as an example and aid for your treatment, this man went through old age.
By the thirtieth year, he was suffering from pain in his leg due to movement within the body. The materials reached the leg and it swelled up; a huge tumor formed inside him, not because of an external reason. Over time, with errors made by doctors, the tumor finally opened.
Materials flowed out in large quantities and he was poorly treated for his condition until the leg became infected with numerous small openings, all of which were discharging pus and bodily fluids. A group of doctors worked on him for two years, but there wasn't one among them skilled enough to perform surgery.
Even so, I saw his leg and the materials were flowing from those openings like a great stream. The man's body had disintegrated and his skin had turned yellow in color. So, I inserted the forceps into one of those openings and guided the forceps to the bone before I opened all of them.
I found that some parts of the tumor led to each other from all directions in the leg. I was spurred on and made a cut into one of those openings until I revealed part of the bone, which I found to be rotten, darkened, decomposed and full of pus. I extended this hole down to the marrow and spread what I had discovered.
I removed the rotten bone, assuming that there was no other corruption in the bone which I had cut and spread. I then removed it, and after applying medicinal plasters for a longer period of time, it did not heal. So, I went back to uncover the bone again above the initial discovery.
I found the infection connected to the bone, so I spread out what was revealed to me of that infection. Then I tried to force it but it did not yield or stick on him. Afterwards, I uncovered it as well, and kept cutting parts of the bone and trying to manipulate them until I had cut about a span from the bone.
And I removed it with its fat, and then manipulated him with medicines; he quickly healed and recovered. This repetition in his operation and dissection was necessary due to the weakness of the patient, his low tolerance, and my fear of his death, as he would suffer from extreme depletion at all times leading to bad infection which resulted in complete recovery.
A firm flesh grew in the place of the bone, his condition improved within him, his strength reduced and he started behaving normally without any harm from walking. If a bone had broken in one part of the body.
It is necessary to apply this method which involves taking a band and tightening it on the protruding bone, instructing someone else to hold it up, and then placing another thicker band of wool over the first one.
Then, you tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and extend its end so that it draws the flesh downwards as you lift up the flesh from the desired spreading location to avoid injuring the moving flesh. You place a board or plank underneath the bone from below firmly.
For if you did that, the bone was not prevented from breaking and removing the infected part. It is necessary for spreading to be slightly above the location of infection so it doesn't end up inside the bone cavity where it wouldn't be visible to touch; thus requiring another round of spreading.
If the bone is decayed and not congenital but some parts are connected to each other with decay in its center or in some parts, cut open all sides of the flesh. Then place the wood from below first, then spread it from the first side where decay occurred.
If you have finished spreading it from one side, then spread it from the other side. The distance for spreading should be slightly less than what we said where decay occurs in a joint. If decay is found in a joint, cut out the decayed part of the joint itself and spread the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the decay is found in a connection between two joints, there's no trick other than amputation. If the decay is within the wrist or ankle joint, treating it is extremely difficult but you should remove and clean all visible decay, then amputate and purify as much as possible.
And how do you stabilize it when there is no interference from sweat or nerve, and remember that the cuts and grooves for these bones vary greatly depending on the position of the bone, its orientation, its hardness, density, size, thickness, hardness, and porosity. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare for every type of work its own problem-solving tool.
And know that the works themselves may guide you on the type of tool you need if you have a long road and knowledge in the art of this craft, for it is part of the craftsmanship skill and witness to various diseases. One can derive for themselves what suits them from tools for each disease, and I will show you several tools at the end of this chapter.
Make them examples to be emulated and standards by which you measure with others if Allah willing, an illustration of a scraper:.

Chapter seventy-eight.
In cutting off the limbs and dispersing the bones.
Limbs may decay due to a cause from outside or inside. If the decay is treated with medicinal remedies and they do not work, and you see the decay progressing in the member without anything deterring it.
In order to do this, the organ should be cut at the point where decay has reached, so as to save the patient from death or a great misfortune which is worse than losing the organ. A sign of someone who was given this treatment is that they will cover the organ until one thinks that fire had burned it.
Or until the blackness whitens, at which point this white will extend beyond that organ and spread throughout the body as a whole; in such cases, you should immediately cut it. Similarly, if the cause of decay is due to a bite from sea snakes or vipers or leeches and suchlike creatures, proceed with its removal.
If decay or the bite is in a finger, cut off the finger and do not allow the decay to spread to the hand. Similarly, if it spreads into the hand, cut it from the wrist's origin and do not let the decay spread until it reaches up towards the elbow.
Likewise, if it spreads into the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow joint in its entirety. If decay has advanced so far as to reach the knee, do not simply amputate the knee; instead, there is death for the patient in that case. Apply other remedies of this kind according to your ability.
And similarly, if decay has spread to the toe, cut off the toe at one of its joints. If it spreads up to the ankle bone in the leg, then amputate the entire leg. If it ascends further and reaches up to the knee, then amputate the thigh above the knee joint.
And if the decay has reached above the knee, there is no solution except to let it be and accept death for the patient. The prescription for cutting off an organ or spreading decay involves tightening a band below the desired cutting location, then another band on top of that area.
The attendant stretches one band down and the other attendant stretches the upper band up. The flesh is freed between the bands with a wide scalpel until all the flesh is revealed, then it should be cut or spread out. It is necessary to place cotton thread from all sides.
So that the knife does not touch the correct place causing unnecessary pain and inflammation, if you experience bleeding during your work, cover the area quickly or hold it with some clotting agents for blood. Then proceed with your treatment until completion.
Then, bandage the wounded member with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will give you an example of this affliction to one person on his leg which I am describing to you - that when there was blackness accompanied by a burning sensation like fire on his leg.
That corruption was the first thing that happened to his finger, until he lost all of them. When the man saw the corruption spreading in his member with such intense pain and burning sensation, he cut it at the joint, then healed.
After a long time had passed, this corruption appeared in his little finger of his dominant hand. He came to me and I used the medicine that was on my hand after cleaning him from head to toe against this corruption. But the corruption did not subside; it spread to the other finger instead.
Until the corruption reached his hand and he called me to cut it off. I pleaded with him not to do that for the sake of getting rid of this corruption, and I was also afraid for him when cutting off his hand because his strength seemed like it might give out. After his hope failed, he returned to his homeland.
I heard that he cut off his hand completely and healed. I'm telling this story to serve as a guide in understanding such occurrences, and to provide evidence and a reference for how to deal with this kind of illness.
The eightieth and eighth chapter.
In the treatment of abscesses and methods for administering medications to them.
If a tumor occurs in some of the muscular organs and lasts for an extended period until the duration of the tumor reaches that point, then it bursts or explodes and releases all that was inside its duration, leaving the place empty like a container.
The skin on it is like a tear, having thickened and not being excessively infected that I would pierce through bone or nerve or muscle腱. It's for this reason that it deserves to be called an abscess and not a gangrene, except when its duration prolongs until the infection affects something in these organs.
In that case, it is called gangrene or putrefaction, and its treatment is to cut out the entire skin as it turns around, especially if it has thickened and become like a tear, and you are sure that it does not stick to the site due to its infection.
If you hope that the skin will stick and its infection hasn't reached this extent, and there is thickening of meat in the skin, then treat it with puncturing. This involves examining the abscess; if it's large and the pus coming from it has a foul smell, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
This is a mixture of egg, oil, honey, and niter, which when gathered in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens and becomes thick as honey, then take what you need, mix it with water and honey, inject it into the abscess and tighten its opening. Leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then squeeze it by pressing, do this for days until the abscess clears and all impurities are gone. It might be injected with ash water if this medicine is not available to you. This involves taking charcoal from date wood or oak wood, soaking it in water.
Then cleanse the wound and insert it until you are sure that the contaminant has been washed away. If there is no possibility of using Egyptian medicine or ashes water in the whitewash, wash it with water and honey which has a little powdered niter mixed in.
Or inject it with honey and drink mixed together, because honey has the ability to cleanse and wash away while alcohol sticks to the contaminant, especially if there is a preference for capturing and drying in the drink. If you do this several times and are sure that the contaminant has been eliminated from the wound, then clean it out with something that promotes tissue growth.
For example, you can take the dragonfly ointment and replace it with almond oil and rose oil mixed with a drink that has a grabbing effect, or inject it with some other ointments and drugs whose properties we have proven in the article on ointments. If the opening of the contaminant is narrow and cannot accommodate the needle tube.
Gently expand it with a little iron or insert a thread that has been twisted in the Egyptian ointment or the ointment of Sircoon until it expands. Also, if the opening is also wide, stitch both lips together and leave some room so that the syringe can enter without any excess.
And similarly, if the hollow from which pus flows is elevated upwards, cut it in the lowest place where pus flows downwards. Because pus, when blocked in the depression of the contaminant, prevents the wound from healing.
And if you cannot cut the contaminant downwards as desired, then raise the member so that pus flows from it easily according to what is suitable for you. And ensure that no part of the pus gets trapped there.
As for the gauze medications that are placed on the contaminant from outside and how to place them, you should take one of the gauze ointments suitable for what you want, and spread it on a cotton wick. Let the wick be as long as it covers all parts of the contaminant. Then, cut a hole in front of the recess with the scalpel that is slightly larger than the mouth of the recess. Then apply soft poultice on another stick up to the size of the hole and place it upon it while spacing from the mouth of the recess for ease of pus discharge. Do not remove the large stick until after.
A few days later, as for the one on the mouth of the recess, it is the one you remove at each time to allow what has accumulated in pus to come out and know whether what seeps from the scab is much or little, is ripe or not ripe.
And yet, also examine the location of the recess itself; does its owner feel pain there or not, and is there a lump or not. If your treatment progresses like this and you see that only a little material comes out from the mouth of the recess.
Know that the recess may have stuck or is about to stick, so you should remove it from tomorrow or on the third day and when the wound has healed, replace the hole with another one and renew the poultice. If pus came out of the recess after a long time, do not despair of its sticking again.
He will heal soon because some people take a long time for their wounds to heal and others do not. If pus came out of the recess after many days, and it was not ripe, know that the recess has not stuck; if the sticking of the recess is delayed.
If his treatment prolongs, increase in drying out the medicines; let them be of substances that are wet by nature and dried ones like camphorated mastic gum when it has been increased with additional quantity of myrrh. One of the most effective things for treating is to take camphorated mastic gum.
It is replaced by applying rhubarb and pouring on it a moderate aged vinegar, then mixing it with it and using it. If the honeycombed wax medicine has not been cooked until it fattens, or if one takes from honey, patience and cardamom, crushes all of them together, and leaves it to settle upon the honey while it is on fire. Then it is painted over a scratch and tightened on the hidden part or it is painted with the honey that has been cooked until it fattens, and then medicines are applied to it, followed by placing the scratch over it and tightening.
And in such cases, long warts and the head of the rose apple tree, as well as buckwheat flour and germander might be used separately or ground together, filtered and then applied onto the cooked honey. If the wart does not heal with this treatment, it means that there is corruption within.
And it affects the bones or other hard nerves or ligaments; one should apply treatment with Nacor as mentioned before.
The ninety-eighth chapter.
In treating the infected boil, the pierced horn, amputation of the extra finger, and division of interdigital joints.
The boil is flesh that grows abundantly under the thumb nail of the hand or foot, and it may grow in other fingers as well. If its condition worsens and its treatment is neglected, it inflames and becomes very hot.
Or it decays and eats away the root of the horn, possibly even the entire horn. It might extend to the bone causing a stenchy smell and making the end of the finger wide with its color turning dark red. If you treated it using what we mentioned in this section and your treatment was not effective.
In order to do this, one must cut all the ingrowing flesh from the spur with iron then close the wound afterwards. Cutting in this manner is highly effective; however, if the bone is healthy and the spur is also healthy.
The claw part of the spur had pressed into the flesh, causing it to rot and become discolored. It is necessary to place a fine suture under the clawing edge of the spur that presses on the flesh, lift it upwards, and cut that flesh gently.
Apply the strongest burned medicines to what is left of the flesh until it all disappears. Then treat it with ointments until it heals completely. If decay has affected the bone, you should cut that bone out. There will be no healing as long as there is rotten bone in the location.
If I see decay and rot spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of its joints as previously described, then treat it until it heals. If the spur gets hit or grazed causing intense pain, you should first remove any pus present.
Then cut the spur with a sharp surgical tool in a curve from above to below, making sure not to cut into the flesh underneath the spur. This will cause intense pain and pus, which leads to extra growth of flesh at that spot. Then treat the area with remedies to alleviate pain.
As for the extra finger that is born in some people's hands, it could be entirely made of flesh. Or there might be bones in it, and possibly a spur as well. It may have growths at the base of joints on some fingers.
It could be that her growths occur in some of the finger joints, and those growing within certain joints do not move. Those growing near the joint of a finger may move or not. If it is entirely made of flesh, you only cut it off at its base with a wide surgical tool; this makes removal easier.
And if it grows from the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult and involves cutting it off. But if it sprouts within one of the joints' fingers, it should be first cut off its flesh in strips extending to the bone, then spread out the bone with any of those applicators that correspond with this task.
And then he heals it until it is cleansed. As for the adhesion that causes some fingers to touch each other, it often occurs and is something that humans create, which can occur at the end of a cut or burn, among similar things; hence, it may be necessary to sever this adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape, then place a strip or incision in ointment between them. This is done with rose oil so that it does not heal quickly and separate again between them or cause one of them to be placed on the other with a thin sheet of lead until the area heals as necessary.
Similarly, if there is adhesion among some fingers of the hand, cut that adhesion according to what becomes suitable and forms the appearance of the limb.
The ninety-first section.
In cutting the fallopian tubes.
The fallopian tubes are flexible, somewhat thick veins filled with dark blood that occur in most body parts and are especially common in the legs. They often appear in places like the femoral artery, popliteal fossa, and gastrocnemius muscles. It is advisable to first use a strong purging of the body from black matter several times.
Then, slice off the gallbladder. If treating with iron, it is done in two ways: one involves cutting and removing the black blood along with its appearance, while the other entails sweating out the sweat completely. When slicing, the leg should first be soaked in hot water for a good time.
Until the thick, turbid blood clears, then pull the leg of the patient from above his thigh to below his knee with a cloth. Then make cuts in one place or two places or three wide cuts on his body.
Then, using your hand, remove the black blood from the bottom of the leg to the top and then from the top down until you have removed as much dark blood as you consider sufficient or can bear by the strength of the patient. Then bandage him and command him to avoid food that causes the black wind (most likely referring to gas-producing foods), and the process of reappearance and venting is repeated.
When the veins have filled and this harms the patient, but if he sweats, it is characterized by having his leg shaved if there is much hair. Then he will bathe in the bathhouse and dip his legs in hot water until they turn red or he engages in vigorous sports to sweat.
If he does not take a bath until the member heats up, then make cuts in the skin against the sweat in one length either at the end near the knee or at the bottom near the heel. Then cut open with slits and remove the sweat from all sides until it becomes visible to touch.
When it appears, you see that it is red and inflamed. Once the skin is removed, you will also see that it resembles a tendon. Then immerse it in water until it rises above the skin and hang it with a dark smooth peg until another cut near this one is made with three fingers width apart.
Then remove the skin over the sweat until it appears. Lift and hang it as you did before, using a different smooth peg to hang it again. If needed, make another cut or many cuts like that.
Then cleanse it and cut him at the end of the incision in the heel, then pull and clean until it comes out from the second incision. Then pull towards the incision above and do this until you pull it from the third incision from all cuts when they are all out; then cut it.
If the attraction and cleaning does not work, introduce a strong two-strand thread needle and tie it. Pull on it until you pull out any pus with your hand in every direction until it comes out; make sure that it doesn't break. If it breaks, its removal will significantly complicate your surgery.
And for the victim, he will pass a catheter into him, if you have passed it completely, then place cotton that is soaked in a mixture of wine and oil or oil on the wound site, and treat him until he recovers. If the fistula is convoluted with channels that curve towards various directions.
And if it's not straight as we said, it should be cut on each of its curves and areas where they are raised. Then attach it to the catheters so you can pass them all together through it, when cutting it ensure that you don't cut or hurt it because it will make passing your catheter very difficult, so exercise caution.
Image of the channel through which the fistula is incised.
Image of the blind alleyway:.
It should not have an insulation like all other catheters, nor should its end be sharp so as not to cut the skin and become tightly bent but smooth, because if it is thin, it will tear the skin due to its sharpness. However, it has a slight thickness advantage as we mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-Nine and Five.
In treating the civilian's sweat.
This sweat is produced in the calves in hot countries like Hejaz and Arab countries, as well as in other fertile areas of hot lands with little sweating. It might also be produced elsewhere on the body besides the calves due to an infection that occurs under the skin.
This sweat can also occur within living bodies, such as insects and maggots, in the folds of the skin and between flesh. A sign that this type of sweat is beginning to appear is a severe shininess on the legs, followed by an area becoming moist, then sweating starts to emerge from the area where it becomes moist.
It's as if it were a plant or an animal. If one of its parts appears, it should be that a small piece of lead weighing one or two dirhams is wrapped around it and then left hanging from the leg.
Each time something comes out externally, wrap it in lead and secure it. If the process lasts for a long time, cut off some of it and wrap the rest; do not cut it from its origin before all of it emerges because if you cut it, it will shrink and enter the flesh causing pus and infection in the area, resulting in a bad wound.
For this reason, it should be gently drawn out and pulled a little at a time until it comes out of its last part, leaving nothing in the body. Some people might have this sweat emerge over a length of five or ten cubits.
I have heard that one man excreted twenty cubits of it. If you interrupt the treatment for a while, insert a wire into its opening and gently pull it out along with the body until all the contents inside are extracted. Try to treat the area with medicines for several days afterwards.
Then he treated him with tumor remedies, and this blood has many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of the leg or within the leg itself. It creates many mouths and each mouth produces a branch as we mentioned in the division and what was advanced.
The Second Chapter, Ninety.
In the crack of the worm that breeds under the testicle, it is called the cow's cause.
This disease is called "the cow's cause" in some of our countries because it is often found in cows. It refers to a small worm that breeds between the skin and the flesh, which moves throughout the whole body both upwards and downwards.
The itch is felt upon scratching from one part of the body to another until it breaches where it did not penetrate in a spot on the skin, and it comes out. It forms through infection by various mixtures as it occurs with worms, blisters, and flea bites in the stomach,.
It is expected of its harm that when it moves inside the body and rises to the head, reaches the eye, possibly opens within it and exits causing blindness. This happens frequently. If you want to treat it and remove it, this occurs upon scratching and feeling the itch.
You should tie what is above and below it with a tight bandage, then cut her on the surface and remove her. If she has reached into the flesh and you can't find her, apply heat to that spot with fire until it burns, and expect the greatest damage to the eye as we said.
If you see that she has become near the eye in the head, tie under her on the forehead with a tight bandage. Then cut and remove her. It is necessary for those who have experienced it to cleanse their bodies with medications that facilitate the elimination of bad contaminated mixtures and avoid food that causes infection.
Chapter 39
In the incision for the disease known as nafur.
This disease, which in our country is called nafur, is a pain that manifests in some organs then moves from one organ to another. I have seen it as I am describing to you.
I was called to attend a pregnant woman in some oases. I uncovered her arm and felt a slight inflation beneath the skin of her elbow's muscle. An hour later, I saw this inflation moving with the wrist like a worm climbs up its head as fast as lead can move.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain leaves that area and stays in the wrist. Then after an hour, it travels throughout her whole body until it reaches the other arm. She told me that her entire body rotates like what I saw.
I was amazed by the speed of its movement from one organ to another. Before, I had not seen this disease in such a way with such characteristics. Only when a group experienced pain moving from one organ to another did I see it visually as clearly as in this woman.
I could not attribute this to any other reason than that the woman being from desert people, who have dry bodies and exposed skin. That is why this moving wind appeared for the sense of pain, and it should not manifest in those who are affluent and have their skins hidden with moisture.
If you want to treat it and the patient feels pain, it will appear to you clearly as we have described. Secure him above and below with the wheel and make an incision until that enclosed wind comes out and cleans the area.
If you do not see it with your eyes, apply it through purging the body and what repels winds and disperses them, like the pus of pustules and the pus of boils, as well as similar medicines.

In removing arrows.
Arrows can vary depending on their types and the locations in which they are found within the body. As for their variations according to type, some are large and others are small; some are glassed with hollow cores and others have solid ones. Some arrows have three angles and others have four angles.
There are also arrows that have tongues and others with fragments. As for those that occur according to the body parts they are in, there are two types: either the organs are major principal organs like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, stomach, bladder, and so on. If an arrow were to hit one of these organs and if the signs of death that I'm describing to you later should appear, it would be advisable not to remove this arrow from there; for death usually overtakes its owner in most cases. And if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has penetrated into a part of the organ rather than being buried deeply within it, remove it and treat the wound. As for symptoms of the brain if hit by an arrow and piercing bone and injuring the ventricle above the brain, one is exposed to severe headache, confusion, and dizziness.
And if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has penetrated into a part of the organ rather than being buried deeply within it, remove it and treat the wound. As for symptoms of the brain if hit by an arrow and piercing bone and injuring the ventricle above the brain, one is exposed to severe headache, confusion, and dizziness. And redness in the eyes and on the tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, vomiting once or perhaps more times, blood may come out of the nostrils or ears. Speech might be lost, sound goes away, white moisture resembling dough comes out from the wound's site, and there flows a liquid like meat juice.
If these signs appear to you, refrain from treating the injured person and removing the arrow if it has not been removed already. If there are signs of the arrow piercing the heart and it is close to the left rib and feels like it's embedded in a solid thing rather than an empty space.
Perhaps the arrow might exhibit a movement akin to the heartbeat, causing black blood to flow from the wound. Following this, limbs will become weak and cold sweat will appear; recognize that death is imminent in such cases. If the arrow wounds the lung, note that pungent blood will seep out of the wound.
The veins near the neck may swell, and the injured person's skin might change color. They will breathe with an elevated sound and seek to inhale cold air. If the arrow hits the pleura in the chest, it is usually close to the smaller ribs, causing a heavy breathing accompanied by intense pain.
He will gasp and all the muscles in his limbs move. If the arrow hits the liver, it is followed by intense pain and blood that resembles liver color comes out of the wound. If the arrow hits the stomach, perhaps food-like substance not completely digested might come out from the wound.
It is evident, if the arrow hits the abdomen and inflammation begins, with feces-like substance coming out of the wound or ulcer, there's no hope for treatment nor for removing the arrow. If the arrow hit the bladder, and urine starts to come out, there's also no hope for recovery.
Something protruded outward and the pain intensified in the injured person. Know that they are dying. As for other body parts like the face, eyes, neck, shoulders, back, spine, thighs, legs, and similar parts of the body, these have received the greatest damage.
When the arrow missed a vessel or nerve, and was not poisoned, I will tell you about some incidents involving these arrows to guide your treatment. This refers to an incident where an arrow hit a man in his eye socket at the root of his nose.
He removed it for him from the other side under the earlobe and he was clean, nothing harmful happened to his eye. He took out another arrow which had hit a Jew in the lower eyelid's fatty pad. The arrow had disappeared inside but only left the small tip that sticks into wood.
The arrow was large, a composite spear of squared iron that was smooth and had no eyes. The Jew was clean, nothing bad happened to his eye. I removed another arrow from the neck of a Samaritan man. The arrow was Arabic.
The one who had two eyes, I made a cut between his armpits and he had pierced through his neck; it softened until I was able to remove him. The Samaritan recovered and was clean. I removed another arrow for a man who hit him in the belly. We estimated that he would die from it.
And when it remained for about thirty days or a bit more, and there was no change in his condition, I made an incision on the arrow and turned it around before taking it out, and he recovered without any harm happening to him. And then I saw a man who had been hit by an arrow in his back, so the wound stuck to him.
And after seven years, the arrow came out from his heel root. I saw a woman who was hit in her abdomen by an arrow and the wound stuck to her; the arrow remained there without any change in her condition or did not cause trouble for her at all during her natural actions.
I have seen another man struck in the face with an arrow and the wound healed, leaving him not much pain. There are many like this, and I removed an arrow from a man who was one of the Sultan's commanders who had been hit in the center of his nose leaning slightly towards the right side.
The arrow completely left, and I was called to treat it after the fall of the arrow for three days. I found the arrow wound very narrow, so I probed it with a delicate probe, and did not feel it. He felt a thread and pain under his ear from the right opening.
I concluded that the thread was from the side of the arrow, so I bandaged the area with a dressing containing a strong attraction and moisture hoping it would swell, show a sign of the arrow. I pricked him gently, but there were no unusual events at the site indicating that the arrow had reached the location.
I continued to bandage him for many days without any incident, the wound healed inside that wound and it was impossible to remove it for a long time until one day I felt the arrow inside his nose. He informed me of this, so I applied strong medicine on the wound for many days.
Until it opened and I drilled through the wound, feeling the thin tip of the arrow stuck in the wood. Then, I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medicine until we could clearly see the end of the arrow, which had been following me for months, approximately four months.
Then, as the wound widened and I could introduce a hook inside it to pull on him, he did not respond to leaving. Therefore, I kept soothing him and adapting my position with various machines until one day I had a tight hook inserted into him as depicted in the last page of this chapter.
And the physicians would rule that the nasal cartilage does not subside, so they made it protrude and healed the wound completely without harming him in any way. I am telling you about a method to remove some arrows as an example and proof of what I have not mentioned before.
And because the parts of this trade and their detail cannot be understood through description, nor does a book encompass it; rather, the skilled craftsman measures by little on much and with what he has before him he anticipates what is missing and draws upon new work and a new machine when faced with strange situations.
If I were to descend into this trade, I would say that arrows only emerge from the organs in which they have taken root in two ways: either by being drawn out of the place it entered from or from against the other side, and the arrow emerges from where it entered.
Either the arrow is protruding from a fleshly place, in which case it will be drawn out when its time for removal has come. If it does not come out at that time, you should let it remain until the surrounding flesh decays which makes it easier to extract. This applies as well if it's lodged in bone.
If it does not come out when you try to remove it, leave it alone for a few days and then attempt again with pulling and movement every day. It will eventually emerge. If after some time it still hasn't come out, you should pierce around the arrow from all sides on the same bone using small holes until they expand enough for the arrow to pass through. Then pull it out.
If the arrow has penetrated into a bone of the head and gotten to one of the cavities in the brain, and you have seen some of those symptoms that I mentioned to you emerging from behind the wound, refrain from trying to pull out the arrow and leave it until its condition improves after a few days.
If the situation involves attracting and extracting an arrow, if it is extremely embedded and does not respond to pulling attempts, use the probes around the arrow as described for you. Then treat the area until it heals. If the arrow has hidden inside a part of the body. And if he is insensitive, prick him with a probe; if he feels it, pull him by some tools suitable for pulling. If you can't do it because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow or because there's no bone, nerve, or vein inside.
Cut him until the wound widens and you can grab the arrow to extract it. If he has two ears that he holds them, free the diseased flesh in both of them from all sides using any trick that allows this. Try to free the flesh if you cannot remove the flesh by breaking his ears and make him bleed until it is done.
And when you try to extract the arrow in any place, use your finger with all sorts of movements towards all directions until you remove it. Be as gentle as possible so the arrow doesn't break and make extraction harder for you. If you can't do this due to lack of time.
Leave it for some days until the surrounding flesh becomes rotten, then proceed with extracting again; it becomes easier after that. If you encounter bleeding, use the treatment method we mentioned in its section, and be cautious not to cut any blood vessel or nerve or tendon, apply tricks when necessary.
In every direction you can remove the arrow and do it gently, carefully, with adjustment as described to you. It is necessary that when you draw out the arrow, you should make it resemble the shape it was in upon the impact of the arrow, for this method is better.
If you cannot do this, then use whatever shape is possible. As for the arrow that exits from against another side, it may have protruded something outwards or when touching your skin with care, you might find a tip of the arrow nearby and see it piercing.
Cut it through and make the cut as wide as possible for your fingers to fit. Then pull it, because this makes it easier to exit. If it is stuck in bone, move your hand carefully until the arrow affects the bone and expands itself then pull it.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days until you try again; if the arrow is still there during your attempt, push it with it. If the push stick has fallen and you want to use pushing again, insert the hollow mechanism into the animal's anus so that it enters its gut then push it with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with a tool that enters into that gut; this makes it easier for the arrow to exit. If the arrow was poisoned, it would be best if you could remove all of the poison in the flesh and then treat it accordingly.
If the arrow is in the chest or abdomen or bladder or side and it's close to what you can pierce with the probe, cut and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve then remove it.
Then make the incision and if it needs stitching, then treat it until it heals. Description of the fingers that pull out arrows:.
Its ends resemble the tube of a bird's beak, made like a pliers if it grasps an arrow or something that it does not leave, and various sizes can be made from it, big, small, and medium, all depending on the size of the shaft and its smallness, as well as the width and narrowness of the wound.
The picture of the evacuated cannon:.
The picture of the grooved cannon:.
This is how the groove at the end resembles a bevel, making it easier to enter and push it into the evacuated arrow,.
The 59th chapter.
In the division of veins.
The veins that were usually divided in the body into thirty veins, including twenty-eight cerebral veins, sixteen of which are on the head. The pulsating veins behind the ears known as the two sensory veins. The arteries found within the jawbones, and the two veins located at the back of the eyes known as the two observers or vessels of observation.
And the vein that is in the center of the forehead, the one found on the tip of the nose and nostrils, the two veins located around the neck, and the two veins inside the upper lip. The veins within the lower lip are known as the two salivary glands. And there are two veins beneath the tongue which are also recognized.
As for the veins that branch out in the arm and hand, they are five veins. One of them is the basilic vein which is on the side of the beast (arm) and it's generally called the cerebral and ochreous vein, being the middle vein as it consists of a branch of the basilic and one from the basilic vein. It is generally named body vein.
The basalec which is located on the human side and also known as the brachial plexus, is generally called abdominal sweat and arm cord. It rests on the zygapophysial joint, being attached to it, and manifests itself clearly above the wrist in a visible manner. The axillary region.
And it is the sweat duct located between the hip and knee, which has two streams. In the leg and the foot, there are three sweat ducts; one of them under the kneecap from the animal side and secondly on the inner side where its place is found at the heel in the human side stream, that's the sweat duct for women whose location is behind the anklebone on the animal side.
In the other leg, there are also three such sweat ducts. As for the two sweat ducts behind the ears, they serve in draining chronic discharges, related diseases and headaches, as well as how to drain them according to what I describe.
And that is to shave the head of the patient and scrape behind it in the place of the sweat ducts with a coarse sharp tool until it properly appears, then hang up the patient by his neck with a loop of cloth until the two sweat ducts appear behind the ears in the lower positions on the head. Feel them with your finger and where you feel their pulse under your finger is where you apply the needle.
Then take a surgical saw, known as 'nasil', and insert it under the sweat duct in the skin until the cutting edge reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the duct and skin above you while cutting through them in cuts that are neatly done. The length of these cuts will be approximately two fingers' width.
Or in a similar way, and you send out the amount of blood that you want then tighten them with ligatures and leave them until they heal. The ligation and tying of these were already mentioned at the beginning of this book. As for the two veins located in the axillae, they serve draining for chronic diseases related to the head, severe headaches, constant cold sweats, as well as excessive dribbling that is directed towards the eyes.
How to separate them, as I describe it, ties the man's neck with a sheet until the veins become clearly visible on his skin and you can see their pulse under your index finger. Then he learns by practice, and then lifts the skin from above the veins up over a part of it with your thumb.
The surgeon enters from below, lifts the tendon upwards, treats it in a similar way to the previous tendons and sends blood as needed. Then she releases the man's neck and places her finger on his pulse for measurement.
Then, she places a pad and bandage on him and tightens them from above firmly. She leaves him until he heals. These two procedures - the cutting of tendons and ligatures - were mentioned in my first book. As for separating the forehead tendon, its use comes after separating the neck ligature to address chronic face issues such as acne, ulcers, and dusky redness.
And as I describe how to separate the ligament, it chokes the man by a sheet until the tendon becomes visible. Then she takes what is called the scalpel and this is its depiction:.
You place the blade of the scalpel, which is at the head of the knife, on the same tendon and strike it from above with a comb or something similar in that direction. Then you allow the blood to flow as much as you want. Afterward, she releases the man's neck and tightens him until he heals.
And a wide-bladed scalpel may be used, but it should not have a sharp edge like other scalpels; instead, its tip should be slightly broadened to avoid distortion. It is because the bone is close by; if the blade were too thin, it might break in him.
And the two tendons in the eyelids serve to address diseases of the eye such as scarlet fever, redness, pus, and face disorders. As for how to cut them, you tie the man's neck with a sheet, then separate them while standing on his head, making the cut somewhat long using a small but slightly broad scalpel.
If there is no flesh in the location, then if the incision is thin at its edge, it may break. Then there will be a flow of blood from your need and you place two pieces of cotton on it and tighten them for one night, then release them. As for pus discharging from the nostril, it benefits from severe fever.
And severe headache, and one of the facial diseases like the red measles that appears in the nose, especially if it's chronic. As for how to treat it, have him hold his scrotum with both hands then grasp his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long incision tool.
And pierce him in the middle of the rabbit itself between his nostrils at a straight angle because sweat doesn't exist there, blood comes out from it. You should hold your tool for a while and let the blood flow as much as needed then bind it overnight as it heals quickly.
As for warts, it is beneficial to treat them by constricting breathing and the beginning of syphilis and black diseases that appear on the skin such as the dark pea, boils, bad sores, and swellings. As for treating them, have him hold his scrotum with a band under them while sitting in front of the operator.
The operator is seated on a chair, then open the sweat to its full length with a wide but small incision. Then remove as much blood as needed or according to your need for that, and do similarly with the other sweat gland. Finally release the band.
Squeeze the sweat glands moderately to avoid choking the operator and leave him until tomorrow, as he will recover from his injury. As for the sores of the mouth (phlegm), it is beneficial to treat them after treating the lumps that they help in cavities of the mouth, decay of gum tissue, bad sores, and splits on the lips, and bad sores.
This is a procedure concerning the nose and its surroundings; how to position it so that urine can flow in front of you, then grab his neck with a towel. Then turn his lips and look at the two nostrils you see; one from the right side of the upper lip and the other from the left, distinguishing them by their darkness.
And also, there are two thin black lines near them; cut them with a clean incision. If it worries you and you're unsure what they are, aim for a larger cut and show me, similarly perform this on the two nostrils in the bottom lip.
As for the two veins beneath the tongue, they have a use: cutting them after severing the cheeks of the cleft in the throat from diseases such as dysentery and mouth illnesses, and how to cut them by having the urine stand between your hands with sandals on his feet, lifting his tongue and looking under his tongue for one vein on each side and their color towards blackness.
Cut them carefully and be cautious not to excessively cut them; there are veins under them which may cause bleeding from those veins. As for the three veins that get severed in the neck, they're the ones whose tradition is to sever them in everyone, and doing so has two outcomes.
Either by piercing with a broad or olive-shaped puncture instrument into the socket, or by cutting with a sharp knife, which is called "the slit" [and this is its depiction], the image of the broad olive-shaped puncturing tool:.
It should be as wide as you see to accommodate the thick, boiling blood contained in the swollen, visible glans veins that are filled with heavy blood like honey. This is an image of the olive-shaped puncturing tool:.
This clamp is narrower in size and has finer ends suitable for dividing thin, watery blood-filled veins. This is a picture of the threading clamp.
This is the threading tool suitable for incisions, and there are various types of threads and wires depending on the size of the veins as well as their narrowness. It can be used in place of others, and it is well-known among craftsmen.
As for the basilius, one of these three veins, its advantage in dividing is that it draws blood from the conditions that occur below the neck and throat reaching to the chest and abdomen. When performing an incision, the surgeon should be cautious not to divide the neck area because if there is a vessel beneath it, and he miscalculates causing the clamp to pierce deeper, it could lead to cutting through that artery.
If there is bleeding, that's why it should not divide using a clamp but rather make an incision with the threading tool. If the basilius does not show clearly, it may be better to avoid it and use another or seek help from some of its peers.
Or cut instead of the shoulder cord, which is clear and can be divided with the threading clamp as we said. If you want to divide it in a specific area, before pulling the arm tight, you should determine the pulse point position until you identify the pulsation location and learn it through touch.
Then, tie the arm and make an incision along the vein with a bent threading tool as we said. Make sure to strike the blow away from the position of the artery. When you pull the band during tying, if you notice swelling at the spot you learned through touch, that swelling indicates the presence of an artery; avoid it.
If I see the blood at the incision site gush like that of a boy's urine, and if it is thin red blood, then you should know that it is arterial blood. In this case, proceed and hold your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the blood stops flowing significantly, it often does stop, so tighten the arm.
Leave it, warn the patient not to neglect treatment and keep him restrained until he recovers. Don't let him move for days until he is healed. If blood doesn't stop flowing even after your intervention with no response from the patient, attempt to tie the artery if you can see it; its ends will constrict and stop the bleeding.
Alternatively, take a dogwood bark, split it and take the half part. Tightly tie this around the bleeding site with the bandages for another day. If the blood stops flowing, otherwise treat it according to what has been mentioned earlier regarding applying clamps to stop bleeding, and stopping the blood is not difficult in most cases.
For a small wound, where the bandage remains on the arm, inform him. As for the dark sweat, its use is beneficial in causing it to come from above the head and below the body since it is composed of an artery branch and vein branch as we have said.
It is necessary for the patient to be restrained due to his sweating; there's a nerve under him. If you increase the pressure of the clamp and hit the nerve, it can cause numbness that is difficult to see, and maybe he won't recover at all. This nerve often appears through touch.
If it is hidden in some people and the sweating is thin, not noticeable, then you should make a cut on your sweating with a needle and avoid hitting the nerve as much as possible. If the sweat is between two nerves, split the sweat longitudinally. And regarding the sweat that comes from veins, it's beneficial to have it because it draws blood from the head.
It treats eye diseases and this method is particularly recommended if you wish to elaborate; namely, by inserting an olive pincer or a broad basil pincer. It is the safest of all methods because there is no artery nor nerve under it.
However, when extracting it is necessary to avoid using the pincers just on the muscle head and to seek a soft position. It will not harm him even if he is struck by the first blow and needs extraction multiple times; however, some people may swell if they are not extracted in the first strike.
But that tumor will not harm him in any way. As for the method of extraction and its side effects, as well as what should be done in its repair, firstly, it is necessary to know that extraction can either be used solely for preserving health.
Otherwise, it can be used in diseases. When the extraction is meant for preserving health and its continuity, as well as preventing disease occurrence, then it should be done in one of the three veins found in the appendix - namely, the iliac, hepatic, and femoral veins - preferably at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear.
Extraction can be done on Sunday or Tuesday, after the day has passed three hours. As for extraction in diseases, there is no limited time; it happens whenever need and necessity call for it, whether during the night or day.
Extraction should be performed in every hour and at any time. It is not recommended to extract children until they reach fourteen years of age, nor elderly people who have surpassed sixty years. Extraction should never be done on anyone for whatever reason.
It is necessary to cleanse his stomach before extraction with a gentle injection if there is much retained faeces, so that it does not get caught in the veins during extraction from the digestive tract. An infection could harm the main organs. Extraction should not be performed on those who are bloated or have diarrhea, nor those experiencing constipation until their condition improves.
Warnings also include after defecation, vomiting, diarrhea, over-sexing, tiredness, sports, staying awake and fasting, and everything that weakens physical or mental health. Then you should examine the mixing of these if the blood is thick.
By food, drinks and medicines if possible, then he should take a bath if not prevented by any obstacle or engage in some sports to purify the blood and make his discharge during the day as we explained, and it is good for him that his chest remains free of all bad psychological symptoms during this day.
Such as worries, anger, fear and all other physical symptoms like tiredness, over-exertion, sex and so forth, he should prepare the things that people usually use from various kinds of pleasant scents, fans, entertainments etc. depending on what each person can handle.
Then the patient should sit on a pillow that is higher than the one he sits on when relieving himself. Then, he should stretch out his arm and the surgeon rubs him with his hand two or three times. Next, they pull the belt around the abdomen two or three times, making sure it's not too tight.
Because excessive tightening can either prevent blood flow by obstructing the passage of blood, or by causing too much relaxation it also prevents blood flow. So after tightening, it is necessary to rub all the parts of the patient's body with both hands on each other.
Until the veins swell and can be felt by touch, then the surgeon rubs the patient with old oil in a circular motion. Then he puts his index finger of his left hand under the same vein where he wants to relieve himself slightly so that the vein doesn't slip and avoid the strike. Because there are veins that you find like the umbilical cord which seek refuge in the fistula, and from them is one filled with air. If a clamp is placed on such a vein, it will sink below the clamp and deceive the fistula so it doesn't open; if it does open, it would only be partially open.
Therefore, the fistula should carefully observe these matters, then place the clamp. If it opens the vein on its first attempt, and if not, he should repeat this process slightly below or on top of that position quickly, in case the area becomes swollen.
If the pus or scabs swell or itch, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage; perhaps it attracted a hot infection that doesn't allow bathing. Then repeat the operation if he desires, if he pierced with the clamp and the opening is small, and blood flow is thin.
I feared that the amount of blood you desire may not come out. Reapply the clamp in the same hole, adjust it for straightness and slightly increase the opening. Do this while pressing quickly before the area swells; many people experience swelling when they have a small opening.
If you see that it has swollen, don't worry about it as it won't benefit you. Put something made of the wick of oil on him; this helps blood flow and is better in this place than oil itself or any other unguents; do similarly.
Therefore, use the wick of oil in all fistulas when blood flow is impossible. This can be done by the skilled surgeon and medical attendants; if one places any part of these on the location, blood will thin out and dissolve if it's thick.
If a large lump occurs in the place of the fistula, it happens often, especially for those who have not been treated correctly or had a small opening. In that case, act quickly; apply a sponge soaked in warm water and salt on the lump for an hour, it will dissolve.
It is necessary to do this after the blood has completely drained from its own sweat or from another, if there remains something of darkness or greenness at the site after a few days, it does not harm that; if you wish, you can apply some patience and dissolved soap on it.
Or something of the juice of foding and similar things, often a tumor and nuto appear at the incision site of the appendix, put your hand on it, if you find that it softens when you touch it, then this nuto is bad, beware of applying anything as mentioned.
Perhaps it might bleed from him blood of a vessel, but bind its clot with what is in it until the place gets harden. Then treat it with all treatments till he heals. It's necessary that you get rid of every man's blood according to his strength and what appears in the predominant color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it bleed until it turns red. Similarly, if you see it thick, make it flow until it thins. And even if it's sharp, let its sharpness go. It's necessary for someone who is full and strong, needing to expel all of his blood in one go.
You should widen the incision in the sweat and make it wide, while for someone who is weak it's opposite. It's necessary that he removes it in stages, making the hole narrow. The best thing to use in an incision of the sweat gland is a hollowed out trench without any ridges.
This kind of incision is perfect for bleeding and cutting the nerve, it's Ahmed and Islam among incisions in width and length. When someone tends to it during incision procedures, you should feed him something before the operation like soaked bread in water mixed with garlic juice or sugar syrup.
If it is a blood clot and he has expelled blood three or four times, if the disposition is cold then before the surgery he should eat unleavened bread in a beverage of mead or in a honey drink flavored with saffron or in a refreshing drink made from mint.
If fainting occurs during surgery and its cause is the large amount of blood that escapes, it may be necessary to drink meat water and minty refreshments. Its treatment should include using ginger and massaging his chest with it. It would also be beneficial to use all we mentioned in our section on fainting.
The one who is vomiting, and if someone wants to relieve his arm and calm his blood again, then it should be that the surgeon allows for a little bleeding over several consecutive days for this person, given their large and weak expulsion.
And if someone wants to relieve their arm and calm their blood again with a strong body, they should do this over seven or nine hours of the first surgery. But if someone wants to draw blood from his body towards the opposite direction where it was leaning, he might recover within the second or third day.
And if the body contains a large amount of blood that has heated and swollen, causing fever, it may be necessary to extract all of the blood in one burst and remove a large quantity. Expand the opening until you observe fainting after checking all conditions for surgery. And place your hand on their pulse when blood is flowing continuously, to prevent death taking place instead of fainting; this occurs often due to the surgeon's unawareness and lack of attention. It should not be done if you wish to relieve their arm and calm their blood again.
And the sweat's mouth has been sealed, making blood expulsion difficult to the extent that it becomes intensely blocked. Either you should leave it until a second decomposition occurs or else tilt with a scalpel what is congealed in the sweat's mouth.
Or you could apply to it something that has dissolved in water, or apply some of the strong vinegar or shakznaia, and gently compress it until the blood comes out. If the sweat had swollen, leave it alone.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If necessity calls for a second bloodletting, there's no choice but either to decompose it above that spot or else decompose it elsewhere on the arm or sweat gland.
As for the arm cord, if alkhal and basliq are not found or are hidden as it is composed of them, here's how to decompose it: have the patient dip his hand in hot water until the thread turns red and the sweat appears visibly. Then pull gently with the bandage, applying moderate tension.
Then decompose the sweat gland in a slight deviation, neither in width nor length. Make the opening wide and have your decomposition above the elbow joint. If blood doesn't come out, place the hand back in the hot water basin and let the blood flow into the water.
Continue until you meet your requirement. During summer days, you might not need to repeat dipping the hand in hot water as it works better during winter times for blood flow into heated water. This sweat gland is safer compared to all other glands. And because it doesn't have a harmful sweat gland or nerve underneath, as for decomposing the bile duct from your right hand, it benefits in liver conditions. Here's how to decompose it: hold your wrist with the bandage or with your hand after dipping it into hot water until the sweat becomes swollen.
And because it doesn't have a harmful sweat gland or nerve underneath, as for decomposing the bile duct from your right hand, it benefits in liver conditions. Here's how to decompose it: hold your wrist with the bandage or with your hand after dipping it into hot water until the sweat becomes swollen. It is revealed by touch very well then it becomes detailed on a slight alteration, and if it cuts off everything of it, it does not harm him in any way. Preserve, do not insist with the forceps because under it there is the nerve of fingers and the location is free from flesh, then bring back your hand to hot water.
And let the blood flow in it, for if you do not warm it up in hot water, the blood will solidify in the sweat gland and prevent it from flowing. When you remove as much blood as needed, apply butter and salt to the wound so that it does not heal quickly.
In the same way, you should do this for every narrow part. If it is useful to perform the operation on the left hand, then it can help with conditions related to the gallbladder just as when it comes to performing a similar operation on another limb. It's useful similarly if it helps in removing issues that are located below the body such as female reproductive organs diseases.
Retention of urine and kidney diseases, chronic leg ulcers and similar ailments, and how to perform an operation where a man should dip his leg in hot water and apply massage until the sweat appears. Then pull upwards on the ankle joint, with the foot towards the thumb area at the heel.
It branches out in the face of a man into many branches. Operate on the widest branch from these or at the ankle where they meet; this is better and more acceptable. If you operate on the face of the man, be cautious about the nerves under it.
Make your operation for removal as if you are about to cut him, and let the forceps be slightly open. If blood doesn't come out immediately, have him dip his leg in hot water and let the blood flow until it drains completely. If the surgeon mistakes the sweat gland with the operation on the first attempt.
Let return to the incision a little upwards, because the position is safe and it does not fear danger if you watch over the nerve as we said, similarly when dealing with other parts of the woman's body. As for the women's sweat, its place is as we said at the heel from the beast side.
And the benefit of making an incision near the knee pain if that comes from hot blood, and how to make this incision by introducing the camel's urine and hastening it and pulling his leg from the knee up to the heel with four fingers using a thin long surgical glove; one can't see anything except in this way.
And when it appears, then make the incision in any condition. You may either leave it on a deviation which is better or cut and remove it or cut it with a cut. Its position is safe, and it is very hidden for most people if you don't find it.
And if there's no clear sensation, then make an incision in some of its parts, which appears on the back of the foot towards the thigh and the shinbone, and be careful about the nerves, and send out as much blood as you want.
Then apply the stitch, place cotton at the incision site, and tighten the area; it will heal quickly.
The sixtieth and ninth section.
In bloodletting and how to use it.
The vials for bloodletting could be made of glass, wood, copper or crystal. Bloodletting occurs in two ways: one is bloodletting with the needle and removal of blood, and the other is bloodletting without using a needle.
And this type of bloodletting without using a needle also has two aspects.
Hammer chafers for the tendons, they are both pages of the neck on both sides. Knee hammer is under the lower jaw in the mouth. Shoulder blade hammer and wrist hammer on the donkey's hoof, elbow hammer which is in the middle of the arms, thigh hammer, and hamstring hammer.
Suction, it only draws blood from the small veins spread in the flesh. Therefore, it should not be completely lost like removing a limb and it is not advisable to use suction whether with or without fire for any disease that results from congestion until the body is completely drained.
If necessity calls for suction due to a disease or custom, we used it at all times in the beginning and end of each month and in the middle and at any time.
And it is that some people, when there's too much blood in their bodies, need to remove it through suction and they find heaviness on their heads and headaches. Some of them see congestion, redness, or swelling on their face, head, and neck. Others notice a rash on their faces and ears. They might also have darkness and whiteness in their eyes. And some of them experience pain at the site for the suction procedure.
Among them, some laugh excessively and find the taste of blood in their mouths; they spit it out and bleed. Some sleep more than usual, dreaming about blood, redness, wounds, and surgeries among other things. If we see any sign of this kind,
And especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we would perform bloodletting upon us after two or three hours have passed from noon, and as for the benefit of puncturing bloodletting, it relieves heaviness in the head and water that collects between the eyes.
But it should be after exhausting the body's fluids. This bloodletting can replace bloodletting through the scrotum, and precautions must be taken not to use it on those with cold brains or experiencing congestion; for it would severely harm them.
So it should not be used by the elderly, nor by those who have cold conditions in their head; they may experience memory loss as a result of overusing it.
So, it is advisable for the surgeon to have his hand slightly lower when applying pressure during bloodletting, in fear of causing memory loss. As for the bloodletting on the neck, it substitutes bloodletting through the earlobe and the nape.
So it relieves bronchial asthma, tightness in breathing, chest pain, coughing and congestion, and the bloodletting on the neck should be slightly raised because if directed downwards, it would weaken the heart and the stomach.
And as for bloodletting on the temples, it relieves sudden pains in the head, headaches, dizziness, and throat tightness, as well as toothache, substituting for bloodletting through the nape. It is advisable to instruct surgeons not to deepen their hand with the lever, lest they cut a vein causing excessive bleeding.
And as for bloodletting under the chin, it relieves swelling in the mouth and gum diseases and similar illnesses that occur in the mouth; it can replace bloodletting through the lips. As for shoulder bloodletting, it relieves pleurisy caused by congestion and heat.
If it is catgut of the abdominal cavity and zygastric ligaments, it helps with what benefits three major basilar veins, hepatic ducts and common bile duct because it attracts blood from all those capillary vessels present in the flesh and attracts these vessels from others that are thicker than them until the attraction reaches the three major thick vessels.
It is necessary that you command the surgeon not to focus on the condition because it is open to flesh and below are nerves and arteries. As for the menstruating person who performs bloodletting on the wrist, she benefits from bedsores and sores in the lower areas.
It is necessary to command the surgeon that the person performing bloodletting should be large and made of copper because this position requires a strong tool, perhaps it may break a glass cupped utensil, and many conditions are set. As for calf bloodletters, their cups lack significantly.
Because it attracts blood from the entire body and relieves chronic pain in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, promotes urine production, treats warts and boils, replaces bleeding in the ileum and mesentery, although it heavily strains the body and causes confusion in most people. Cups for the iliac vessels are closely similar to the benefits of calf bloodletting.
The method of applying the cups is as follows: Initially, you put an empty cup and wet its siphon moderately. Don't leave the cups on for long but place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the fluids mix evenly with the area to which they are applied at a flat angle. Continue this process until you see the area turn red and open up.
The blood turns red, and then you would let out a little more slowly and continue letting it out until you observe the condition of the bodies. If someone is thin with loose flesh and has porous pores, it's necessary to let them bleed once only so that the area doesn't get irritated.
The section of the text instructs the barber surgeon to slightly widen and deepen the cut, adjusting it gently with a delicate movement. If there is thick blood within, it should be cut twice; however, in the first cut, he should open up a pathway for the flowing and evaporating of the blood, and during the second cut, refrain from searching to expel the thick, boiling blood.
If the blood is extremely thick, he would repeat the cut for a third time to achieve the goal. In essence, if we wish to remove a little blood, we only need one incision; if we want to remove much blood, we make multiple cuts; and if we determine that the blood is viscous, accordingly, we adjust the depth of our cut.
It may be necessary to make a deep cut, with the moderate depth of the cut being only down to the skin's depth. You should not use excess heat during the operation, nor water or any other precautions that are advised for those performing the operation. However, if one has thick, hard, bumpy skin with narrow pores.
It may be necessary to apply lubricating, cooling ointments at the places of the dressings; however, during summer time, one can use oils such as almond oil, pomegranate oil, sweet walnut oil or sesame seed oil.
And if it is winter, use oils such as neroli oil, sesame seed oil, chamomile oil, or onion and similar ones. If the pus is thick and cold, then use oils like turpentine oil, almond bark oil, pine oil, or dill oil among others.
If the person performing the operation has large pores and the skin is very oily, it may be advisable to avoid oiling. Those with very oily blood should wash their dressings after the operation with rose water or cold water or pomegranate leaf water or onion juice among others. For those whose blood is abundantly moist.
The chapter instructs on the cleansing of surgical instruments. They should be washed with vinegar or water mixed with asafoetida and similar substances. If the material is particularly dense, it should be washed with old wine or water mixed with mastic, or a decoction from resins or borage, and so forth. It is advisable to exercise caution when using bloodletting in hot baths or immediately after bathing.
It is advisable to use it one or two hours after leaving the bath. It is not good for anyone to sleep immediately after bloodletting. The person who gives and receives bloodletting should refrain from certain things before and after the procedure.
Firstly, you should consider if the person giving or receiving bloodletting is of the thin and hot-blooded type prone to inflammation. If so, they should take cooling remedies like poppy seeds, spinach, cress, basil, and such, making their food consist mostly of salads. They should eat goat meat as a cure for inflammation and similar issues.
And if someone has a cooler temperament, they should be given honey water or the water of myrtle shrubs and cress, as well as medium-aged grape juice that is between old wine and new. They are advised to limit their food intake and make their diet mostly salads like cucumbers, pigeons, canaries, and chicken egg whites (afida bagats). Drinking more than eating should be the case for the day of bloodletting and fasting.
Sometimes, it may be advisable for some people to drink the famous rue tea or myrrh medicine or shilatha before bloodletting and fasting, both before and after it, to strengthen the main organs and purify the blood. It is not recommended for those who let their hair out to drink them.
As for the gauzes that are not hung, these are the gauzes placed on the liver, gallbladder, breasts and on the stomach and the navel, and on kidney positions, and in the area of the hip because these organs cannot bear to be hung. Rather, they mean either drawing blood from one organ to another.
Placing the fumigator on the breasts for reasons related to cold or using it to cure an inflamed organ with a cold wind that has burnt the organ. Similarly, placing the fumigator on the abdomen and groin allows the organ to move, warm up, and alleviate pain through this cold breeze.
And it can be placed on the kidneys if there is a blockage or stone in them, as by its strength, maybe it could open the blockage or remove the stone from its place. Similarly, when used on the liver and gallbladder with a wind that gets mixed in both, these fumigators work fine without any moisture just by air.
It can also be used with fire and can be filled with steam for purposes of fumigation. This is because when the fumigator is filled, let it be large with hot water alone or with water that has been boiled with some herbs suitable for this purpose.
Then it is filled and placed on the area, held for some time and then removed. This process may be repeated as required. Here's an image of the fumigator used with fire:.
Its mouth opening would be like two fingers when it is as shown, and its depth would be about half a foot. It has a small hole on one side approximately halfway along the length, where an awl can be inserted; this is made of Chinese brass or yellow brass with thick edges.
It is flat and rounded to avoid injuring the organ when it is placed on it. It has a small obstruction made of brass or iron in its center where the candle is set on fire, as this fumigator can be larger than described depending on the conditions, or smaller for specific illnesses.
And we will use it; the fumigators for boys and young women are not suitable for men and cattle. As for how to place this fumigator with fire on the organ, you light a wick made of fine cotton or a small candle from charcoal, and then put it on the hardened penis rod in the middle of the fumigator.
To have the fire ascend from below towards the amputation area, so as not to burn the deceased's body, then place on the limb and finger at the hole we mentioned until when we grasp the amputation tool, we do not need to remove the finger.
The steam escapes through that hole and the amputation tool settles on the mark. Then, ignite the wick on this surface and reheat it if necessary for this purpose. As for the amputation tool used in leprosy with water, there is no solid rod or hole in it.
It should only be used by filling it with water and placing it on the limb alone, here is its image:.
This amputation tool, the larger it was able to hold much water, the better it was.
The seventy-ninth chapter of the seventh section.
In discussing the hanging point.
The hanging point is only used in most cases for organs where it's not possible to use the amputation tools either because they are small like lips and gums etc., or because the limb is exposed like fingers, nose etc.
And how to use it, which refers to the hanging point that is in pure water free from contaminants. Then leave it for a day and night in the pure water until it dries up, so that nothing remains inside its cavity. Then, the body is first drained by bleeding or incision, then the limb is wiped clean.
Until it reddens, then it is placed on the limb; if filling occurs, it falls off. If it's possible to apply pressure with an amputation tool, this provides greater benefit; otherwise, wash the area with soap and abundant water, then apply it, squeeze it. If bleeding continues after the hanging point falls off and it was a splashing blood, then wet a cotton swab in cold water and use it.
Place it from above until the bleeding stops, if there is a lot of blood apply a powder or a paste or something similar from the herbs until the bleeding stops. Or place on the spot half of the processed and ground eggplant.
Leave it until the eggplant sticks in place; then the bleeding will stop. If you need to reapply the treatment, do not use that wax if another is available. If this wax does not stick, gently apply the spot with thin fresh blood.
Or pierce the spot with a needle until some blood comes out, then place it. If she feels something of blood when pierced, it sticks to its place; if you want it to come off, sprinkle it with something like patience or salt or ashes and it will fall off from its place.
The third chapter.
In Algebra.
This chapter also serves as one of the tools needed in medicine, which is algebra and the resolution of fractures and their healing.
Know, my children, that this chapter may be misused by ignorant doctors and the common people. Those who never glanced through old books or even read a single letter from them.
And for this reason, this art of knowledge in our country has become extinct. I have never encountered a single person who truly mastered it. And what I have benefited from it, is what I have gained through the length of my reading of the early books and my insistence on understanding them until I extracted knowledge from them. Then, I stuck to experimentation and practice throughout my life.
And I have drawn for you in this chapter all that encompasses my knowledge about it. My experience progressed after I brought it to you, freed it from the excess of elongation, reduced it to its most concise form and clearly explained it. I depicted numerous images of the machines that are utilized within it for you.
This is an increase in explanation as I did in the preceding two chapters, and there is no strength except with God the Almighty.
The first chapter.
In this first chapter, we will omit the details of performing bone fracture healing. It's necessary to present them and before we start describing each broken or dislocated body part one by one, it is advisable to introduce some general points and sections in this chapter. Firstly, it forces you to understand and grasp the truth about this matter, both you personally, and anyone who is eager to learn this noble craft.
I say that if anyone ever experiences a fracture, dislocation or laceration or fall, you should first hurry to correct or relieve them, or both. If prevented by something like weakness of strength, or if it happened to a young child or an old person requiring both treatments at the same time, or if the circumstances are extremely hot or cold weather.
Then in his diet, he restricts to cold legumes, bird meat, and lentils, and forbids drinking water and dense meats, as well as foods that fill the stomach up with blood until the tumor subsides and you do not expect material to accumulate at the site.
Then, when the time comes to resume his usual precautions, if he takes fractured bones in setting, it should be that the ill person eats foods rich in nutrition that are thick and starchy, containing a stickiness similar to porridge, rice, lentils, bulgur wheat, meatballs, and ground beef. And eggs, fish, thick liquids and things similar. Through this practice the binding of fractures becomes quicker and more effective. Understand that broken bones in the vigorous men and aged persons cannot ever naturally connect and heal to their original nature again.
To dry their bones due to their firmness, what was once extremely soft in the bones of young children might connect and heal, but nature grows on the broken bone from all directions like tar. There is a sort of stickiness that adheres to it and tightens until some parts adhere to each other.
And some parts adhere to each other until it reaches the same strength and solidity as before, so nothing can hinder his actions.
For this reason, the food for the patient should contain foods that are strong, sticky and tough, as we have explained. And be aware that fractures can vary in type depending on the body part; a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the rib is different from a fracture of the back.
Similarly, all other body parts differ from each other. We will delve into the description of each type of fracture specifically in its own section, where we'll detail it separately from others. The type of bone fracture can also vary within itself.
Because it could be a fracture without the formation of fragments, or it could be a longitudinal break in the bone with fragments and clean and unclean protrusions. The fracture can also occur along with a wound and penetration into the skin. It could also be a slight concussion.
And for each type, there's a specific method in restoring it as detailed separately. Through this, one can recognize the deformity of bone fractures - their swelling, appearance and sensation when tapping them with your hand.
When there is no protrusion visible, no discomfort or sensitivity in your bone tissue, and you don't find many reasons for pain, it means that there isn't a fracture. It could be a mild bruise, a gentle break, or a slight concussion. There's no need to agitate or move it significantly.
But carry it with the medications that will be mentioned later when they agree with the situation, then gently tighten him, and remember that if bone fractures or collapses between two without causing pieces to fall apart except that each part has left its owner.
You should promptly correct and adjust it when needed before a hot tumor occurs. If a hot tumor does occur, leave it for days until the hot tumor subsides, then reshape it in any gentle way you can manage.
And remember, correcting and adjusting a broken bone is easier than dealing with one that has pieces. Then apply what will be mentioned later. If the bone contains pieces, it's necessary to extend the injured limb from both sides whether by hand or foot.
Either use your hands if the limb is small, or use two ropes, and possibly with a rope and hand. Keep your broken limb in a flat position like its natural shape until the fractured bone extends partially; then correct those excesses back to their places through every possible means of trickery and gentleness.
And strive to ensure that your actions do not cause pain or discomfort to those in pain. Make an effort to unite each bone with its companion in the best way possible. In this time, touch and feel them with your hands. If you see anything contrary to their original state, correct it and adjust them as much as your ability allows.
He warned of extreme stress and powerful poking, as many fools do, often narrating their actions; they throw a hot thing or for a moment into the member, which I have seen them doing repeatedly.
Then he insisted on settling, mastering and exerting that member in peace and patience. He warned the patient not to move it during his wakefulness and sleep, when he turns and is agitated, at the time of defecation and all its movements, which are enough for him. And he should seek that the position of the member is comfortable with it, ensuring relief from pain.
That is, if he feels pain or discomfort in his position of the member, that it should be moved to another position where there's no sensation of pain, and he should ensure that this position is even and straight.
So that no deformity occurs in the member if it is forced. As for how to pull on a broken member, I describe as you have asked me. Know that broken members vary in size and shape; there are some like the arm, fingers, penis etc., which differ from each other in terms of size and structure.
The bandages for the puncture wounds should be soft and not rough, whereas those on harder parts like the thigh, back, and chest should have firm layers as the wide ligament binds the large member from all sides with equal tension without causing interference.
Then, after you have finished settling (the wound or limb), you should begin to carry the appropriate plaster. In gentle pressure on the break site, then start winding the bandage on the break site itself. It should be three or four turns depending on what part of the body it is and gently pull on the bandage afterwards. Then move it towards the upper side of the break site.
Tighten less than what you would tighten for the broken area, then spread by rolling away from the break place slightly and relax the tension slightly slightly until it takes a bit of the correct position. Then take another strap and roll it also over the broken area.
Circles then move the circling to the lower side of the break. Let your action in tightening and relaxing be according to what we mentioned in circling the upper first circle. Then place between the bandages some soft pressure or punctures as suits the irregularity of the break.
If there are irregularities and no such, do not make anything of it, then take another strap on top of it. Then set this on the circles the exact weights from your tool if there is no inflation or hot tumor in the body part.
If there is inflation or a hot tumor, bear on it what calms that tumor and eliminates the inflation, leave it for days, then tighten on it at that time with weights. The weights should be made from half the branches of finely carved reeds arranged with wisdom, or the weights can be made from wood from the water carriers.
They are made from cedar, palm fronds, bamboo or any of the things prepared from that, and each weight should have this shape and form exactly.
Except for the weight that is placed on the break itself, it should be slightly thicker and wider than the other weights. As for the length of the weight, it is made according to what suits the size of the broken part from its largeness or smallness. The shape of the weight:".
Then tighten on the weights with another strap according to your first tension exactly, then tie from above with tight threads as we mentioned about the tension, which is that your tension at the place of the break should be more. The more time passes after the break, the less tension there is.
It is necessary for the threads to be of medium thickness in terms of hardness and softness. They should be wet camel wool, especially since if the threads are as hard as what I saw done by the ignorants, they make them from twisted strips of wet camel wool, which is a great mistake.
Because it creates excess tension, and overly soft threads are also unsuitable as you cannot achieve the desired tension with them. It is not advisable for there to be less than a finger's width between each stitch.
If injury is caused to the patient at the ends of the sutures after tensioning in the correct locations, then place a soft or matted wool under it so that he is not harmed by this. If there is a break due to injury and skin laceration resulting in perforations in the skin, we will discuss this separately.
And know that not every broken part needs to be sutured on the first day. This is because if the body is large, stitches should not be placed on it until at least five days, or seven, or more, depending on your concern for the occurrence of a hot tumor.
And this is the property of the bandages that were forced onto the first ones put on fractures, breaks and stitches. It is a simple general bandage that forces the break and suits most fluids, especially for children and women because it does not overheat nor is it cold.
It is to take of the dust of grain, which sticks to the walls of the mill when the mill rotates, and knead it as is without washing it with egg white. Make the dough neither too thick nor too thin then use it.
Description of a last dressing, which forces fracture setting and dislocation reduction. It is taken from sheep, camels, gazelles, dogs, cats, and from each one it's removed eleven dirhams, every single one five dirhams, from silver twenty dirhams, and from the Armenian or Roman clay it's twenty dirhams. Everyone applies it, mixes it with water of silver clay or with the white of an egg if the urine mood is released. Then this dressing is used; its composition is good; it quickly forces broken bones and is suitable for most people due to its moderation.
Description of another dressing that also benefits in fractures and setting, it is taken from medical clay and white sand from each one eleven dirhams mixed with five dirhams water or egg whites. Each person applies it gently, mixes it and kneads it with water or the white of an egg, then uses it.
Description of a dressing for joints and bones removed from their places, which calms the intense pain and prevents bone dislocation and fractures. It takes the treated wool which is immersed in vinegar and cooked oil, placed on the affected area. This dressing lacks the force to set broken bones.
However, it is beneficial in calming the hot swelling and alleviating pain, especially. Description of another dressing that forces fractured bones, it takes tamarind leaf and basil leaf and mixes them all together then uses this mixture for two wet wraps. Description of a shorter dressing used during fracture occurrence.
And if you wish to completely dissolve the tumor, take from the silver sand, the borage leaf and the rhubarb root; all are taken in equal parts and mixed with a poultice. If the body part is not swollen, then mix it with oregano water or just water. Use it accordingly.
The description of another dressing, even stronger in its analysis compared to the first one, is utilized when a solid tumor occurs during bone eruption. It is made from the root of the wormwood, the gall-bladder and bile ducts, the crown of the king, and the root of the saffron and the pomegranate from each ingredient a single part.
Everyone punctures and kneads it in turbid water or fresh water, or with paint, all this according to the body's temperature and calmness of its heat. As for Galen, he did not mention in his book that an application should be made on broken members during setting.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil alone, it should be described to have a medium consistency between hardness and softness. As for Galen, he believed that things containing dryness with some heat like vinegar, patience, milk and similar substances should be applied on broken members during setting.
The description of a dressing that benefits from weakness and pain, it is made from poultice, cumin, human hair that has been combed or bird feathers, wormwood and equal parts of salt. It should be punctured, sifted, kneaded and applied with this dressing. As for the amount that should remain in the bandage.
Then, if you observe that there is no reason for pain or cracking and the broken bone does not move from its place, do not keep him waiting for many days. If it causes severe cracking or disturbing pain or swelling in the location.
Proceed to treat him immediately, do not delay this matter at all and remove the dressing. Then take a soft thread or an absorbent sea sponge that is wetted in the lukewarm water, wash the area with it until the itching stops and the pain subsides. Then leave the limb to rest for an hour.
Then it is covered with oiled and soaked wool in vinegar or rose oil, binding it overnight to calm down the hot tumor, make the organ stable, relieve its pain. Then it is repositioned into a gentle tightening, and a mild dressing, without over-tightening the first pull.
And continue to apply it until the patient recovers. If, upon observation, I find that the tumor, redness, pain, swelling and all symptoms have completely disappeared, requiring only dressing and tightening as before, do as you did initially; if no indication of what we mentioned appears in the organ.
Do not remove it until three, four, five or seven days have passed, or perhaps even up to twenty days depending on what you see regarding the condition of the organ as we described. Even if there is a risk of fracture and the healing process is close to completion.
In that case, add more tension than your initial pull throughout and also increase the density of the gauze as previously mentioned. If you see that the fracture site has dried out and become softer than it should be, understand that food cannot reach there.
Exert it with lukewarm water at each time of removal. Do this every three days and slightly ease the tension, for through this action food is directed to the organ and it heals quickly. As opposed to what the ignorant do by breaking the organ again with the application of soothsayers' remedies.
Indeed, if it is not forced to what should be and is forced due to pain, then that is an error in their actions, and a great deception. Even if it was correct, they would have mentioned this initially in their books and acted accordingly; I did not see any effect whatsoever from any of them on this matter. The correct thing is not to act upon it,.
The second chapter.
In the oblique fracture of the head.
The oblique fractures of the head are numerous, their shapes are varied, and their causes are manifold. Some fractures occur due to a sword strike and can either remove the entire bone until it reaches the skull beneath the bone. It's like what happens with carpentry in wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called carpentry-like, and it can either have the sword cut part of the bone but only its edge, not all the way through, in which case it's called a partially exploded fracture. The wounds from these fractures are either large or small.
There are also fractures that are brittle or cracked, which can be caused by hitting with a stone or falling on a rock or something similar. These fractures can either penetrate close to the membrane beneath the bone or occur in the face of the bone.
The wounds from these fractures can also either be large or small. There are also hidden fractures within the bone in the hairline, which is a gradual expansion.
This type of fracture is called hairline, from which there's a fracture that occurs due to falling or hitting with a stone and similar objects. It goes into the bone page inside and makes the place flatten like it exposes for copper when hit by a blow; part of it then enters inside.
Most of this occurs in the moist bone of the head, such as in children's heads. All these types of fractures can have clean and non-clean shards. We will address the treatment of all these in their respective sections. These different types of fractures are identified through examination.
Checking and removing the rotten flesh with knives, and for the type that can be seen, it is known to uncover upon the bones, smear, and touch them with a wadding. If the fracture shows up black, then first you should observe the symptoms of the injury.
If I see signs and symptoms that clearly indicate fear, such as dry heaving, extension, loss of consciousness, interruption of speech, fever, eyes turn red or a similar condition in symptoms, do not approach the injured person nor treat them. Death usually occurs to him with these symptoms in most cases without exception.
And if I see symptoms that do not alarm me and I hope for his safety, then you should take him in treatment. For if the injured hit you at first when he was wounded, and that happened during winter days.
You should make an effort to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in every case, and if it is during summer days, you should hasten the removal of the bone before the seventh day because it's likely that what's underneath the bone from the membrane could deteriorate causing the symptoms we described.
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and it's accompanied by a fracture and concussion, you should cut off the fractured and swollen part of what I'm describing to you. This means that you should shave the head of the injured person.
Exposing the bone in any way that allows you to do so, based on the wound's appearance and what becomes apparent upon examining the injured person, if during your examination of the bone you encounter bleeding or a hot tumor, respond to it as appropriate.
This involves filling the area with an incision soaked in a mixture of wine, oil, garlic, and cleaning the wound until the tumor subsides and bleeding stops. Then you take action to strengthen the bone and remove it, which can be done in two ways of work.
And if it is one face, then cutting the bone by a fine narrow saw cut, and this is its depiction:".
Then another cutting tool is used after this section, separate from it slightly, and this is its depiction:".
And you also use another cutting tool, also separating it a little from the second one. It is necessary for you to have several different sections, some of which are more separated than others and some of which are shorter than others. They should be extremely sharp at their edges. They may be made of Indian iron or good steel.
And use gentleness in hitting the blade on the section, lest you shake the head and harm it. If the bone is strong and hard, it should be pierced around before using the sections with the drills that they call submerged drills, but they named them non-submerged drills.
Because it does not exceed the limit of the skull bone to beyond it, in order that the drill has a cylindrical shape below his head similar to a ring or small circle, which prevents it from sinking and going beyond the thickness of the bone.
And you should take several of these drills, each one fitting the thickness of that bone so that you can provide a drilled skull whose tip's length and width matches the thickness of that skull. Here is an image of three types. From the drills, large, medium, and small:.
And as for the way of drilling around the broken bone, you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has penetrated then move the drill to another location and make after each hole a hardness or about the hardness of the deposit.
Then cuts are made between each pair of holes, and this is done as gently as possible with whatever capability you have so as to remove the bone either by hand or by means of another object from among the various tools prepared for that purpose.
Like the gentle joints and tendons, caution must be exercised to avoid touching or cutting into the fascia. When the bone has been inflated and separated from the fascia if attached, and once it is removed, it should be cleaned off.
Smooth out the roughness left in the bone with another tool resembling a cut, but it should be finer and softer than other cuts. If there is still some small fragments of bones or pieces left, take them gently using whatever tools you have available.
Then, treat the wound with the plasters and ointments that are mentioned thereafter. As for the other side of the work, it is a straightforward process far from pitfalls, which Galen mentions and highly praises, as he says: First, you should begin by uncovering a segment of the bone from the part where the break is strongest and most severe. Once this section has been uncovered, put its tip under this magnifying glass cut, here's how it appears:
The part under the magnifying glass is smooth and doesn't cut anything, while the sharp part of it on its sides in length as you see, making the part under the magnifier touch the fascia and the tip of the sharp cut in the bone. Then, strike the cut from one side only.
With a small mallet, so as to cut all the bone gently like it rotates while you are safe from the membrane there's no terrifying accident, even if the surgeon is inexperienced and cowardly indeed, even if he is lazy.
If there is anything left attached to the bone by its membrane in some places of the bone, split it off from itself with the tip of the curved saw and remove it gently; for it will be removed harmlessly and without fear.
And if the bone fracture did not reach the membrane, and what was broken off from the bone is its face, leaving roughness and small fragments remaining inside. It would be wise to remove this roughness and extract those fragments with a fine tool that has taken different sizes of instruments for use in various tasks according to which task you are dealing with, aiming to use each instrument more effectively and properly based on the needs of your work.
The same broken bone and its shape should be used first in removing the outer parts of the bone, then use a finer tool after that. Continue doing this with dedication until you are using all the finest and most delicate tools available to you.
And as for the smaller, hairline cracks and gentle breaks, it would be appropriate to treat each one according to what leads to better results which is something that those familiar with this field of work recognize. The method involves starting with what has been written and demonstrated about the treatment of major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you break your bone, it would be advisable to take a catgut suture according to the wound and immerse it in greasiness. Then place it on the mouth of the wound. Afterwards, take another curved or triangular needle. And immerse it in a wine of grease and ointment, then place it on the first suture. Do this as gently as possible so as not to weigh down the bandage. Then you use a wide elastic bandage above it, but only pull it tight enough to hold the wound itself.
Let him undergo this treatment for a day or two until the hot tumor stabilizes, then remove it and subsequently use the medications she has, which include yemasal like the roots of the hyssop, the powder of the basil leaf, dactyls, seeds of coriander and similar items. It involves making preparations from these medications.
Wipe the wound as it is dry, in general use a medicine that has the property of healing without causing discomfort. While you are treating your wound, make sure to keep it clean and free from oiliness or dirt, do not let pus accumulate inside.
Because pus, if it accumulates on the brain membrane, deteriorates and infects it. This leads to a great harm, and there may be headaches at the site when the bone is uncovered, especially if one neglects its treatment.
A black spot on its surface, if you look closely, reveals the symptoms that we mentioned; therefore, know that he is dead without a doubt. And even though this blackness occurred due to medicine applied to him and it was the strength of this medicine causing such darkness.
You should take a portion of honey and three parts of rose oil, beat them well together and smear them on a stick. Then apply it to the forehead, then treat him with various treatments until he recovers.
The Third Chapter.
Supporting the nose if it breaks.
Know that the nose breaks only its upper fissure, either both or one of them because they are bones. The lower part is made of cartilage and does not break, but it may be exposed to swelling, trauma, and infection.
If one of its bones breaks, it should be advised to insert the little finger into the nose hole and straighten this break from inside with your ring finger and thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. Do this gently and ensure that it does not harm the patient or cause pain.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger does not reach it, you should straighten it with a slightly rough tip. If the fracture is in both sides, do as stated before, and hasten to set it on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, but otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot boil subsides, then you should insert into the nose hole a thread from the needle if the fracture is in one side or two threads if the fracture is in both sides.
Let the thread in it be thick enough to fill the nose hole. Some of those who have done this early on mentioned that they should smear the thread with tallow and replace it every day, but I do not see that; instead, it seems advisable to smear the thread with a mixture of raw egg white and sandarac gum.
Then leave the thread until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens. You might insert into the nose where the thread was, feathers of the owl's comb after wrapping them with a soft needle piercing to make it harder for the breakage of the nose, so as not to hinder respiration.
This is not something necessary; you can choose to do it or leave it undone. If an opportunity arises for your work and there's a hot boil on the nose, heal the nose with tallow or by soaking cotton in honey and grease, or with some thing from the application of Diakhil's ointment.
If a hot growth is not treated, it should be grafted from outside using very fine seed and knitted linen. The paste made from this can be whitened like egg white, then place on it a soft bandage; do not bind the nose to anything at all, for if it breaks, it breaks in small pieces.
If it were to break, you should open it up and remove it with a tool suitable for the task. After that, stitch the wound and treat it with means that promote healing and reduce inflammation of ointments compatible with this. If there is an injury inside the nose, then it should be treated by cauterization and use copper pipes. Until it heals.
The Fourth Chapter.
If the lower jaw breaks.
If the lower jaw breaks, and if it is a breakage without injury, examined it. If it's only a break from outside and didn't break into two pieces but went inward, then its identification becomes easier.
If it is a break in the right fissure, you should enter the left hand's little finger into the baby's mouth. Likewise, if the break is in the left fissure, you should insert the left hand's little finger and lift the broken fragment from inside to outside gently.
And use the other hand from outside the bone to control its adjustment. If the jawbreak has split into two, it should be used on both sides for alignment until it can be adjusted properly. If tooth decay has occurred, then...
Or if it divided, tighten what you hoped would remain with a gold or silver or iron thread. Then apply the plaster on the broken jaw and then place a double needle stitch over it. Put on the button large but tight or a piece of shoe leather equal to the length of the jaw. Then connect it from above according to how you are able to connect it and fit its attachment, so that it does not fail. You should command the patient for rest and no movement, and make his diet the gentle food of al-Husayn (a specific type of Arabic cuisine). If you think that any change has occurred in its appearance from one aspect or another, intervene in its treatment on the third day.
Then connect it from above according to how you are able to connect it and fit its attachment, so that it does not fail. You should command the patient for rest and no movement, and make his diet the gentle food of al-Husayn (a specific type of Arabic cuisine). If you think that any change has occurred in its appearance from one aspect or another, intervene in its treatment on the third day. Then correct what you have added with the dust of gharra mixed with the whiteness of the egg white or with ground millet after removing the turban from it. Place a gentle pressure on the dressing, as long as that dressing sticks to him and does not change for the bone, leave it.
Do not treat it until it has healed and the break becomes very strong. This break often strengthens after three weeks, so if a hot lump appears during this period, use what we have repeatedly described to stabilize it until that lump disappears.
As for if there is a fracture with an injury, look. If it has healed from the bone by a fragment or fragments, gently remove those fragments according to what suits you to remove them from the machine. If the wound's mouth is narrow, widen it using forceps up to the extent that your need requires.
Then, if you have removed those fragments and there is nothing left of them, draw a line in the mouth of the wound if it's wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments that suits this. Let the wound heal until it has healed.
The Fifth Chapter.
In forcing the prosthesis if it breaks.
The prosthetic device most often breaks at the front end of the shinbone, and its fracture can occur on one of three faces. Either it breaks into two without forming fragments, which is easier to fix; or it forms a single fragment with one edge being different from the other, making it difficult to fix due to the lack of stability when applying force.
Either there occur fragments within the fracture, which is harder to set, or the fracture accompanies a wound. In either case when the fracture does not result from a wound, you should have two attendants; one of them holds the bone that follows the broken part of the arm in place and the other extends the neck towards the opposite side.
Then, smooth the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be and there's no bump or swelling. If you need more extension, it would be better to place a ball of tallow or wool underneath the elbow of the sick person.
And place the bone according to your need, stretch and lift the broken part, press the ball with your hand until the fracture is corrected as it should be. If you are unable to pull one end of the broken limb outside because she has gone deep inside, it would be advisable for the sick person to lie on his chest.
And place a medium padding under her kneecap and have the attendant press her kneecap downwards until the bone of the broken part which is inside comes above. Then, correct and smooth the fracture with your fingers.
And if you feel that a fragment of the bone has broken off and is moving, it should be cut open and that fragment removed gently. If the fragment is stuck inside the bone, turn it in one of the cuts prepared for this purpose. After getting beneath the bone, there is an apparatus that preserves the stitches which can be made of wood or iron. This is its image:".
It resembles a spoon without any swelling, and its width depends on the size of the bone you need for it and its smallness. As for its length, it is according to what you can for work. It should have two ends as you see; one end is wider and the other narrower.
If the wound rupture, which you made when removing a bone fragment from the incision is large and sealed off the hot tumor, then suture together the edges of the wound. If the rupture was minor or if you were afraid of the hot tumor, then widen the wound with the incision and adjuvants according to the size of the wound cut.
If there is a hot tumor, apply the piercing in greasiness of the wine and honey or the drink and carry it on him. And if the bone has been pulled out without a cut or incision, then you should carry on the bone with the pad made from dust of ashes mixed with the white part of the egg. Then place a soft burden on it, and if needed put the ball under his ribs. Then take an overcoat that is very long with its width being about one span or slightly more. Take a curved splint for the soft bed and padding, then take a mallet from a thin plank. Its width should be three fingers and the same in length, then place it in an incision. Then put that incision along with the mallet within the position on the overcoat where it is located under the fracture site. Then pull the overcoat towards the fracture as you would rotate it. Place a bandage around his neck, under his ribcage and below the patient's ribs. Adjust it back and forth on each side as you see fit to ensure the fracture is properly aligned. This should be apparent to you.
Ensure that the mallet does not move from atop the broken bone at all. Therefore, it is necessary to check on the splint every day. Whenever you find that the bandage has relaxed and the mallet has moved, correct this issue and tighten the bandage again. Then have the patient lie on his back for sleep at night and place a small pillow under his ribs during nighttime rest.
Let the bone rise on its side, and the fracture will rise by the height of the thigh or it may connect his arm to his neck. No ligature should be used if there is no sudden event of cut or tumor occurring within twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if I see fit for that. Apply the tension in the suture and leave it until the fracture sets, and this gets stronger over time. It becomes more intense and robust after twenty-eight days. And for some people, it may occur in less than that.
Chapter Six.
For correcting the fracture of the shoulder blade. If the shoulder blade breaks at its broad part, it only breaks its edges. Whenever a spot breaks or it breaks in the middle; this is recognized through touch. So depending on what shape the break takes, you follow accordingly.
Fixing it and restoring its natural shape through each of the tricks you can, then hold in place with dust from rhubarb mixed with white egg whites and soft cream. Then place over a wedge made from curved metal strips, after that place an elongated clasp from wood above.
Make it as thin as the shoulder blade or slightly larger, if below the clasp applies in one of the spots on the shoulder blade, then apply this compression with soft cream until the clasp settles evenly. Then pull from above using a long apron.
Apply a tight pull and securely attach the clasp so it doesn't move from its place, check the bandage each day. Whenever the bandage relaxes, tighten it and reapply the clasp if it moved from its place. Let the patient rest correctly on their side, and the shoulder blade should harden after twenty days.
One day or twenty-one days. If the allotted time is completed, the bandage will be removed and you'll be safe. Bone is among those that one fears neither breaking nor weakening. When a piece breaks off from the bone and it shrinks under the skin, cut it open and extract it. Perform what I have mentioned regarding breaking the constriction of the hot tumor, if something like that occurs.
Chapter Seven.
Inforcing the break of the breastbone.
The breastbone may break in its middle, and this is not very common. However, its ends are more prone to breaking and fracturing. One of the symptoms if it breaks in the middle is that it tilts downwards and exposes severe pain and difficulty breathing, along with coughing.
Perhaps there is internal bleeding, and the impact of the broken bone becomes evident through its wound, which can be felt by touch. To perform the operation, he should lie the patient on their back with a cushion between their shoulders. Then press their knees together and gather the ribs from both sides. Gently adjust them in each possible position.
And agree until the shape of the bone returns to what should be, then carry him on a stretcher and place something under him like a board or a companion piece of wood or something similar in lightness, after wrapping it with a bandage. Then carefully secure it on the broken bone so that it doesn't come off, passing the bandage around several times towards the back firmly. Check the bandage at all times and whenever it relaxes, tighten it again.
And if necessity demands his release when he is in pain or has a lump, then act quickly to remove him. Remove the bandage and correct what appeared due to its treatment as much as possible before applying it again if needed. Tie the wound and make him endure the tension until it heals.
The eighth chapter.
In forcing the ribs if they break, know that fractures occur in the most painful areas behind the back and its extremities. These are in front of the chest where the pain presents itself because they are cartilaginous. The knowledge of this is not hidden to touch.
Forcing it by correcting the fracture with fingers on the appropriate face until the shape is as it should be, then applying and tightening the broken bone with a splint if needed. If the rib fracture leans inward, it exposes the inside to pain which is severe.
And it withers like the withering that affects those who have a burn, because the bone withers and its enveloping tissue also causes difficulty in breathing and coughing up blood in large quantities. This is difficult to treat, many tricks were used in the past to address this issue.
Some argue that you should feed the fasting person in a way that creates inflation and wind, causing the stomach to expand. This pushes fractures outside of their place. We dislike this because it might be misconstrued as evidence of the development of a hot tumor if one hadn't developed before. However, if it did develop beforehand, it will intensify and confirm its existence.
Some say place it on the spot, inflated. Then compress forcefully, similar to measuring but with the concern that the inflated might attract more fluids towards the area due to his weakness. Others argue that covering the spot with a cloth dipped in hot oil is preferable.
You should fill the space between the ribs to make it full, then if you roll it tightly, the band will be flat. After that, treat the fasting person with food and medicine for the effects of fasting are intense and he can't endure them. The bone would shrink the scabbing causing pain and fear for the patient. It is necessary to cut into the location, reveal the broken side, then place an instrument under it that holds the wound open as described. Then we should gently cut through the bone and remove it.
Then we sew the wound shut if it's large, and treat it with poultices until it heals. If a hot tumor appears during this time, one should immediately apply remedies that soothe the blood and place them on the affected area to also calm the tumor from within.
He should sleep on the side that relieves his discomfort until he heals,./
The ninth chapter.
In relief of back and neck spasms./
If it is a fracture in the neck, fortunately such cases are rare and more common are those of excessive strain on it, especially during pregnancy. Similarly with fractures of the back. If this happens to someone and you want to know whether they will heal or not. So observe, if you see that their hands have relaxed and are numb, and they cannot move or extend them, nor can they clench them. If you pinch or prick them with a needle, they do not feel it or find any pain in them. In most cases, this means that he will not heal, so he is dead.
And if he can move them and feels pain upon pinching or pricking, you will know that the vertebra has moved and the patient is healing through treatment. If it's a back spasm like this, and you want to know whether they will heal as well or not.
So observe his legs, if you see them relaxed and what happens to them as with the hands then when he lies on his back, wind and feces come out involuntarily. And when he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily. And if he lies on his back and wishes to urinate but cannot, know that he is already dying. Do not bother treating him, for if there is no improvement in this condition, it will be even less severe. The treatment of such occurrences should aim at soothing the hot tumor.
And apply to the affected place, ghee alone or with boiled testicles, put this three times during the day until the hot tumor subsides. Then carry on that place one damp compress, bind it with a bandage and order him rest and calmness.
And he should not sleep on the side where he feels no pain until he recovers. If there was an issue during weaning that affected a bone fragment or something that was removed, it would be necessary to cut into the skin and extract that bone. Then gather the edges of the wound if it is large by stitching, then treat with medicinal ointments until he recovers. If the last fragment of the pelvis bone (which affects the tailbone) breaks, it may be necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the socket.
And straighten the broken bone with the other hand according to what is possible and feasible for setting, then apply a compress and bandage if needed, and tighten it.
And if you feel a broken fragment in it, cut and extract it, then treat the wound with previous treatment until he recovers.
The tenth chapter.
In setting the fracture of the thigh bone.
Very rarely do hip bones break; if they do, the breaking is that they shatter at their ends and split lengthwise, tilting towards the inside. This exposes them to looseness and pain in the affected area, and numbness and dulling of the leg that was broken from its side.
To test your understanding of the fracture, you should hold my hand on it until you determine its shape. If the fracture is only at the ends, adjust that fracture according to what seems suitable for the adjustment, so that it resembles its natural form.
If the fracture is along the length or has moved inward, place the patient on their stomach so that you can adjust the fracture accordingly. After adjusting it, apply a bandage and then place a splint made of wood or leather on it, securing it firmly.
Do not fear the displacement of the fracture or the removal of the splint. Adjust the reduction until it fills the space, allowing for proper traction. Command the patient to lie on their back or in the correct side position; if he develops a hot tumor, this is a sign that you should proceed with caution.
Release the traction and adjust until the hot swelling subsides. Then, apply weight as previously instructed on it. Reapply traction and adjustment according to what is required. If fragments are present in the bone or break off from its ends, it should not be removed.
And it does not touch but adjusts from the outside as we said, leaving the traction until it heals.
The eleventh chapter.
In the correction of a humerus fracture.
The humerus is the bone between the shoulder blade and the shoulder. If it breaks, you should adjust it on one of two sides: one where you take a well-polished, curved reed that has an intermediate thickness for this task:.
And fasten straps at both ends, then hang it from a high place. The patient should sit on a chair and put the broken arm over the reed stick until his elbow sticks in the middle of the curvature of the stick. Then, hang something heavy above him.
The attendant elevates it downwards, then the surgeon breaks the bone using both hands until the break is corrected as necessary. Alternatively, the patient lies on his back and secures his neck with a girth.
Then, she orders the attendants that one should adjust above the fracture using his hands and the other below it, each of them stretching towards their own sides. If you want more strength during this process, tie a girth under the break and another over it, with each attendant stretching towards their respective sides.
If the fracture is near the knee, it should be that one girth is under the bicep and the other below the fracture towards the lateral side. Likewise, if the fracture is near the lateral side, the girths are at that spot and on the lateral itself.
Then, the fracture is gently corrected without force until it becomes properly aligned and binds well. If it doesn't heal, continue applying pressure; if there's a hot swelling, discontinue the pressure until day seven and then apply a bandage soaked in vinegar and anointed with rose water.
Until the swelling subsides, then apply pressure. The method of applying pressure is to place a bandage over the fracture, then wrap it with a new gauze bandage on top of the bandage. Next, join your arm to the back itself and place your hand open on your hip.
And carry the gauze and pressure on the back and arm, so that the arm replaces the ribs. If it does not hinder you or change anything from the broken bone, if you fear something might change, then use the ribs (referring to metal braces).
It is to place a brace over the fracture itself, which should be wider and stronger than other braces. One should leave an interval of one finger between each brace, and the length of the braces should depend on the fracture with an extra three fingers on each side.
Then pull on the strings that were mentioned at the beginning of the door.
And it is that your pull on the break point should be stronger.
And the closer you are to the break, the less your pull should be; observe the position of the strings and pull as we described when straightening a member with your effort. Do so.
And if you fear the hot tumor, leave the tension and strings until the seventh day as we said. Then examine the ligament every three days to ensure there is no knot or bulge and that food can reach the member without obstruction due to excessive tension; this will all be according to what we have mentioned.
If you are confident that nothing of this will happen, the ligament should not be released until many days later. The patient should lie on their back with their hands on their stomach and a cushion filled with wool, moderately filled, placed under the member.
And inspect at any time of day or night, to ensure the broken member's shape doesn't deform and that the ligament isn't relaxed. Correct all this with your effort. Feed the patient on a diet as we suggested before - initially mild food until the bone becomes firm.
You should strengthen his diet. It's common for the bone and leg to become firm after forty days, at which point he should be discharged and use baths with suitable treatments. If it was a horrifying broken bone that has healed satisfactorily.
Don't release the ligament for him until fifty days or until two months.
The Second Chapter.
In levering to break the arm.
The arm is made up of two bones and called the carpal bones. One is smaller, it follows the thumb, and the other is larger, placed under the smaller one from below. It may break alone or the small one, or both together.
If the smaller upper carpal bone breaks, levering becomes easier and is done more quickly. If the lower carpal bone breaks, it results in a poor break that is hard to see. If both carpal bones break together, especially if the bone containing the broken small upper carpal bone, it makes the situation even worse.
When the surgeon performs levering, they should make the pull gentle and gradual until it becomes smooth. If the large carpal bone is broken, the pull should be stronger. If both carpal bones are broken, the pull should be even more intense.
When performing levering, the shape of the hand should be as if it is grasping something. The hand should be laid out flat on a cushion with the thumb raised above all the fingers, and the little finger placed below the other fingers. The wrist should be in a stable position, upright on itself.
Let the cushion for the hand rise above him so that the wrist does not bear the strain of the operation.
Then, servants extend the arm from below either with their hand or a bandage. Another servant extends it from above similarly. Then, the doctor straightens the bone as much as possible until he can return it to its best form. If there are fragments in the fracture, they should be removed.
Return every fragment to its place. If you see a clean fragment, and it is degenerating the skin, do not attempt to force it during levering. Remove it with precision as we have explained in what came before. If there was a fracture with an injury, then you should add another section for that.
To treat this condition, if you encounter a hot tumor in your first section of treatment, use an incision with the prepared khyriyyah, which is greased with rose oil and white beeswax. Make it moderately thick between being too thin and too soft. Gently pull on the incision until the tumor settles.
If you remove the khyriyyah, place the bandage prepared from gypsum powder mixed with egg white, then hold the splints. The splint to be placed on its own break should be slightly wider and stronger. Remember that in most cases, there will be six elbow splints.
If the break is in one arm band or both simultaneously, then make your pull at the site of the break stronger and harder. And as you pull upwards or downwards, let the pull be slightly curved upwards following what was mentioned earlier in the first chapter.
Let the incision that wraps around the break be a gentle, moist cut and do not make it too hard. Use a special type of thread made from goat's wool to pull with; let its thickness be moderately between being soft and coarse, as we described earlier, and check on the limb and the brace after several days.
If something occurs that needs fixing, such as scratching on the limb, it is necessary to wash the limb with hot water until that scratch subsides and leaves the limb unstrained overnight so that it can rest. Then, it should be re-tightened.
If the tension has relaxed and/or the bone has been freed or to that degree, correct all of this according to your efforts. Also, check if food is unable to reach the limb due to excessive tension; in such a case, it might be necessary to slightly relieve the tension and leave it for days until food can reach there again before applying tension anew.
If the ill does not show anything of what we mentioned, it should not be treated before twenty days or about that period, then the hand of the ill is hung on his neck and let his arm be balanced and watch his efforts from chaotic movements and make his sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm will heal in thirty days or in twenty and three, and perhaps it will heal in eight and two, all of which depends on the conditions of humors and conditions of strength,
The thirteenth chapter.
In correcting the fracture of the hand and fingers.
Very rarely does the comb of the hand and the phalanges show a fracture, rather it's the palm that often displays signs. If the hand or the palm shows signs of a fracture.
It is necessary for the patient to sit upright with a chair in front, allowing them to be balanced.
Then, place their hand on it stretched out. Then, extend the broken bone and smooth it until it heals well. At this point, a bandage and crutches are necessary if there is no hot lump, then carry an iron sandbag from above according to its position.
And I have included it in a soft bandage. If the fracture is downwards towards the palm of the hand, make a half sphere from the bandage and ask the patient to hold it with their broken hand, then pull it with a long bandage.
Make the sandbag from a soft skin, so it can adhere to the palm's curve and pull it as needed. If the fracture is outward, make the sandbag above and another one below in the palm, so that the hand opens up upright.
Then hold the forceps as you would move your hand, and intertwine them between fingers with a bandage. If the fracture occurs in one of the phalanges of the finger, if it's the thumb then don't correct it according to what is necessary, then pull against the palm and not the back of the hand should you want to make it standing small for setting the fracture.
And do not move if the fracture occurs in other fingers like the middle finger, ring finger or index finger or wrist bone. It's better to correct it and connect with the following correct finger or all of them properly attached together. Alternatively, place a small standing pin on her.
As we said about the thumb, examine while setting and keep away from the hot tumor. Match it with what is necessary when such a thing happens repeatedly as described.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In setting a thigh fracture.
The thigh bone frequently breaks and can be felt by touch as it moves forwards and backwards. It is treated by pulling a bandage over the break and another below, with the limbs laid flat on its face.
Then each attendant bandage is extended towards its side in moderation if the break occurs in the middle of the bone, while if it's close to the thigh, it should be pulled with a softer strap, either from wool or similar.
At the thigh to near the elbow, let the pull be upwards and another bandage below for the break. If the break is close to the knee, it should be close to the knee too, with the pull downwards. Then, the doctor adjusts the bone with both hands until he returns it to its natural shape.
The bone bonds well, so when this happens, it is advisable to use padding and compression. If there is no lump on the member, then place padding and compression. But if a lump does occur, leave it for days until the hot lump subsides, then return to its treatment.
If it is a splint, it should be laid over the fracture with a firm and broad bandage for two or three times, leaving some of it behind. Then lay the leg until the heel is at the beginning of the limb, and pass a long thread between thigh and leg near the knee, making the ends of the string above from both sides.
Then turn over the leg and thigh what is left of the bandage. Then place on the thigh at the same position as the fracture the splints, making one splint on the bone of the leg. Then fill in the gap between the thigh and leg with soft plaster to make the band smooth.
Then start with strong pulling in the middle at the site of the fracture, three or four turns depending on how far you are from the site. As you pull further away from the fracture site, make sure your pull is less forceful and gentler.
Then, proceed to the other end of the thread that you had inserted between thigh and leg. Fasten it to what is above in the splints from above. Then pass both ends of the thread downwards until they reach the ankle. Tighten them as well against the other side of the splints.
So that the band doesn't come off its place. Then leave the pulling on it until there's no pain or lump, and so forth on the member. If anything occurs like this, address it promptly and repair everything that has happened according to what we've mentioned repeatedly.
If a splinter is found in the bone and causes it to reduce, you should aim to correct that if possible. If not, split it and remove it. Treat the wound with what was previously mentioned until it heals. This may strengthen the fracture of the thigh without needing to add the leg bones.
As we mentioned in the shoulder and arm, except that making him stronger like this does not expose him to the disease of paralysis. If she is strengthened alone without adding the leg, there must be a permanent paralysis for its owner.
And be aware that the thigh bone strengthens over fifty days, or it may increase slightly or decrease slightly; all of this depends on the variety of conditions and other circumstances.
The fifteenth chapter.
In the fracture of the kneecap.
The kneecap is seldom exposed to fracture, but it can often be injured due to damage. If a fracture does occur in the kneecap, it may either be a crack or a break within its parts. This can happen with an injury and without one.
You base all of this on touch, and strengthen her by trying to gather together what has separated in its parts using your fingers until they come together and fuse based on how the gathering can be done gently and skillfully. Then you apply the bandage and use a girth if needed.
Then you pull strongly above the corresponding strain, and then ensure all conditions we described in other fractures like the hot swelling etc., that each symptom is matched with what suits it until it heals.
The sixteenth chapter.
In setting the fracture of the leg.
Indeed, the leg has two bones, one of which is thick and called thigh bone and the other is thin and called tibia. They are subject to many types of fracture just as the bones of the upper arm. Therefore, the fracture of the leg is like that of the arm where the work is alike. If both bones in the leg break, the leg turns towards all sides. If only the thinner bone breaks, the leg turns forward. And if the thicker bone breaks and it happens from below, this is something you should be aware of.
So use stretching and adjustment, apply bone setting according to this method. But if the fracture of the leg is severe with many fragments, then make the stretching less intense and lighter, applying more force in the process of setting it.
In the leg, there is something extra compared to the arm. When you have adjusted all bones and finished your work, take two willow whips that are used for flattening rooms placed between slits in boards or made from bamboo strips or similar items.
Choose one that has a slightly rough texture and is not made of thin sheets. The length should be as long as the leg from the knee to the bottom. Then wrap each with two coils on its length, placing one coil around the leg and the other around the opposite side.
Make it from the knee to the bottom of the foot. Then, tie the willow whips in three places on both ends and the middle. With this binding, you prevent the leg from leaning either to the left or right, and firmly set it in place. A sponge can also be used along the length of the leg.
It should be placed to prevent any movement and it is most important to do this when there's a particular wound in addition. Then, inspect the leg every day with great care to detect any swelling, puffiness or other signs. When something like that occurs, respond with what should be done in order to recover, and the major fracture will be healed within thirty days or thereabouts.
The seventeenth chapter.
In the case of breaking bones in the leg and fingers.
As for the heel, it does not break like the tibia. However, fractures of the leg bones do occur and also those of the fingers are less common but usually involve dislocation rather than fracture in most cases.
If the bones of the leg fracture and I see that some of these bones have nearly touched each other, let the patient stand on his foot like a camel. Then place your foot on what has risen from those bones and then press it down and smooth it out.
So that it returns to its place, then apply the bandage and pressure from above placing a small flat board under the sole of the foot with two smooth surfaces. Then firmly pull the foot using this method and wrap it with all else needed.
If three or four days have passed, release the bandage. You will find that if the bones were broken they are flattened out or if they were bent you perform the work as you see fit. And if some of the fingers break, force them and smooth them according to what I described to you for bending fingers of the hand.
Then make the broken finger into a bend along the length of the finger, and have it slightly turned away from this. Then place under the foot the board as described to you and pull it tightly with force. If two or more bones broke in the bone,
Then make a bend on each finger of the same force as if in a soft stringer, and pull the board under the foot. Let every tip of the board be slightly outside the sole of the foot to adjust well.
You should not forget to agree upon all that we have told you about the various symptoms we mentioned, and respond to each symptom with what is appropriate.
The eighteenth chapter.
In the case of a woman's disappointment and excessive suffering, and mentioning the man's condition.
If the female's chastity breaks, make her sit upright then lean her slightly towards her back. Hold her from behind and use cotton to insert inside until it fills up and becomes like a ball in her body.
Then shake the woman and lift her slightly. This cotton will come out until it reaches near to the female genital area like a ball, then the fracture returns. Then place a support on her back. Whenever she wishes to urinate, remove the cotton gently so that she can urinate.
And return it to the way she first inserted it. Then, go back to her original support. Do this for seven days or a little more as it tends to become stronger. If you wish, you can take a sheep bladder and pull on its narrow end with a tube. Insert the whole bladder into her female genital area.
Then, inflate the tube strongly until the bladder inflates inside the female genital area. The fracture will return, then stuff it with cotton and leave for a period as described until it heals. If the bone of the pelvis in men or women breaks, it can be used to help heal the fracture.
And make it as we described for the thigh bone, and there is no doubt about this in these strange fractures that occur rarely, especially for those who have some experience. You will understand my writing well because the fracture itself guides you most of the time.
On the correct path in correcting and tightening, understand it well, and as for when a man breaks [his bone], take an ox's horn, insert the man into it, then wrap him with linen strips and bind him. He should be left three days or around that time until he recovers.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In correcting bone fractures if there is a wound.
It is necessary for one who has been presented with a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large like the thigh bone or elbow bone or similar, to hasten in correcting it from its time when helped by the conditions of the fracture as we have provided.
If the wound is bleeding, it is necessary to cut it by applying a powdered substance on it if nothing else prevents that. Then take the correction of the fracture in this day with the same eye and do not delay it.
If no hot lump occurs, if a hot lump does occur leave the correction to the ninth day until the hot lump settles. Do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all because it will cause bad symptoms for you.
If the broken bone, which is on the skin and exposed, should happen to be so, it may be necessary for you to try to restore its return and its adjustment with your hands gently and a brief extension. If it doesn't come back and adjust with your hands, then do this with the instrument, it's an iron machine whose length is equal to seven or eight fingers. Expose it according to the wound.
Therefore, it is necessary for the doctor to take three or four according to what he needs from treatment in every type of fracture; let it be a little greasy so that it doesn't bend when rubbed on during work.
A sharp point has a continuation on its end, with the top part going towards the base and the lower half extending downwards extremely. This is how it looks:
And it is called in Greek as 'perim' which means a small defect. It should have its sharp curved end on the bone that comes out and push it with one strike until, after the bone returns and becomes somewhat level, 'perim' causes settling of the fractured edges upon each other.
If its broken end is fragile and the machine has not taken it properly, it should be cut at that end of the bone so the machine can take it. If it cannot return to its place as described, it should be cut like what we have mentioned before.
Or spread it out with one of the splints as best you can, then remove any roughness and thin scales left in the bone. If after putting the bone back, you find an intense painful lack, know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
If you are able to return it to its natural place, do so; this greatly benefits the sufferer. Once you have stabilized the bone, dip a splint into a special tight, black drinking liquid especially if it's summer. Do not cover the wound with an ointment or anything that contains oil.
To prevent the formation of mold and decay, then use splints when you are free from stabilizing the bone. Leave the wound open so that you can cut into its folds with scissors to create a hole according to the size of the wound.
Be extremely cautious not to pull the wound excessively with fractures, as many unskilled doctors have done this causing death or mutilation of their patients. Your pulling should be mild and different from other breaks.
If the wound is poor or it's a large wound with some bad symptoms that we described, and he feels pain in the affected area causing irritation, then there should not be metal plates put on it. Instead, make him bandages from hard cloth at the place of the plates and tighten them.
If after a day or two, you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth bandage you had placed on it with water. Then use the ointments and remedies we usually apply to wounds such as the four-in-one ointment and similar items, and it would be good for you to change the dressing.
And inspect the wound every evening and morning until it heals and is cured. It should be positioned so that pus can easily drain downwards. If it has been days with no sign of healing and there's still pus, realize that there are small fragments of bone in the wound.
And you should inspect the wound with a probe. If there are remnants of those fragments that have not been removed, remove and extract them. If they have not been removed and cause swelling and pain in the affected area, remove and force out all possible parts using every method available.
If the wound shows signs of infection, decay or any other form of corruption and contamination, it should be treated with remedies that correspond to each symptom as described in their respective sections.
And when you hear or think about bones breaking, especially in major limbs like the thigh bone and the back bone, do not expose yourself to that force nor attempt to pull them out. Many times, this can lead to death. Rather, leave it to rot until perhaps it falls out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
When I find a place for treatment in the wound, then treat it. Otherwise, leave it.
The twenty-first chapter.
In treating the complication that appears after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after healing of the fracture, especially near joints, where it can distort the shape of the organ and may prevent its natural function.
Examine it, if the complication is hard, use medications that constrict like myrrh, honey, vinegar, unzuwet and acacia among others. Take some of these or all of them, mix them with a grabbing drink, or with the white part of an egg, or with lemon juice.
And apply it to the complication with effort, tighten it on it strongly and leave the tightness for many days without relieving it. Then relieve it and repeat this process until it goes away, if Allah wills, or you bind a sheet of tightly polished lead on it.
And lead has a property that removes all that is inside the organs. If the complication had hardened and tightened and it was necessary to remove it, cut into it from above and remove or cut off the resulting flesh with some pieces of rag until it goes away and treat the wound until it heals.
The twenty-first chapter.
In treating fractures where the person is forced and afterward, the organ remains delicate不同于 its original nature.
If the bone fracture occurred under pressure and afterward, the organ remains delicate and weak, this can be due to many reasons. One of the reasons could either be due to excessive manipulation and tying improperly, or over-tightening of the ligaments causing food not to pass into the organ, or excessive beating or shaking out of time, or lack of blood in the body leading to weakness.
Treating this involves nourishing the patient and filling his body until there is an abundance of blood in it, using baths and making him happy and joyful among similar actions. Then carrying out circumcision on the member so that much food would be drawn to it or its extension is prolonged by wetness. Until the food starts to pass and returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In treating broken bones, if the displacement is forced and prevents it from being as it should be.
When a member, after it has healed, presents with deformation or alteration of the shape due to displacement or stiffness of the broken bone or difficulty in its movement. Otherwise, if the member does not refrain from its natural action, it is not appropriate to accept the claim of those who say they break the member from the head; and many ignorant doctors and enforcers have been doing this in our country.
This act is highly condemned, leading to great deception and stiffness. However, if the deformation and stiffness are mild, it should be treated with water that has been boiled with soothing herbs such as mint leaves, its root, and the crown of the king, among others.
It is treated with soothing powders like the tightly ground Dihayl or aloe juice is taken and mixed with chicken fat, sperm jelly, and applied. Or it takes ripe dates and grinds them with chicken essence water and such medicinal preparations called anti-sagging.
Stiffness is resolved by the constant, gentle rubbing done with hands and movement of the limb in all directions at all times. If deformation has occurred and become severe and hardened, it calls for its treatment with iron.
In this, one must cut above it and release the connection of the bone, cutting what is preferable from the complexity or the bones with smooth segments. One should use care in doing this with effort and attention, then treat the wound as described until it heals.
The twenty-third chapter.
The jaw is a joint that, when it slips out of its place, impedes movement and disfigures the appearance of the member. It causes intense pains and suffering to the patient. If someone's jaw happens to slip, one should immediately take steps to reposition it.
There should be no hesitation in treating it, as delaying the swelling of the area and the movement that accompanies it makes it more difficult to reposition the jaw. For this reason, one should not delay, nor move, nor extend the jaw while it is swollen because it often causes discomfort and painful spasms for the patient.
However, if this happens, one should immediately relieve the patient's discomfort. After that, he should wait until the swelling subsides slightly. Then, he uses hot water and oil to treat the area before gently trying to move it back into place. Finally, each joint is treated with what has been described for its condition in its respective section.
The chapters on the jaw have also been arranged according to what has been discussed in fractures from above the body to below it.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In treating a lower jaw fracture.
Jaw bones usually only partially detach in rarity, and if they fall out, it occurs on two conditions: either they move away from their places slightly and rest for a while; or they come out completely to rest. To the extent that saliva drips from the weak person, he is unable to hold it back and cannot endure applying his breath, causing his tongue to move with speech. If his sweating is mild, he would usually return closer to himself in the easiest manner.
And if his sweating is complete, it should be expedited to return him quickly without delaying at all. The act involves having a servant hold the head of the weak person, and inserting one of the doctor's fingers into the root of the jawbone inside his mouth. If the jawbone is on one side.
Or he would enter all his fingers if the jawbone is on both sides and place his other hand's fingers outside to guide him, commanding the weak person to relax his jaw and let it go towards every direction. The doctor then guides the jawbone and pushes the jaw until it returns to its position.
If his return is difficult, especially when both jawbones are involved, use the gauze with hot water and oil until it eases their return. Do not delay their return at all as we have said. Once they return and align, causing no stricture in the weak person's mouth if he has not relaxed yet, place bandages over them with a wick made from beeswax and oil to be placed inside.
Then, gently tie him with a non-stretch bandage. The weak person should sleep on his back and have his head cushioned between two pillows so that he is not moved to the left or right. He shouldn't have to chew anything; instead, make his food light.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw tightens, let him eat what seems fit to him. Use this carefully, do not force him to open his mouth when eating, drinking, or inhaling until the jaw tightens and he recovers.
If the jaws prove difficult to retract at some point, particularly when they have not returned to their original positions, this often leads to fevers and constant headaches. It may also cause the stomach to turn inside out or result in painful vomiting. If you observe this, realize that there is a malunion.
Often it dies within ten days from this condition.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In retracting the maxilla and the tip of the mandible.
As for the maxilla, it does not separate from the inner side of its connection with the chest. It may move outward and this can be sensed by touch. The correction necessitates that the patient lie on his back with his arms extended.
Then, with your palm, apply a strong pressure. If it returns, place the dressing and splints on it and tighten them. As for its end that connects to the mandible, it does not move except in rare cases; if it ever moves, it should be adjusted according to what we have mentioned and what is prepared for you.
Then, place the dressing and splints on it and apply a firm hold. You should order the patient to rest and abstain until they recover. With this same treatment, the tip of the mandible will return if it too has moved from its position.
The twenty-sixth chapter.
In retracting the mandible.
Be aware that the mandible can only separate in three directions: The first is when it moves downwards towards the wrist, the second is when it moves towards the chest and sometimes upwards from the mandible. These occurrences are rare.
The extraction does not extend behind the shoulder area nor in front of the nerve position, and it extends more often downwards towards the wrist, especially in those with little flesh as it quickly emerges and enters their body.
As for those with plenty of flesh, it is different in that it leaves and enters with difficulty. It might cause some people a strike or fainting which causes swelling on the leg and heat making them believe they have extracted too far. It would be advisable to test this to determine its validity regarding its effectiveness.
Then, when you advance in its treatment, the extraction becomes clear. If it has gone downwards towards the wrist, and if you examine between the bent leg and the correct leg, you will find an obvious difference. You will notice a swelling of the head of the leg bone inside, and upon touching under the wrist, you will feel that the head of the leg bone is like a small egg.
The invalid is not capable of lifting his hand to his ear or making any movements, and similarly, if the extraction has gone towards the chest or upwards, you will find this visibly upon touch.
This extraction may facilitate its return if it is smooth or if the invalid is a child. For returning, have the attendant lift his hand above, and then place my thumbs under his elbow. Lift the joint with strength upwards to its position, while the attendant lifts his hand and extends it upwards.
Then press it downwards, and he will return quickly. If he doesn't return as we have described, and if the bone has remained since a long time after the operation, then it should be recommended that the invalid take a hot bath and use moisturizing oils that relax and soften the skin like cooking the head of the ostrich, lentils, and the crown of the king in water and using them.
Then the patient lies on his back and a ball of wool is placed under his elbow, being moderate between softness and hardness. Then, the doctor stands behind the ball and holds the hand of the patient with his hand, extending it downwards.
Then he pushes the ball with his foot; he returns to this position, and if you wish, he repeats it in this way - having a longer leg than the patient. He stops him on the side and puts one of his calves under the elbow of the patient, lifts his elbow up so that the patient is hanging in the air. And another attendant pulls the patient's hand down towards his belly. If the patient is light, it should be attached to something else to make him heavier. He then releases his jaw from its position, and he might also do this in another way.
It involves focusing on the ground a long wooden stick, which has a round tip similar to the head of an axe; it is neither thick nor thin. Then place under the patient's elbow after placing a small notch on the top of the wood. The patient stands at the length of the wood.
Then he extends his hand downwards from the other side and also extends his body strongly on that side. The joint returns to its place quickly; if it is hard to return with all what we mentioned, then use this treatment: take a piece of wood whose length is about two arms. Lay it out as wide as four fingers and make it thick as one finger. It should have a round tip to facilitate its entry into the depth of the elbow in this form:.
Then, attach a small notch to the round head to prevent harming the patient's bone. Place it under the elbow and extend all the hand and arm downwards on the wood. Attach the wood to the scapula and the elbow, and fix the end of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a stand. Lift with the front and extend the hand downwards, leaving the rest of the body suspended from the other side. The joint should enter from its place; if it can enter in any way possible, one should place beneath the foot a ball of moderate size made of wool.
Then the prepared poultice, made from camphor, frankincense, and egg white is placed all over the thigh as it rotates overhead. Then, the ball is pulled down firmly under the hip. The bandage is then wound around the poultice from above, and his hand is attached to his neck.
And he should not move his hand for seven days. It should be that the nourishment of the patient is slightly cooked until the member strengthens; it is faster in its healing. Then, after the seventh day or five days, he should practice movement. If it has been established and did not relax, then it has healed.
And if the joint keeps popping out due to frequent exposure to moisture or another cause, it should be used in trisection treatment as described in the section on trisection. If this is done for all of it and the bandage is removed after seven days, but the joint does not stabilize.
And the poultice was repeated and pressed onto it multiple times but did not stabilize, fell down, became lax, and could not lift it up. So you should know that the nerve in the thigh's head has either snapped or stretched, or become lax. You should then realize that the joint will never be stable in its place.
And as for the jaw that is towards the chest and breasts, and behind, it should be reversed by pushing and pulling with hands until it returns. And all kinds of pressing and treatment are used until it heals. If there appears to still be a body in the muscle after healing, but moves more slowly in movement.
Let the bath not be taken frequently and excessively so that the body softens and returns to its original nature.
The twenty-seventh chapter.
In the treatment of dislocation.
The shoulder joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns that way. It can dislocate in all directions, particularly forward or backward. Its dislocation is not hidden from you as it occurs within your sight and touch, to whatever extent it has dislocated.
And when you compare the dislocated shoulder to the correct position, it becomes evident to you through palpation of the joint. The arm cannot bend and it does not touch his armpit from you. It is necessary that you quickly and return the dislocation under your hand before he turns hot, because hot swelling can make repositioning more difficult.
If he shows you a hot swelling, it is difficult to return the dislocation and perhaps it won't be fully corrected at all, especially if the dislocation was towards the back. It's the worst type of dislocation and the most painful, and it often results in death alongside it.
And if it is something that can be corrected, you have a servant extend his arms with both hands and spread out his arm, while the doctor holds both his hands over the shoulder from above and under it, pushing the joint with all his fingers or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is forward, it can be corrected by bending the hand once until it hits the elbow that follows behind, whose base you press against. If the shoulder does not return to its place upon this, apply extreme powerful traction and have the arm extended as far as possible by two servants.
The scribe also holds the patient's attendants to prevent any loss when he withdraws during high tide, then raises the arm to each side after wrapping a folded garment or a wide sheet around it. And if the surgeon doctor starts with his hands, he rubs them in oil so that they can easily perform the dissection task.
Then he pushes the joint with a strong thrust until it returns, and after its return, there should be placed on him the bandage containing grip and drying with egg white paste. It is tightened firmly and the arm is hung from the scribe's neck, leaving days.
Then, if the joint has firmly settled in its place, remove the bandage from it and leave him alone. If I saw that the joint didn't tighten properly, redo the bandage and leave him also for days until it tightens, then remove it. If he develops a growth after the return of the joint and removal, do the same process again.
If there is difficulty in movement, then use the wetting in the bath and gentle rubbing until it softens or make a slippery method on the joint like that of fat sheep's skin. Then tie it and leave it on him for one day and night, then remove it and introduce him to the bath, if he sweats, gently scrub the joint as needed.
Then redo the method on him once, twice and thrice with entering the bath until it softens. If you wish to put him a wet bullock's hide mixed with fat and tighten it on him, do this several times as it softens and returns to his original state.
The Twenty-First Chapter.
In treating dislocation of the elbow.
The elbow joint of the arm often dislocates and its repositioning is easier compared to other joints, except that it should hasten the repositioning of the joint while it's still before returning to its place or while it is hot.
The text instructs to place the patient's wrist on a board, extend their arm and have them hold a doctor's hand. The doctor then places his palm on the joint surface and pushes until he returns it. However, one should check if the bone has moved towards the inner part of the hand.
Let the patient place his palm on the board when stretching and retracting their arm. If the bone is protruding to the top of the hand, let him place his wrist underneath the board so that the doctor's hand comes in contact with the same joint surface. If it returns immediately or not, apply a soothing compress for swelling.
Leave him alone as he doesn't return it and you can't force him to do so after a few days. The joint remains in its place without causing harm to the patient, except if his hand relaxes and he can't hold anything.
Then, you will know that the nerve has been severed or it is paralyzed and there's no help for it but to hold the wrist with a splint; it might help or not. Once the wrist has returned to its normal position, put on the described bandage, then hold and release every five days.
Then, he should warm up the hand. If she can't move it and there is a part of the muscle visible in it, it should be gently warmed with hot water and steam until it softens.
The Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
In the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in all directions. When one of the fingers has dislocated towards the top or bottom of the hand, extend the finger and push back the bone with your thumb until it returns to its place. Then, secure the tip of the finger and hang it towards the direction it had moved.
Leave it for two days, then release and extend it until it becomes steady upright on the day of its growth. If by night it follows this description, it will continue to do so during the day as well. It will practice movement by day and restraint at night; performing these actions every day until it strengthens.
And similarly, if it bends towards the palm of the hand, you should tie it back to that side and perform your initial action upon it until it recovers. Similarly, when it bends towards all other directions, do the same with it.
Chapter Thirty.
In treating dislocation of the back.
When a segment of the vertebral column in the back or neck is dislocated, either completely or if there are many segments out of place, there is no treatment for it because death hastens.
This is indicated by the ileum's feces being expelled without will, and it cannot be contained. Often some of its members relax from it either a leg or an arm or one of them, and if one segment has moved from its place, it often moves again.
If it moves in four directions, the one that moves behind is called an ulceration. As for its treatment, if the ulceration occurred during infancy, there is no cure for it and it cannot be completely relieved, whereas if it occurred due to a fall or hit, etc., this can happen.
I have mentioned earlier various methods of treatment in long, sometimes unnecessary explanations. I have distilled from those a few essentials that provide enough insight for a multitude of approaches that I've taken towards understanding and detailed for you, visualizing the machinery differently than what they present and explain.
I say that any blistering occurring in front of the chest has no remedy and is not cured, likewise those on both sides. It is only the one that occurs specifically on the back that needs to be treated as I describe it, which involves covering the afflicted area with a dressing.
At the pharmacy, set up level close to a wall and spread under it a damp mat so as not to harm his chest. Then place a standing plank buried in a hole in the ground at one end of the stall near his head and another plank towards his feet at the other end of the stall.
And a servant holds the plank, and let it not be securely fastened in the hole, and another servant holds the other plank like this. Then wrap on the chest of the patient and under his ribs with a thin and tight cloth, extend the cloth towards the plank by his head and tie him to it.
Then, with another cloth, tighten it above his hips and around his knees and at his crotch. Then gather all the straps together and tie them to the other plank by his feet. Both servants extend their ropes tied to each plank, but neither of the planks should be removed from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not tightly fastened as we said, and the doctor places his hands on the hinge with force until it retracts or places a plank on top of it, then leans on the plank with his legs until it retracts. If this treatment does not work, take a plank whose length is about three arms' length.
And dig into the wall, as we said to be near the patient where one end of the plank can enter. Then place the center of the plank on the shelf and places his doctor's legs on the other end. Pull tightly until the hinge is compressed.
Return to its place, and if you wish to make it with the screw that is handled by hand, which involves piercing into the earth at the head of the sickle at the end of the handle with two pieces of wood whose length is one arm's reach. Also at its feet at the end of the handle in question, another two pieces of wood.
Let there be a gap of one finger between each piece of wood, and it has been made in every piece of wood a hole into which the screw fits. All the wood is firmly anchored into the ground, ensuring that it doesn't move. A rod goes through these two holes in the wood, this rod being the screw into which the band is inserted at the holes in the pieces of wood.
At the end of it, there is a hole that a rod with the same length as one finger has been anchored into, and in the other pieces of wood too. Then pull tight the band which was fastened at the sickle's handle screw near its head, and the bands which were pulled tight at his legs by means of the screw located under its feet.
Then, he stands in front of each screw, his hand manipulating the tool used to turn the screw and the doctor is shaping the groove according to what we have discussed, this is an image of the screw, the handle and the sickle:.
Then, after the defect has returned and the position is standardized, it should be that you carry the dried bandage in the color of egg white. Then apply the strain. Afterward, place above the bandage a pad made from a plate whose width is three fingers or close to this, and its length should match the size of the groove.
On a few correctly set nails, then tie it with the band that should be used and the sickle eats gentle food until it is healed. If there's still some swelling in place even after full healing, then you should use the relaxing and softening medications together with using the board we described for a long time.
And for this purpose, a lead plate may be used, and it might appear in the last vertebrae of the back, causing one to believe that it is falling out, being an extra bone that has protruded. It should not be treated with such remedies, as this might result in death.
The thirty-first chapter.
In treating the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the knee joint are only subject to dislocation, not to other minor displacements or indentations. The hip joint dislocates in four directions.
And that is because it can dislocate towards inside and outside, as well as in front and behind. Most often, it dislocates towards inside, while less so towards front or back. The sign of its internal dislocation is that when you compare the sound leg with the sick one, the latter will be longer.
The knee is more common than the correct one. The invalid can't bend his leg at the knee and there will be clear signs appearing before the thigh bone reaches that place.
The sign for someone with a dislocated joint outward is the opposite of these symptoms. The sign for someone with a forward dislocation is that he extends his leg fully, yet it doesn't bend without pain at the knee; if he tries to walk, he can't do so forwards.
His urine is retained, his knee pops when he walks, and the sign of dislocation to the back is that he cannot fully extend his knee before popping his kneecap, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
The kneecap is relaxed, and the thigh bone can be clearly seen at the back. As for returning types of this dislocation, if you observe that the joint has been stuck with its partner for a long time without trying to return it, remaining in its condition, there is no complete cure for it.
It should not be exposed to it, while if he was opened and belonged to any of the four types of jaw breaking, one would proceed by articulating the joint and extending it inside and outside, moving it left and right, perhaps.
He returned and did not require any other treatment, if he didn't return in this manner, it should be commanded a strong attendant to extend his leg from below either with his hands or by tying a belt around his leg above the knee, another attendant should also lift him from above.
So that he puts his hands under his elbows, then pulls with a soft belt around the upper thigh and holds one end of the belt, another attendant, third, will be there to lift him, either forward from the side of the hip to the side of the knee or backward towards the back.
All of them lift him only once so that he raises his body from the ground and remains suspended. This type of lifting is a common feature for all four types, if the jaw returns as we said or otherwise, it's necessary for each type, according to the specific treatment I mentioned.
And if his response is that the jaw goes inside, it should be commanded for the patient to lie on his correct side and tie belts around the upper thigh where between the hip head and the place below the hip.
Then, pull the band above from the side of the hip up to the upper body towards the knee area. Then, another attendant takes strong support with his arms and embraces the thick part of the thigh of the supine patient and extends it outward greatly; if he returns to his position.
And this type is easier than other types of treatment where this body part returns, if you couldn't convince him or he didn't respond to entering this type of treatment at all, it should be commanded to tie both legs of the patient with a firm soft band around the heels and on the knees.
In each of his companions will be four fingers' length and the hollow leg will extend more than the others by two fingers, then he suspends the hollow one above the head from a beam which is in the house and it is as far from the ground as the span.
Then, she commands a strong servant to embrace the thigh and another servant to hold onto the hollow part and pushes the other servant who is embracing the thigh with strength. The joint returns quickly to its place. As for its particular response if it's outside (referring to dislocation),
The hollow should lie on the stretcher according to what we described in the person with the socket. The strap should be tightened especially on his hollow leg and on his chest. Then, two pieces of wood are placed: one under his feet and the other under his head. In addition, an extra piece of wood is placed in the middle of the stretcher firmly attached.
He might have wrapped her with a wet cloth so as not to harm the hollow, placing the wood between her thighs so that she doesn't sink when stretched. Then, each servant extends towards him and the doctor adjusts his hip with his hands. If it responds to going back.
And otherwise, place the board and secure it as we described in the manual. Either way, it should be that the hollow is to lie on his side correctly, if dislocation was forward, then it should extend the hollow leg once while he's in this description position on the stretcher.
The doctor places his right hand on the hollow's back, then he presses it with the other hand while making sure that the pressure extends downwards towards the knee. If dislocation is backwards, then it should not force the hollow downwards.
He is raised on the ground, but it should be made subject to something solid as it should also have its elbows and knees projected outward according to what we mentioned about his laying down on the mallet table and him being on his face with the straps tightened.
According to what we said previously, it is necessary to use the cups on the board also at the position where the joint reached. If the thigh joint returns as it should do and its return becomes apparent, then extend the legs of the patient.
Once you see them level and the patient's leg is being gripped or released without any pain, know that the limb has returned as it should. Then, brace both thighs and carry the bandage, pulling tightly with your arm so that there is no movement of the thigh from side to side.
The patient must rest for three or four days. After that, remove the bandage and leg support, then interchange legs. If you find both in the same position, know that the fracture has healed, and allow the patient to walk. If you see any sign of relaxation.
Retreat and re-bandage him as you did initially, then leave him also for three days. After that, remove the bandages and allow him to walk on them gradually for a while until he strengthens sufficiently, if God wills.
The Second and Third Chapters.
In the treatment of dislocated knees.
The knee dislocates in three directions: inward, outward, and downward or behind. Not forward of the patella. The sign of its dislocation is for the patient to be commanded to press his leg towards his calf.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. Apply pressure to all surfaces of its dislocation for him to sit down when he's lying down. If his strength allows, have him sit facing forward and stretch out his legs. Otherwise, have him stand behind a caretaker who will hold onto him in the middle and slightly move him backwards. Then sit yourself on his thighs.
And place your back against his face, and put one of his legs between yours. Then hold his knee with your hands and interlock them in the middle of his thigh, then press both palms firmly on his knee with another caretaker stretching out their leg until the knee returns to its original position.
A sign of its return is when the leg adheres to the thigh smoothly and without pain, then straighten it and attach it to the thigh. Then bandage them all together with a three or four day ligature. Don't use this method except for light walking for a few days until they strengthen.
If returning it as described is not possible, then use strong stretching with the ligatures that I have described for hip treatment until it returns.
The Thirty-First Chapter.
In treating dislocation of the ankle.
The heel bone may partially dislocate or completely separate. Its dislocation can be either towards the inside or outside. A sign of this dislocation is to see the swollen and prominent heel protruding in the direction it has moved to.
As for treating partial dislocation, it is easier to return to its place with gentle assistance and smoothing until it does. However, when the heel completely separates, it would be necessary for him who is suffering from this to sit down, while a strong caretaker holds onto him firmly in the middle of his back.
Then hold your right hand on top of his foot and your left hand at the bottom of his foot, at the level of the knee. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand followed by your left hand, twice. Extend it with your left hand and push the front part of the foot towards the thigh without force.
You perform this action twice as we described, then push the front part of the foot towards the leg in the third time while pulling the knee. If it returns to its original position after one or two repetitions in this manner and you find that the foot is level, otherwise redo the operation on it because it will revert back.
If it doesn't return to its original position even after doing as described, then place the invalid on their back on the ground and press down. Dig deeply into the ground with a mallet until it falls between his thighs where I have tied him tightly so that he won't be hurt by this action. Then, adjust the attendant of his thigh.
Then, another attendant extends the leg either with his hands or by tying a girth around the calf of the leg. Each attendant then extends against the other's action, with their buttocks standing between the thighs of the invalid to hold him back, so that his body doesn't get pulled down when they extend it. The doctor then adjusts the jaw with his hands.
Another attendant holds the correct leg down. The jaw returns quickly, and when it returns and you see that it is returning properly, carry the bandage and the pressure, and tighten it with tight straps, pulling the foot down with the strap. You should avoid the nerve above the heel from behind.
So that the strap does not become too tight and harm him, leave it for two or three days. If the strap relaxes, tighten it again, then release it on the third or fourth day. The invalid will refrain from walking for forty days.
If one tries to walk before this period, there is no guarantee that the jaw won't collapse and cause damage, nor will it accept treatment afterwards. If a hot tumor appears and it is necessary to use something as described in other parts of our treatment guidelines for its calming until it disappears.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In treating dislocated fingers of the hand.
It is necessary to gradually restore what has disengaged from it with a gentle method over a short period of time. This isn't difficult, rather it makes things easier. If the dislocation occurred in certain parts of the foot, it is recommended for him to place his foot on an even level on the ground.
Or on a plank while he stands like a shepherd. Then, you yourself place your foot on the joint as it is from those joints, then press it with your foot firmly until it returns and you see that it has been restored without showing in its place.
Then, place under the sole of his foot a plank that takes the whole of his foot, providing it with two ends. Then firmly tighten him three days in an efficient and tight manner, afterwards allow rest for long periods away from walking until he strengthens up safely, if God wills.
The thirty-fifth chapter.
In various types of dislocation that occurs with injury or fracture, or both.
If something like this happens and its treatment includes immobilization, it often leads to death.
For this reason, it should not be prescribed for such a treatment unless one is cautious in their practice, patient, and considerate without being hasty or overconfident. They should initially use medications that calm hot tumors only and follow up closely.
By fate, Allah, do not let it be what you feared from safety in the light illness and showed some hope to you in it. Respond to his request in the first affair before the hot tumor occurs.
And if the organ returns as I desired, use the treatment that calms hot tumors. Treat the wound with what suits from dried ointments, and if there is a fracture in the jawbone accompanied by occurrences of clean fragments, remove them. And adhere to what we have mentioned in simple diseases as stated in their respective sections.
And strive, purify yourself from entering into the paths of deception as you have been advised. That will benefit your efforts and protect your reputation should Allah will it.
