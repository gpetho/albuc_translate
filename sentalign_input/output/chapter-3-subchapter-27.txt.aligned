On the treatment of elbow dislocation.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the elbow.	0.9822215
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty; it dislocates in all directions, mostly forward or backward, and its dislocation is not hidden from you as it is felt beneath the clothing or touch in whatever shape it is dislocated, and when you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clear to you, as the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm or touch the muscle with it.	The elbow is with difficulty dislocated and with difficulty put back. Now dislocation may be in all directions, and particularly forward and backward. Whatever way it is dislocated it will not be concealed from you, because it is both visible and palpable, and whenever you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one it is quite openly and plainly manifested; for the elbow joint is hollow and the patient cannot flex the forearm back or touch his shoulder with it.	0.88680136
You must act quickly and reduce the dislocation before it becomes an inflamed abscess, for if it turns into an inflamed abscess, it is difficult to reduce, and it does not heal easily; especially when it is backward, as it is the worst type of dislocation, with the most pain, and often leads to death.	You must hasten and reduce the dislocation as rapidly as possible before an abscess occur. For if an abscess occur the reduction of it is difficult and maybe it will never be healed; especially when it is a posterior dislocation, for this is the worst and most painful of all the kinds of dislocation, and often it is fatal.	0.8886238
The restoration, when it is possible to reduce, is done by extending the hand with both hands, and the arm stretched out, with the doctor's hands on the elbow above and below, pushing the joint with the thumbs together, or with the palm's edge until it returns to its place.	Now when it is one of those that can be reduced, the way to reduce it is for an assistant to perform a two-handed extension of the patient's hand, the patient's forearm being opened out, while the doctor's hands are above and below the elbow joint and he thrusts the joint with both thumbs together or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.	0.82232785
But if the dislocation is forward, then it is returned by bending the hand with one's own hand until the elbow is struck with the palm's edge.	If it be an anterior dislocation, it may go back if the hand is bent sharply back until it strikes its own shoulder with the root of the palm.	0.7848002
If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous and very strong extension.	If the dislocation does not respond to reduction, apply very strong and powerful extension.	0.9066236
Two assistants should extend the arm, holding it firmly so it is not moved during the extension.	For this, let two assistants pull on the arm while two other assistants hold the patient against the extension.	0.6143411
Then the arm should be turned in all directions after being wrapped in a long cloth or bandage.	Then the arm should be rotated in all directions after the limb has been wrapped in a long folded cloth or a broad wrapper.	0.9400396
When the doctor touches the joint with their hand, they should oil it to facilitate lubrication and ease, then push the joint forcefully until it returns.	When the doctor begins manipulating the joint he should anoint his hands with oil so as to assist, by its lubrication, the movement of the joint; then he should thrust the joint powerfully until it goes back.	0.8454633
After reduction, a poultice with astringency and drying properties mixed with egg white should be applied, bandaged tightly, and the arm suspended from the neck, left for several days.	After its reduction he should apply to it a plaster having some styptic and absorbent qualities, with egg-white; and put on a firm bandage and suspend the patient's arm from his neck and leave it for some days.	0.7833054
Then it should be unwrapped; if the joint is stable in its place, the bandage can be removed and left off.	Then undo it; and if the joint remains fixed in its place, then untie the bandaging and leave it.	0.84269595
If the joint does not seem stable, reapply the poultice and bandage, leaving it for several days until it stabilizes; then unwrap it again.	If you see that the joint is not thoroughly firm, replace the plaster and bandaging and leave it for a few more days until it is firm; then untie it.	0.88759995
If heaviness occurs after joint reduction, and movement is difficult, administer moistening baths, gentle rubbing, and compression until relieved; or apply fat-tail sheep’s rump, which is very fatty, to the joint; bandage it, and leave it on the bone day and night. Then remove it, bathe the joint; when dry, rub it with gentle friction, and reapply the fat-tail sheep’s rump, doing this once, twice, and three times, the corruption has already come over the knee from the bath entry, until it is smooth.	If, after the reduction and unbandaging of the joint, it becomes stiff and is difficult to move, soften it in the bath and apply gentle friction and massage until it is softened, or apply to the joint the tail of a fat-tailed sheep; bind it on and leave it on for a day and a night; then remove it and send him to the bath, and when he sweats apply moderate friction to the joint; then replace the tail and again and again, alternating with the bath, until the joint softens.	0.8890723
If you wish, apply a humid and heated cow's spleen to the joint, pressing it on; do this several times, as it is moist and helps restore its condition.	If you prefer, apply to it, and bandage on, fresh cow-dung lightened with butter. Do this a number of times and it will soften and return it to its original state.	0.7532643
