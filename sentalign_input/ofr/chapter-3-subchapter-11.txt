of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder blade is that which is between the neck and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, it should be restored according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a stick of medium thickness, of this shape:
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them up, and have the patient sit on a seat;
then place their broken arm on the stick, up to the armpit, and have a curved piece of wood in the middle, then hang some heavy object on it or have the assistant extend it downwards;
then the physician sets the fracture by putting his hands together, until the fracture returns to its proper place.
And the other method is that you lay the patient on their back, and tie their hand to their neck, then instruct two assistants, one to hold above the fracture with his hands, and the other to hold below with a cord, and each pulls on their side.
And if you want the pulling to be stronger, tie a cord below the fracture, and above the fracture, and have each assistant pull on their side.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, you should place a cord under the armpit, and another towards the neck, below the fracture;
and similarly if the fracture is near the neck, a cord must be placed there gently, without force, so that the fracture is aligned with the place, and with the neck;
then set the fracture properly, as it should be, and bind it, unless an abscess develops there.
And if an abscess develops there, do not bind it for up to seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides; 
then bind it, and the way to bind it is to put the plaster on the fracture, then bring the arm against the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the chest;
and put on the bandage, and tighten it over the shoulder and over the arm, so that the arm is in the shape of a star, unless something prevents it, or if the bone is displaced.
And if you are concerned that the bone might move, use splints, and place a splint on the fracture wider and stronger than the others, and have a finger's width of space between each splint, and each splint should be large enough to extend three fingers' width past the fracture on each side;
then bind over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, tighter and less loosely.
And if you consider the placement of the splints, and the bandaging, as we have described, at the time you are setting the broken limb, and you fear a hot abscess, leave it unbound until the seventh day, as we have said; 
then check the bandaging every three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur at the location, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight.
Adjust it, as we have described.
And if no such issue arises, do not unbind it before three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, with his hands on his stomach;
and place a cushion filled evenly with wool under the shoulder, and check every hour of the day or night that the alignment of the broken limb does not shift, or that the bandaging does not loosen;
correct it with the power of medicine, and give him the food that we have mentioned before, in such a way that the food is initially light;
and when he begins to recover, let it be substantial.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be fully healed in forty days;
and then it should be untied and administered a bath and medicinal ointments to restore the area.
And if the stiffness is severe and swollen, it takes fifty days or two months to loosen.
