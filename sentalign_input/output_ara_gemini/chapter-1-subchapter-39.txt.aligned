Chapter thirty-nine on cauterizing the uterus.	CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE. On cauterization of the womb.	0.8664384
If a substance of coldness and humidities occurs in the uterus, it thereby prevents pregnancy. And its menses are corrupted and its flow is difficult. Or pain occurs to her at its arrival. Then it is appropriate to cauterize three cauterizations around the navel as we mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder.	When matter arises in the womb from chill or humidities and she is thereby prevented from conceiving and her menses are upset; their flow fails or, as they pass, pain accompanies them; then you must cauterize her three times around the navel, as we have mentioned in cauterization of the bladder; and once or twice in the lumbar region in the lower part of the back over the hips.	0.82366884
