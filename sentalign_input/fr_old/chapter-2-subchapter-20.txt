About the prolapse of the eye
When the eye entirely prolapses and there is no disturbance to the nerves or reduction, you must bind the patient; then bleed them, then apply cupping glasses or suction cups without piercing to suck, then place a binding on the eye made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocol, and then compress the eye and apply a plaster with bands and cloths; and the manner of the cloths is that you take very soft cloths, fold each one into four, and then place one on top of the other according to the amount needed for the eye; then compress it firmly with a hard band, and repeat the cupping for suction without piercing; then remove the cups and leave the eye compressed day and night, and if the binding softens, you must compress it again firmly; then remove the binding after a day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, that is good; if not, then restart the plaster, cloths, binding, and cupping until it is healed.
