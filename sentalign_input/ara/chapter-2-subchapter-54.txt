Chapter Fifty-Four.
On the Treatment of Acne.
We have already explained in the classification the types of ascites, how the water gathers, the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines. The type that is treated with iron is only the ascitic type, and the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are not approached with iron at all.
For that is deadly. If you have treated this ascitic type of dropsy with medicines and your treatment has not been successful, then observe: if the patient is extremely weak or has another disease besides dropsy, such as having...
a cough or diarrhea, and so on, then beware of treating him with iron, for it is dangerous. If you see that the patient is strong, has no disease other than dropsy, and is neither a child nor an old man, then the way to proceed is to have the patient stand upright before you.
And an assistant behind him should squeeze his abdomen with his hands and push the water downwards towards the pubic area. Then you take a pointed scalpel like this:.
Sharp on both sides, long, with a pointed tip like a scalpel, except that it has a slight bluntness so that when operating you do not penetrate the intestine and harm it. Then observe: if the dropsy originated near the intestines.
it is best to make the incision three fingers below the navel, directly above the pubic bone. If the dropsy originated from a liver disease, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the navel. If it originated from a spleen disease, let the incision be three fingers to the right side.
Also, the incision should not be on the side on which the patient wants to lie down, so that the fluids do not flow to that weakened area. Then puncture the entire skin with the instrument, then insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
with the scalpel between the skin and the peritoneum as if you are skinning it, and the amount that you skin should be about the size of a fingernail, or thereabouts.  Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is where the water is. Then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument, which looks like this:.
It is like a small tube, a thin reed made of silver or copper or polished smooth lead.  It has a small hole in its bottom and three holes in its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Its tip can also be sharpened, like the point of a pen, like this:
At its top end is a ring. When the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately flow down the instrument.  So drain a moderate amount of water at a time, because if you drain more than is necessary at once, the patient may die due to the collapse of his vital spirit.
Or he may experience fainting close to death.  Instead, drain an amount appropriate to his strength and as indicated by the patient's condition, from the strength of his pulse and the good color of his complexion. Then remove the instrument and stop the flow of water, as it will stop immediately.
This is due to the skin that closes the hole on the peritoneum, which I told you to pad in that way. Then repeat the procedure another day if you see that the patient can tolerate it.
And also drain a small amount of the water. Do this for several days while being cautious and guarding against error, until only a small amount of water remains. If you are concerned about the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand.
And [promote] profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and restrict him from drinking, and treat him with drying medications until he recovers.  Cauterize him on the stomach, liver, and spleen after draining the water as I described previously.
