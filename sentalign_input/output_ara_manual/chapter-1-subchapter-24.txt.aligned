On Cauterization for Diseases of the Lung and Cough.	On cauterization for pulmonary disease and for cough.	0.9120698
If the cough and disease of the lung are due to cold humors, and the patient does not have fever or phthisis, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the clavicles in the soft, empty, depressed areas, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.	When the cough and pulmonary disease arise from cold humidities and the patient suffers from no fever or wasting but the disease is chronic, sear him with two cauterizations over the two clavicles, in the soft depressions ; and with another cauterization in the mid-line of the chest between the breasts.	0.86525023
And the cautery should be nail-shaped in the form that was described previously. And if you wish, let your cauterization be by puncture with the cautery that is called the "puncturing cautery," whose form was previously presented in the puncturing for earache. And the punctures should be from thirty punctures to about that number.	And if you prefer, make punctate cauterizations with the cautery called 'punctate'; its shape has already been described under pricking for earache. The punctures should number upwards of thirty.	0.84852594
Then treat him with what was mentioned previously until he recovers.  A cautery with three prongs can be made in this form, and cauterization with it is faster because you cauterize three cauteries at once with it.  And this is the form of the cautery.	Then treat as aforesaid until healed. Sometimes also a trident cautery is prepared, in this manner, with which you can burn more speedily; for with this you can apply three cauterizations at once.	0.76736176
