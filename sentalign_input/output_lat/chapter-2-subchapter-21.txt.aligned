When a rupture occurs in the uveal layer, then it protrudes and extends outside the eyelids like a grape, disfiguring the person's appearance because of it, and if you wish to cut it: the procedure is as follows, as I describe: insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.	When a rupture befalls the uveal membrane so that it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids looking like a grape, and on this account the man's features are disfigured; if you intend to cut it away the operation will be as I am about to describe.	0.75963867
Then insert another needle with a double thread on the side of the lacrimal gland, and make it penetrate: and leave the first needle in its place.	You introduce a needle to the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper segment; then you introduce another needle threaded with a double thread, from the region of the canthus major where you will perforate it; and leave the first needle in its place.	0.65662813
Next, cut at the spot of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the needle: and tighten it firmly.	Then cut the place of doubling of the doubled thread, and with it ligature that part of the excrescence around the needle and tie it well.	0.7671973
Then remove the needle, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye: and leave it, until the thread falls off with the uvea.	Then remove the needle and apply to the eye wool moistened with egg-white; and leave till the thread falls away with the growth.	0.83458674
Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it, until the wound heals.	Then treat the eye with fortifying dressings till the wound be healed.	0.8551961
And sometimes the uvea is compressed all around with a cloth band, until the eye gains a large prominence.	Sometimes the uvea is tied all round with a circle of material so that the prominence of the eye is greatly increased.	0.8222879
Then it should be pierced with a fine spatula that reaches the depth of the eye, allowing the whitish fluid to flow, and the eye will lower and immediately return inside: then compress it, until it heals.	Then you perforate it with a fine scalpel going to the depth of the eye; and an albuminous humour will flow out and the eye will shrink and return at once. Then bandage till healed.	0.777406
