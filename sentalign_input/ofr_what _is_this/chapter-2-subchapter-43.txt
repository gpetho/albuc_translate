of quinsy
The ancients spoke and wrote about cutting the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the flap of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be avoided; and that one does not provide help through this, because all the veins and the lungs of the patient are close to those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the tonsils. 
When the illness is in the trachea of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the death which comes from strangulation.
It is necessary then, when we want to cut the epiglottis, that we cut it below three or four rings, a small incision across, between two rings or about the size of the incision for a syfac, not into the cartilage; and this place is suitable for the incision of the epiglottis because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far from there.
And if the practitioner is fearful, he should stretch the skin of the throat with the hook, then cut into the flesh until he reaches the trachea; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see any, and then cut the syfac, as we have said; and it is demonstrated by the expulsion of phlegm from the trachea which jumps out through the place that is opened, and by the loss of voice; and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed during which strangulation is feared, bring together the two lips of the flesh wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage; then administer medicines that promote flesh growth, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely blocked, and the patient is judged to be dying, and lacks breath.
Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death; and for this reason the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the danger of the illness has passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they instructed to sew the wound and treat it, until it was healed; and I will tell you what I saw.
I saw that a young woman took a knife, and stuck it in her throat, and cut part of the trachea of the lung; and I was called to treat her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had come from it, and knew well that she had not cut a vein or principal vessel but the throat, and the air came out through the wound.
I hurried, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the young woman except that her voice was hoarse, and afterwards returned to its normal state; therefore I say that in cutting the epiglottis there is no need for fear.
