of the fracture of the hip bone	On setting a fractured hip.	0.47953218
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it does happen, it is only a small break at the head; and it runs lengthwise, and slopes downwards, and the patient feels pain in the area, and a pricking sensation, and swelling where it is broken.	It is rare indeed that hip-bones are fractured, and if they are fractured the fracture consists of a comminution of the extremities of them and a longitudinal splitting and a bending inward; and the patient feels a pain and a piercing at the site, and the leg on the fractured side is benumbed.	0.83441794
And the restoration is that you extend your hand over it, until you are on the fracture; and know what the fracture is like and its shape; and if the fracture is only at the head, align this fracture so that it returns to its natural shape.	To set it, you pass your hand over it and ascertain what the shape of the fracture is. If it is a fracture of the extremity only, set that fracture in whatever manner is convenient for you until it answers to its proper shape.	0.72666764
And if the fracture is lengthwise, where it slopes inward, have the patient lie on their stomach, so that the reduction of this fracture is accessible to you. And when you have aligned it, apply the plaster, then put on a splint of wood or leather, and tighten the fracture so that it does not move; and fill the area under the ribs, so that the bandaging is even.	But if it be a longitudinal fracture or it has bent inwards, have the patient lie on his stomach so as to make it convenient for setting the fracture; and when you have set it apply over it a plaster and over that a splint of wood or leather, and bandage it in such wise that you have no fear that the fracture may extend or the splint slip.	0.8373924
And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.	Level out the cavity of the lumbar region with some filling so that it may take the bandage evenly, and bid the patient sleep on his back or on his sound side.	0.54819787
And if hot abscesses develop there, do not touch them until the hot abscesses have subsided, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the reduction, and tighten it as needed, if there is no bad outcome; and this is the method.	If there occur an effusion, then refrain from bandaging or setting it until the effusion subsides; and apply to it something to allay it as before said; then return to setting it and bandaging it as it should be.	0.72402906
