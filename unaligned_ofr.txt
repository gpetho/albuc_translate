Therefore, it is necessary that you protect yourself, so that foolish doctors cannot speak ill of you. So take up your tools with reason, and treat your patients gently and firmly, and use the best method so that by the grace of God you achieve a successful outcome and are praised; and leave the dreadful diseases of difficult healing; and remove your tools from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you can go from this world to the next with glory.

[] [23]
It behoves you to be wary and to shun such, lest the ignorant have an opportunity to reproach and slander you.

[] [24]
Show, then, caution and care for yourselves and gentleness and perseverance for your patients.

[] [25]
Take the best road that leads to health and a happy outcome.

[] [26]
Illnesses that are very threatening or difficult to cure, leave alone.

[] [27]
Purify yourselves of anything which you fear may cause doubt as to your religious life and your secular life; for this will perpetuate your good name and will elevate your fortunes in this world and the next.

And place it on the spot marked with ink, and make it descend by pressing your hand little by little while turning it; then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place to see if you see the bone just a little; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you; then take a little salt, and put it in water and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then put on cotton soaked in butter; and leave it on until the burn is gone; then treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmakon", until it is healed.

[] [7]
Then bring it down upon the marked place with one downward stroke with gentle pressure, revolving the cautery; then quickly take your hand away while observing the place.

[] [8]
If you see that some bone is exposed, the size of the head of a skewer or a grain of vetch, then take your hand away; otherwise repeat with the same iron, or, if that has got cold, with another, till the amount of bone I have mentioned is exposed.

[] [9]
Then take a little salt dissolved in water; soak some cotton in it, apply to the place and leave for three days.

[] [10]
Then apply some cotton soaked in butter and leave it on till the eschar falls off; then dress with Tetrapharmacum ointment till healed.

of the old headache

[1] []
When a chronic pain comes in the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use irises and pills which are called "cochie", and purging of the head and oils and plasters; and if the cautery that we have spoken of before is done, and it is not effective.

[2] []
Take care if the patient's head is of a strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize it a little under the cautery that we mentioned above.

[3] []
After that, make a cautery on each temple of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and make a cautery in the place which is called "vessels"; and it is a place where one puts cupping glasses; and lighten your hand so that you do not go down to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere; and it is necessary that the cauteries of the temples be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:

On cauterization of the head (continued).

[] [2]
 When the whole head is affected by chronic headache which has for long vexed the patient, and electuaries, laxatives, errhines, oils, and plasters have been applied; and particularly if he has undergone the single cauterization which we have described, all with no effect, then look well, and if his head is naturally strong of structure and is not weak, and if he feels a vehement frigidity, cauterize him over again a little above the first cautery; then cauterize him on each frontal prominence with one cautery so as to remove the thickness of the skin and expose as much of the bone as we have mentioned above; and burn him with one stroke on the hinder part of the head in the place known as the occiput; but in this cauterization be gentle and do not lay bare the bone; for thus the patient would have intense pain, different from that of other head cauterizations.

[] [3]
I shall describe this cauterization in its own place.

[] [4]
The cautery for the frontal prominences and occiput must be more slender than that for the middle part.

 CHAPTER FOUR.

[1] []
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of illnesses, and it is not effective, and you see that the aforementioned cauterizations with medicine and iron are not sufficient, then you must heat the cautery which is called "cultellar" until it is white; and first mark on the painful spot a line half a finger long, and remove your hand immediately, and restrain yourself so that you do not cut the artery and that you do not go down to the bone; and beware of the mandible which moves when one chews, and the nerve which controls it so that spasms do not occur in the patient, and beware of bleeding from the artery when it is cut, where cutting is very dangerous, especially for one who is not familiar with it, and who is not a student and experienced; and leaves the work half done; but I will tell you how to stop the blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you where it is appropriate in this book.

[] [2]
 When you have treated a migraine in the way we have described and with what we have mentioned in the sections on diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you perceive that the malady is such that the cauterization we have mentioned before does not suffice for it, either with caustic or with the actual cautery, you should heat an edged cautery to white heat after you have marked the place with a line half a finger's breadth long or thereabouts; and impress your hand once and maintain the pressure till you cut down upon the artery and reach the bone.

[] [3]
You must be careful of the mandibular joint which moves in chewing, that you do not cut the muscle or tendon that moves it, causing spasm.

[] [4]
Have the utmost care of haemorrhage from the artery you have cut, for the occurrence of that is dangerous, specially with one who does not know what to do, having no experience or practice; it is better to refrain from operating.

[] [5]
We shall later on mention a treatment for accidental haemorrhage of the artery, in due detail, in its proper place in this book.

It is necessary that the head be cleansed with herbs and with what we have said before; afterward shave the head of the patient, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck; and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is tolerant, and the illness is severe, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the core is mostly burned, and lift your hand; afterward treat it until he is healed, and let the cautery be the one called "olive-shaped" which we have mentioned before.

And if the malady of flaccidity of the body require still more and the patient be fit to bear it, and his disease be severe and have a strong hold on him, burn him with four more cauterizations on his dorsal vertebrae and carry the cautery to burn almost through the thickness of the skin; then remove your hand and treat him in the aforesaid manner till he is healed.

[6] []
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even, then make a myrtle leaf shape out of parchment; then take French soap and quicklime, one ounce of each, and grind them together well; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the shape you have made like a myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid; and if the patient has it in only one eye, you should work on one, and if in both, likewise; and place cotton moistened with egg white under the eye; and let the patient's head be on your lap and put your index finger on the medicine, and press a little and move it every time the patient feels the medicine burning, because it feels like fire.

[] [13]
This is the method of burning with caustic: bid the patient let the lashes grow long and straight; then make the shape of a myrtle leaf out of paper.

[] [14]
Then take of common soap and of quicklime of each the weight of a drachm or thereabouts and beat them well together rapidly lest the mass get cold; then spread this on the paper shaped like a myrtle leaf and apply to the eyelid of one or both eyes; place also under the eye cotton wool soaked in egg-white; the patient's head being in your lap.

Instruct the patient to place their head in your lap; and the practitioner should hold their head between their hands in such a way that they cannot move or shake their head; then place cotton moistened in egg white or purslane juice on the eye; then heat the cautery, which is like this: and is shaped at the end like the feather of a vulture, similar to how the cautery should be; if you wish, it may be pointed from one end to the other, or if you wish, it can be like a tent; however, this one that is shaped is better for your work.

Bid the patient put his head in your lap; and let an assistant hold his head in front of you without moving or stirring.

Then place on his eyes cotton wool damped with egg-white or mucilage of psyllium seeds.

of the abscess of the throat

When an abscess arises at the base of the throat or in the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, it subsequently festers and rots and ages and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have described in the sections, and it is not at all effective: then you must take a cautery according to the size of the fistula; then insert it into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand there until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the furthest point; and do this once or twice, then treat it with what we have described in the treatments, until it is healed; and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.

 When there comes a tumour in the base of the gums or in the palate or in the roots of the molar teeth, and it becomes purulent and breaks out and a fistula comes from the flow of pus, and you have treated this without effect, you should heat a cautery of a size to fit the fistula; then introduce it hot into the fistula opening; and continue the pressure with it hot until the iron, still hot, reaches the hollow and the extremity of it.

[] [3]
Do this once or twice over.

[] [4]
Then afterwards treat as we have mentioned until it heals.

When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat it with medicines and it is of no use, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose shape will be given later in such a way that you place a link on the tooth; and apply the hot cautery quickly inside, and hold your hand there until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth; then remove your hand and reapply the cautery as you wish; afterwards have the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it there for an hour and then spit it out.

The ancients said that for pleurisy one should make cauteries of birthwort root, and in this manner: take a long birthwort root, the largest that you can find, and let it be dry, and be as thick and as long as your fingers; and soak it in oil, and put it in the fire, and cauterize one cautery between the armpit and the neck, and two small cauteries a little descending on the part which is below the chin; and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, inclining a little behind; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another on the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the chest outside the cautery which is between the two shoulders; and do not press your hand, but do it lightly as if smelling.

[] [2]
 The Ancients mentioned a cauterization for cold pleurisy by means of the roots of the long birthwort, in this fashion: you take the longest you can find of the roots of the long dry birthwort, and of the thickness of one finger; dip this in oil and light it at the fire; then burn the patient with one cauterization in the space between the junction of the neck with the clavicle; and two small cauterizations below the jugular veins, inclining slightly toward the region below the beard.

[] [3]
And two big cauterizations above the nipples in the space between the third and fourth ribs; and two more between the fifth and sixth ribs, tending slightly toward the back; and another in the middle of the chest; and another above the stomach; and three more behind, namely, one between the scapulae and two on either side of the dorsal spine below the one between the scapulae.

On cauterization of the spleen.

Of which, one method is that you make three cauteries, or four, in a line along the length of the lamprey, following the pattern of the cautery of the liver that we have discussed before; and do not press your hand with all the cautery, and let the patient lie frequently on his back; and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery that has two prongs, as we have shown it in the dislocation of the shoulder; and lift the skin that is around the lamprey, where the patient's side is on the left, and let the elevation by which you lift the skin be parallel to the length of the body and the cauteries be across the width of the body.

[] [3]
One is to make three or four cauterizations in a row over the long axis of the spleen like the cauterization of the liver, a figure of which has been given above.

[] [4]
 Let there be between each pair of burns a finger's breadth or a little more.

When the hemorrhoids are in the anus, one or more, and are old and are from gross cold and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in divisions, and it is not effective, then make cauteries: three on the spine, the one that is furthest out below the shoulder blade little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the navel two fingers; and if you think that their stomach is chilled, and the food is not digested, and one sees swelling in the face, then make a large cautery on the stomach, as mentioned before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the key-shaped cautery; and leave the cautery open for a long time.

[] [2]
 When there are one or more chronic haemorrhoids in the anus arising from thick and cold humours or corrupt humidities, and they have been treated by those measures mentioned in the section, without effect, then sear the patient with three cauterizations over the lowest dorsal vertebra a little below the flat part of the back, triangularly; and one about two fingers' breadth below the navel.

 When a rupture occurs in the groin, and part of the intestine and omentum comes down into the scrotum, being the onset of the disease, forbid the patient to take food for one day and have him use laxatives to empty the bowel.

[] [3]
Then let him lie on his back in front of you and bid him hold his breath till the intestine or omentum comes out; then put it back with your finger.

[] [4]
Then, below the hernia over the pubic bone, mark a semicircle whose extremities point upward.

[] [5]
Then heat a cautery of this type.

[] [6]
When it is white hot and emits sparks then return the intestine or omentum into his abdominal cavity, and have an assistant put his hand over the place to prevent the exit of the intestine.

[] [7]
You should first have parted his legs and put a pillow under him; let another assistant sit on his legs and another on his chest, holding his hands.

[] [8]
Then apply the cautery to the mark, keeping the cautery upright, and hold it till it reaches the bone; or apply the cautery again a second time if it does not reach the bone the first time.

[] [9]
 You must take the greatest care that the intestine does not come out while you are cauterizing, lest you burn it and it result in death or grave injury to the patient.

[5] []
And the cautery for children must be small according to their size, and for adults, large according to their size; after three days treat the cauterized area with butter until the burning sensation is gone; then treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well closed; and his food should be easily digested for a long time, so that the intestines do not protrude when he gets up to go to the toilet.

[] [11]
For boys the cautery should be slender according to their proportions, and for adults according to theirs.

[] [12]
Then dress the site of the cauterization till it heals.

[] [13]
After three days, treat the site of cauterization with butter until the eschar from the burn departs.

[] [14]
Then treat with the usual ointments till healed.

[] [15]
The patient should lie on his back for forty days so that the wound may cicatrize.

[] [16]
Throughout the course of his treatment you must make his diet such as will be gentle with his inside, so that the intestine should not come down during the effort of defaecation.

[2] []
When you see it fit to cauterize, take note if the illness is at the beginning, and if it has been treated according to what we have said in the division, and it neither descends nor remains, and you fear that the corruption will take hold of the whole patient, then make five cauterizations on the head: one in the middle of the head at nine, and the other towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the occiput; and leave your hand there so long that the cautery reaches the bone, and so that the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape; and cauterize on the back according to what is written above.

[3] []
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere and it appears manifestly, you must cauterize it with these cauterizations that we have mentioned on the head, and one cauterization on top of the nose, and two cauterizations on the spine of the neck, and six cauterizations on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and another next to it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the breast, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the palms of the hands; and beware of the nerves that are on the heel, that you do not burn them; and sometimes one makes a cauterization on the pubic bone, and another on the breastbone, and another on the liver.

[] [3]
When you wish to use the cautery, first look, and if the elephantiasis be in the early stage and you treat it with those remedies advised in the section but it does not abate and is not arrested, and you fear lest the corruption spread over the patient's whole constitution, then give him five cauterizations on the head: the well-known one in the middle of the head; the second one lower than that, toward the forehead, about the edge of the hair; and two at the temples; and one behind, on the nape of the neck.

[] [4]
And maintain the application of the cautery a little while till a slight mark is impressed on the bone and the outer table is removed from it, that there be an easy exit for the thick vapours.

[] [5]
Burn him also one cauterization over the spleen itself in the manner described earlier.

[] [6]
If the elephantiasis be widespread over the patient and appears obvious, you should give him, as well as the cauterizations described for the head: one at the end of the nose; two over the cheek bones; two over the cervical vertebrae; six over the dorsal vertebrae; a great one over the coccyx by the last vertebra of the tail; another above that on the flat of the back; two over the hip joints, one on either hip; two on the knees, one on either knee; two over the shoulders; two on the elbows; and two on the upper part of the breast; and burn him once on each joint of his fingers and toes, and on each ankle and on each forearm.

[] [7]
Be careful not to burn the posterior tendons of his heels.

[] [8]
He may also be cauterized once on the pubic bone; another on the cardia of the stomach; and another on the liver.

And if they are turned outwards on the body, and often this happens on the hands and feet, then you must apply cautery with hot water; and it is done in this way: take a tube of copper or iron, or a vaulting rib, and place it over the corn and the wart, that is to say, verrucous warts; and place the tube over it so that it surrounds it completely, then put in a little hot water, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the tube reaches the root of the corn, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root; and let the patient endure the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it like that, and it will uproot itself completely with all its roots. 

[] [7]
If the corns are not inverted, which usually happens on the surface of the body and particularly on the hands and feet, you should take a cannula made of bronze or iron or made of a vulture's quill, and place it on the corn or wart; then pour into the cannula a small quantity of caustic solution; keep your hand on it and rotate it, keeping up a slight pressure so that the edge of the cannula impresses a mark at the root of the corn and the caustic makes its way to the root of the corn.

Let the patient endure the action of the caustic for a while, then remove it; for the corn may be drawn out with its root.

[] [1]
On the cure of hydrocephalus.

[3] []
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew every day so much that he could not support it; and the fluid grew so much that he died, and this fluid had collected under the bone on the membrane, between the brain and the bone; and the procedure is as follows if the fluid is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you make a wide incision in the middle of the head; and let it be as long as two nuts, so that the fluid flows; and here is the form of the spatula:

[] [5]
I have seen a child whose head was filled with fluid and daily growing in size, until the child could not sit upright on account of the size of his head, and the humidity increased till he died.

[] [6]
Now this humidity sometimes collects between the skin and the bone; sometimes it collects beneath the bone and over the membrane.

[] [7]
The operation is thus: when the humidity is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, an incision should be made in the middle of the head, transversely.

[] [8]
The length of the incision should be about two thumb-joints, so that the humidity may flow out.

[] [1]
On the extraction of the temporal arteries.

[6] []
For cautery helps to dry out moisture: therefore it is of greater use for moistures.

[7] []
Or, for the extraction of arteries, it is necessary to fill the place with old cotton and put well-made tents on it; and when they are removed, it should be treated with dry medicines that promote flesh growth, and with tents, until it is healed; and if blood flows from the artery while you are working on it, hasten to cauterize it, or fill the place with vitriol and press it with your hand so that the blood is stanched; and if you do not have that available, put your finger on the place until the blood clots, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the bleeding stops, and compress it as needed; and what is better and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vessel with this cutting cautery on both sides, but the blades should be quite thick to retain their heat longer.

[] [10]
It is in fact better, as we have said, unless the patient is feverish or of a hot constitution; cauterization is one of the means of eliminating humidities, so it will be of surer efficacy.

[] [11]
After extraction of the arteries the place must be packed with teased-out cotton wool, and on top of that must be put firm pads.

[] [12]
And after loosening the ligature, dress with dry medicaments that encourage growth of flesh, and with bandages,, till it heals.

[] [13]
But if arterial bleeding hinders you in the course of your operation, hasten to stanch it either by cauterization or by filling the place with vitriol, compressing it with your hand till the blood stays; or, if you have nothing of this kind by you, put your finger on it till the blood clots and rinse over the place till the flow dies down; then tie off as you should.

[] [18]
If they have a certain thickness in them the heat of the fire will be retained in them and they will speedily cut the flesh.

[] [19]
This operation is superior to all and less severe and easier.

Let the distance between the two blades be the breadth of a finger.

And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous until what is visible of the flesh, and then do the same in the middle incision until the other side; and then draw blood evenly, and squeeze the area because of the collected blood; then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and ensure that no hot abscesses develop; and on the third day untie the bandage, and administer a large amount of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which one treats wounds, until it is healed.

Then do the same from the middle incision to the third.

After a moderate quantity of blood has flowed, express the bits of blood-clot from the place and pack into each incision a pad of teased-out cotton wool.

Over all put a pad soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar and oil, lest an effusion occur.

But if not, try to extract it with a fine blunt hook slightly curved.

and administer incision of that grain.

[] [13]
Immediately afterwards sew up the incision and dress it till healed.

[] [14]
 If the object that falls into the ear is one of those grains that grow or swell, then try to extract it by the means already mentioned.

[] [15]
If it does not respond to your efforts to get it out, take a fine narrow scalpel like this and with it attempt to cut out whatever kind of grain has entered the ear.

[12] []
If it comes out by this, that is good.

[13] []
If not, take many stones the length of your finger, smooth and light, and heat them a little in the fire; and have the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and jump on one foot from the other side, and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear; and do not stop doing this from stone to stone until all the water comes out, and thus it all comes out; and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and set fire to the other end until most of the reed is burned; then do the same with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.

[] [20]
Sometimes the water is extracted by taking a reed or quill and introducing one end into the ear; then the other end is set alight till the greater part of it is burnt; then repeat time after time with more quills till all the water is got out.

[] [21]
Or else suck it out with a cannula as described for a stone.

[19] []
And it should be of silver or brass, narrow below with a small hole, and open above for distilling; and to press the distillation inside, use a well-made brass instrument for this purpose, and if you wish, take a razor and wrap cotton suitably around the point; then drop your oil or juice, and what you want of your medicines into the cannula, and the cannula should be in the ear; then insert the razor with the cotton, and press your hand gently until the oil is distilled into the cavity of the ear; and let the patient feel it inside, and the distillation should be slightly warmed by fire before being distilled into the ear; and make sure it is not too cold, because the medicine would not be as effective.

[] [28]
 The instillation of oils or drugs should be done with an instrument like this, as you will see; you make it of silver or bronze, narrow at its lower end, with a small perforation, and wide at its upper part.

[] [29]
If you wish, you may make the obturator which goes in the cannula of strong bronze; or, if you like, take a probe and wrap cotton wool tightly round its tip; then pour into the cannula oil, juices, or whatever of these remedies you want, with the cannula in the ear.

[] [30]
Then introduce the probe with cotton wool on it and press moderately until the oil is ejected into the meatus and the patient feels it enter.

[] [31]
Let that which you put into the ear first be slightly warmed at the fire; and be careful that it be neither very hot nor very cold, for the ear is not suited to bear that.

[3] []
And the way of the work is that the patient puts his head on your lap; and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity of exinach contained on each side, then put it on him; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle; then cut into the middle of the moisture with a scalpel, making a slit of this width, and let it not be larger than the wound that is made in bloodletting a vein; and cut the skin deeply until you come to the exinach; and in several instances exinach comes out of the slit, in the form of a piece of white fat. 

[] [5]
The manner of operating is for the patient to let his head rest in your lap.

[] [6]
Then you take a scrap of linen and prepare a pad of it.

[] [7]
Make it into a circle of sufficient size to enclose the whole of the hydatid on all sides, then place it on it and squeeze with your fingers on all sides, so as to gather up the hydatid in the centre of the circle.

[] [8]
Then in the middle of this humidity make a crosswise incision with a lancet, but do not let the incision be larger than that made for a venesection.

[] [9]
As to the depth, the skin should be incised right through till you come to the hydatid, which in most cases will come out from the incision, in the shape of a white piece of fat.

On the various methods of blepharoplasty.

[2] []
You must place the patient's head on your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it is turned out, that is good; if not, insert a needle with a thread through it; and let this be near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow near these hairs, and pull a thread over it with the eyelid, and turn it towards the surgeon; then cut in the part under the eyelid, under the extra hairs, with the spatumile (spatula/scalpel) cutting, from the large tear duct to the small one; then pull out the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and cloth under the eyelid, then mark on the eyelid a figure with ink, like a myrtle leaf, and yet it must be that the figure is according to the amount that you want to raise the eyelid which is divided entirely.

[3] []
And there are some who need a large amount of the eyelid cut depending on how softened the eyelid is; then cut with the spatumile (spatula/scalpel) along the two lines that you have marked, and start from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs about the thickness of a hair, then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the heart shape, then peel it all off; then join the two edges with a suture using a needle with a fine woolen thread, and wipe away the blood, and burn the excess threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substance if you want to do so; and if not, don't worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days; then treat the wound without stitching with drying and constricting agents, for the eyelid is raised by the healing of the wound and the joining of it, but the suture is better (as the ancients said), and this is work without fear; and there is another way: and that is that you mark the eyelid with a figure that is like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three hooks separated according to the form which is here:

[] [4]
 You should place the patient's head in your lap, then with your left hand turn out the eyelid.

[] [5]
Now if it thus becomes everted, good; otherwise introduce a threaded needle beneath the eyelid and pass the needle up; let that be near the hair itself.

[] [6]
Then draw the thread up with the lid and invert the lid with a probe; then make an incision on the inside of the lid below the superfluous lashes with the lancet, from the greater to the lesser angle.

[] [7]
Then draw out the thread and put beneath the lid a small pad of cotton or linen; then mark with ink on the eyelid the shape of a myrtle leaf.

[] [8]
The shape should be according to the amount you wish to raise the lid, and varies in different people.

[] [9]
In some cases you should cut away a fair amount in proportion to the ptosis but in others a smaller incision is enough; all this in due proportion to the extent of the ptosis.

[] [10]
Then with a scalpel incise over the two lines you have marked, beginning at the greater angle and going toward the lesser angle; and let one incision be close to the natural lashes, at a distance of about the breadth of a probe.

[] [11]
Then introduce a hook into one angle of the skin and peel it all off; then join the edges with a needle and a fine woollen thread and wipe away the blood; and stick the ends of the threads to the eyebrow with adhesive, if you like; but if you do not it does not matter.

[] [12]
Then let the suture and the threads remain for about three or four days, then dress.

[] [13]
If you like, you may leave the wound without suture and treat it with drying medicaments and styptics; then the eyelid will be lifted as the wound heals and comes together; but suture is better.

[] [14]
The Ancients mention this method of operating.

[] [15]
It involves some burden for the patient; but the operation is good and safe.

[] [16]
Yet another way of operating is to mark on the eyelid the figure of a myrtle leaf as we have described; then lift the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or joined thus.

[5] []
And if you are unable to hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with a thread in it, and insert it in the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the large tear duct, and the second thread near the small one, and gather the threads evenly between your fingers; then raise your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have marked, as we have described, then join the two edges of the wound by stitching, and treat it until it is healed; and if an abscess develops at your incision, soothe it with cerate and similar soothing ointments; and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelid are turned inward: you must then use what we have said about the incision; but the suture in both cases is more sophisticated.

[] [19]
But if you cannot conveniently hold with the hooks, take a threaded needle and introduce it into the middle of the marking; and put another thread through near the greater canthus, and a third thread near the lesser canthus.

[] [20]
With your fingers hold the threads evenly and then raise your hand evenly and you will raise up the whole of the marked skin as we have said.

[] [21]
Then bring the edges together with a suture and dress till healed.

[] [22]
But if in your incision, or the opening you have made, a swelling arises, then allay the swelling with wax and similar sedatives.

[] [23]
Sometimes the lower lid also has the lashes inverted.

[] [24]
For this you should use any of the methods we have mentioned: the incision and suture, and the operation by the actual cautery and by caustic. (

[] [25]
The operation by the actual cautery or caustic) is more effective, and easier on the patient, than incision and suture, (but incision and suture) is more workmanlike in either lid.

The procedure is as follows: you take a fine needle, and put a soft and fine silk thread in it; then join the ends and tie them subtly, and the length of the threads should be one palm long; then arrange another fine silk thread shortly in the eye (of the needle), and tie the ends of the thread; then have the patient put their head in your lap; and be near the sun so that the work is well-lit, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then insert the needle with the whole eye (of the needle) at the root of the adjacent hair, and make it pierce the eyelid quickly until you pull it over the natural hair; then pull the hair up to the eye (of the needle), and put that hair in the eye, whether there is one or two or three or more; then pull your hand until the hairs come out with the whole eye (of the needle) in the eyelid with the natural hair.

[1] []
And if the eye (of the needle) is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, then pull the eye downwards with all the thread that you have arranged there, until the eye comes out of the hole above and you see it by the vision of the eye; then pull the eye and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair takes root in its place and the flesh grows over it; and if the hair is short, attach a long hair from the natural hair, and let it be raised with the one where you leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.

 If it be one or two hairs the operation will be to take a fine needle, thread it with a fine smooth silk, bring the ends together, and knot them with a tiny knot; the thread should be about a span in length.

[] [3]
Then in the loop insert another fine thread, shorter than the first, and join the ends with a knot if you wish.

[] [4]
Then let the patient put his head in your lap in full sunlight, so that the operation may be clearly seen, because it is very fine work.

[] [5]
Then introduce the needle with the loop to the root of the superfluous hair and run it quickly through the eyelid till you make it come out above the natural hair.

[] [6]
Then draw the thread to the top of the loop and introduce that hair into the loop if it be one, two, or three, but not more.

[] [7]
Then draw away your hand with it until the hair emerges with the loop on the eyelid among the natural hair.

[] [8]
If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, you draw the loop down by means of the thread which you have previously passed through it, until the loop comes out at the upper perforation.

[] [9]
Then put the hair back in and draw them both up; keep on until the hair rises up in the upper perforation and you can see it.

[] [10]
Then extract loop and thread and take them both out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days till the hair be fixed in its place and there is regeneration of flesh over it.

If the hair be short, put with it a long natural hair so that it may be raised together with that; or let the hair grow till it reach a greater length, then raise it.

And if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, that's good; if not, then take a scalpel and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid, and make two incisions in the side inside the eyelid; and the ends of the two incisions should be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and make an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the figure of a letter called "Greek I"; then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its sides are sharp underneath, following the eyelid, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a woolen thread; then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines, and with tents, until it is healed.

[4] []
And if the illness comes from a fissure or a suture or cauterization, then you must make a full incision under the hairs of the eyelids, and according to what is described above; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and one should perform the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master devises a plan with all his power how to return the shape to its natural form; and the patient himself, according to what is necessary in terms of work and instruments with various arrangements.

[] [6]
But if not, take a probe and put it on the site of the incision and with it turn back the lid.

[] [7]
Then make two incisions on the inner side of the lid; the two incisions should begin from the angles of the incision already made and run together making an angle so that when they join they are like this.

[] [8]
It is the Greek letter lambda.

[] [9]
You remove that flesh in proportion as the angled side is lower than that adjoining the lid; then bring the divided parts together with two sutures made with a woollen thread.

[] [10]
Then treat with the relaxing medicaments and dressings we have mentioned, till healed.

[] [11]
But if the inversion is acquired, from incision, suture, or cautery, you should make a simple incision below the eyelashes, as has been described, then bring apart the two edges with a packing, as we have said.

[] [12]
The sum of what there is to say about the treatment of inversion, whether it is in the upper or the lower lid, is that you should make your procedure follow the actual lines of the inversion itself ; for this is of varying shape.

[] [13]
The experienced practitioner will make use of his skill in any way he can to re-establish the natural form or approximate to it.

of the sudden [problem/ailment/swelling] of the eyelid

[1] []
When this adhesion happens to some men in such a way that the upper eyelid is stuck to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the point of a scalpel under the eyelid, and lift it up; and stretch it with tweezers, until you cut what is stuck with a thin spatula, which is not too sharp or too cutting, so that the patient can tolerate it and the too sharp spatula does not injure the eye; and make your incision, where you peel off this adhesion, lightly, so that the eyelid returns to its natural shape; and this whole adhesion is healed, and they sometimes put salty water in the eye, and rinse it with fresh water, and with an eyewash; then put a linen tent between the eyelid and the eye, and put wool soaked in egg white on the eye; and after the third day use the eyewash and healing things until it is healed.

 CHAPTER FIFTEEN.

[] [1]
On adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.

[] [2]
 This adhesion happens to many people, the upper lid sticking to the white of the eye and hindering its movement and preventing its natural functions.

[] [3]
You should introduce the end of a probe beneath the lid and raise it upward; or stretch it with a hook.

[] [4]
Then cut the adhesion with a fine scalpel; it should not be so sharp as a cutting scalpel, but somewhat blunt, lest during the operation the patient should shake, and the scalpel slip, and the edge injure the eye.

[] [5]
Let your incision be as if peeling off the adhesion.

[] [6]
Wait until the lid regains its natural shape and the adhesions be wholly healed.

[] [7]
Then rinse the eye with saline and cleanse it; or instil into it drops of a watery solution of eye-lotion of verdigris.

[] [8]
Then separate between the eye and the lid with a linen pad and put over the eye a piece of wool moistened with white of egg; and after the third day employ healing eye-lotions till it is better.

 CHAPTER SIXTEEN.

[] [1]
On incision of ungula and excrescence of the canthus.

[2] []
And the manner of the incision is as follows: the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail (pterygium) with tweezers with a slight twist, and stretch it upwards; then take a needle, and put in it a horsehair, or a cowhair, or an oxhair, and a strong thread; and bend the point of the needle a little and stick it in the middle of the nail (pterygium), and pierce it through with the needle, and tie the nail (pterygium) with a thread and stretch it upwards, and peel off with the hair the side of the nail (pterygium) that follows the pupil and the white of the eye up to the end, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula and with little force, and leave the natural flesh in the tear duct, so that the flow of tears does not become habitual through the incision; and sometimes the nail (pterygium) is stretched with a hook only, and with the thread, as we have said; then it is peeled off with the spatula gently in this way:

[] [4]
This is the method of incision: the patient places his head in your lap and opens his eyes; then you raise the lid with your hand; then with a gently curved hook pick up the ungula and pull it upward; then take a needle threaded with a horse hair or an ox hair, and a strong thread; slightly curve the end of the needle; then thrust it into the middle of the ungula, piercing it with the needle; and tie the ungula with the thread and pull upwards; and, with the hair, peel the side of the ungula adjoining the pupil, and divide it with a sawing motion right through.

[] [5]
Then what is left in the root of the angle cut out with a fine scalpel, or with small scissors; and leave the natural caruncle in the canthus lest, in cutting it away, a chronic flux of tears occur.

[] [6]
The ungula may be drawn out with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, and scraped away with the smoothtipped scalpel of this form.

of the flesh that grows on the pupil

[1] []
In the eyes of some men sometimes grows a red flesh, and covers the pupil and presses on the eyelids and turns them outwards, and resembles a pomegranate blossom; and the procedure is that the patient puts his head on your lap, then you open his eyes, and lift all this flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it firmly; then cut the first flesh, and keep cutting with the scalpel until the end, and be careful not to injure the eye in the process; and let the incision be with the spatumile that we mentioned in the incision of the pterygium and with small forceps with which one removes the speck, as the diagram after this chapter demonstrates; and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt or instill red eyewash and similar corrosive medications, and place on the outer eye cotton with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess; and if anything remains, and the hot blood overcomes you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess; then return to your work until it is healed, and do so whenever flesh is added to the eye in this way.

 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.

[] [1]
On cutting for chemosis and superfluous flesh in the eye.

[] [2]
 Sometimes in the eye of certain people a red granulation grows up and increases so as to block the pupil or nearly so; or it grows over the eyelids and often turns the lids outward, and it resembles the blossom of the pomegranate.

[] [3]
You operate for this by having the patient put his head in your lap; then he opens his eyes and you gather up the granulation whole, with suitable hooks, or hold it with tweezers or forceps.

[] [4]
Then you cut away the first bit of flesh and then the next, until you have cut it all away; and beware of damaging the eye in the course of operation.

[] [5]
Your incision should be made with the scalpel which we described for the incision of pterygium; or with small scissors like those with which one gathers up pannus, as shown in the chapter after this.

[] [6]
And when you have finished your incision and removed all the chemosis, fill the eye with powdered salt or instil the red powder or similar corrosive; and apply to the outside of the eye cotton wool with white of egg to ward off an abscess.

[] [7]
If there is any chemosis left and blood is getting the better of you and you fear an abscess, then desist and treat the eye with those means for settling a tumour.

[] [8]
Thereafter return to your operation till cured.

[] [1]
On gathering up pannus from the eye.

[] [13]
This is a figure of the scissors. [

[] [14]
The principle in the operation is that the eye be opened with double or triple openers held by a skilful pupil, the patient's head being in that pupil's lap, while another wipes away the tears and carefully watches the internal and external angles of the eye.

[] [15]
You have the choice between beginning the removal from the top or from the bottom of the eye.

[] [16]
The best method is to fix two hooks in the upper side, one at the end of the iris and the other at the beginning of it.

[] [17]
Hold them between your middle and first fingers.

[] [18]
Then attach hooks below the points of the first two, and hold them between your third and fourth fingers.

[] [19]
Raise your hand slightly until you see that the whole pannus has been lifted.

[] [20]
Then cut from the lesser angle, with scissors or a fine scalpel, as you wish.

[] [21]
Introduce the scraping-needle and cut away the entire pannus until it is lifted over the conjunctiva.

[] [22]
Do not interrupt the wiping, for tears and blood will flow and hinder you.

[] [23]
Then cut with scissors what is left over the iris, from above and below, until nothing remains adhering except over the cornea.

[] [24]
If you can remove it from over the cornea, peel with the scraping-needle, for it is better, and in some cases is easily done.

When you cut it, its ... will come out for some days].

On turning a fistula into the nose.

[4] []
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the swelling is healed, and remains so for 40 days, and it does not reappear and is not abscessed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed; if not, there is no other way than to bring the fistula back to the opening of the nose according to this form: and that is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered take a drill according to this form, and let the head be iron with three angles, and the shaft be thinned down to the head as you see here:

[] [10]
And if the place heals and flesh is generated there and the flow of sanies is stayed and there is no return after leaving for forty days, and there is no swelling, and nothing emerges, you may know it is perfectly healed.

[] [11]
But if not, there is no other means for it but to turn the fistula into the cavity of the nose, in this style, namely, that you lay bare the bone a second time, either by an instrument or by caustic; and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill like this.

[] [12]
Its extremity, which is of iron, should be triangular; and its wooden handle should be conical in shape, and, as you see, tapering to the extremity.

of the discharge from the eye

[1] []
When the eye opens completely, and there is no disturbance or diminishing in the nose, then you must bind the patient; then clean it, then apply cupping glasses or a cupping horn without scarification to suck, then put on the eye a plaster made of acacia and aloe and frankincense and sarcocolla, and then compress the eye, and cover the plaster with bandages and cloths; and the manner of the cloths is that you take fairly soft cloths, and fold each in four, and then put one on top of the other according to the quantity that the eye requires; then tighten them over with a hard bandage firmly, and repeat the cupping glasses to suck without scarifying; then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye compressed day and night, and if the plaster softens, you must tighten it considerably; then remove the plaster after the day and night, and if you see the eye improving, it is good; if not, repeat the plaster and the cloths and the bandage and the cupping glasses until it is healed.

 When the whole eye is prominent and there is no reduction or impairment of vision, you should get the patient's bowels open.

[] [3]
Then venesect him in the cephalic vein; then apply cupping vessels to his neck without scarification and draw off by gentle suction; then put to the eye a poultice made of acacia and aloes and olibanum and sarcocolla; then bandage the eye over the application with many pads.

[] [4]
The way to make pads is to take a number of soft rags and fold each into four thicknesses.

[] [5]
Prepare a good many.

[] [6]
Then put them one on top of the other as the eye requires; then bind on stiff bandages over these, tying them firmly.

[] [7]
Repeat the cupping with suction and without scarification.

[] [8]
Then take away the cupping vessel and leave the eye bandaged a day and a night.

[] [9]
If the bandaging slackens during that time, it must be tied properly.

[] [10]
Then remove the bandaging after a day and a night, as we have said.

If you see that the eye has receded, good.

Otherwise repeat the applications and pads and bandages and the cupping till it does recede.

of the rupture of the uvea

[1] []
When a disruption occurs in the uvea, then it opens, and pus comes from the eyelids like a grain of resin, and it is frightening to see; then if you see fit to cut it, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the lower part up to the upper one, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear duct; and make it pierce through, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement; then cut the place of the double thread and tie a part of the uvea around it, and tighten it well, then pull out the needle and put on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed; and sometimes the wound is restrained by the uvea on each side of a circle of cloth, until it is healed.

 When a rupture befalls the uveal membrane so that it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids looking like a grape, and on this account the man's features are disfigured; if you intend to cut it away the operation will be as I am about to describe.

[] [3]
You introduce a needle to the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper segment; then you introduce another needle threaded with a double thread, from the region of the canthus major where you will perforate it; and leave the first needle in its place.

[] [4]
Then cut the place of doubling of the doubled thread, and with it ligature that part of the excrescence around the needle and tie it well.

[] [5]
Then remove the needle and apply to the eye wool moistened with egg-white; and leave till the thread falls away with the growth.

[] [6]
Then treat the eye with fortifying dressings till the wound be healed.

[] [7]
Sometimes the uvea is tied all round with a circle of material so that the prominence of the eye is greatly increased.

of the swelling of the eye

[1] []
This disease which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling that has gathered in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not water; and the manner of the appearance of the procedure is that you have the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take his head in your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the swelling come to the top before your eyes; then it should be pierced, so that it doesn't descend and the light is unobstructed, and the patient sees things as he used to; and if it doesn't descend, know that it is water, and if the descent of the swelling is not as we have described.

 This disease which is called 'hypopyon' is a collection of pus in the eye which resembles cataract but is not so.

[] [3]
The method of operating in this disease is to make the patient sit upright on a chair before you.

[] [4]
Take his head on either side with your hands and shake it about till you can see the pus come down; then it will be fixed and not move; and the light will pass and the patient will see things as he was before.

 CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE.

[2] []
You should have the patient sit between your hands, crossed, away from the sunlight, and tie up the healthy eye and squeeze it very tightly; then place the eyelid in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right; then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right; then place the point of the instrument next to the corona about the thickness of a hair in that white part of the eye at the part of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" skillfully, and twist your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and you feel the almagda reach the empty space; and it is necessary that the length of the almagda's path be at the depth of the measurement of the space which is from the pupil down to the end of the blackness; and that is the corona of the eye; you will see the bone in that eyelid because of the clarity of the cornea, and then place the instrument up to the place where the water is, then express it from one path after another.

[] [3]
You should cause the patient to sit down cross-legged before you, facing the light in full sun, and firmly bind up his sound eye.

[] [4]
Then lift up his eyelid with your left hand, if it be the left eye in which the humour is; or with the right hand if it be the right eye.

[] [5]
Then take the couching needle in your right hand if it be the left eye; or in your left hand if it be the right eye.

[] [6]
Then put the tip of the needle near the corona, about the thickness of a probe away, onto the white of the eye itself, on the side of the lesser canthus.

[] [7]
Then thrust the needle firmly in, at the same time rotating it with your hand, until it penetrates the white of the eye, and you feel that the needle has reached something empty.

[] [8]
The depth the needle goes in should measure as the distance from the pupil to the edge of the iris, which is the corona of the eye; you will see the metal in the pupil itself because of the transparency of the corneal tunic.

[] [9]
Then put the needle up to the place containing the humour; then press the point downwards time after time.

[8] []
And then pierce the conjunctiva only, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle place, then put the almagda there, as we have said; and at the completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable sleeping place, where they may sleep on their back in a dark place; and let them be free from all movement, and take light food, and not move their head neither to the right nor to the left, and be bound according to their disposition until the third day; then unbind them in that same dark room, and test their sight, and make them see certain things, and then replace the bandage until the seventh day; and you must not do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but you must delay this, because the fluid rises quickly.

[] [16]
With this make a perforation in the conjunctiva only, not piercing any further; for that is only to make a little entrance for the needle.

[] [17]
And then thrust in the needle as we said before.

[] [18]
 At the end of your operation, prepare a solidly-built bed on which the patient may lie on his back, in a dark room; and keep him from all movement or coughing.

[] [19]
And prescribe such a diet for him as will relax his system; neither let him move his head to right or to left.

[] [20]
Let the bandage remain in the same position till the third day.

[] [21]
Then loosen it in the same dark room and make trial of his sight, putting before him objects to be seen; then replace the bandage till the seventh day.

[] [22]
You should not do this at the time of treatment nor immediately after the perforation by the needle; but on the contrary you should avoid it, for intensive use of the eye causes a rapid ascent of the humour.

[12] []
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them; and let them be properly made of brass:

of the flesh on the nose

 CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR.

[] [1]
On the treatment of nasal polyp.

[4] []
If the nose opens, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed; and if moisture does not flow as it should, know that flesh has grown on the bone above, which the instrument cannot reach to cut: then you must insert a somewhat thick linen thread, knotted with many knots, and having between each knot a space of a finger or less; and have the patient put the end of the thread into his nose as far as he can, and pull while inhaling until it comes through the nose into the mouth; and children in schools often do this, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it; then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other, pulling on the knots that are in the thread.

[5] []
Do this until you know that the knots have broken down that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and soak the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back into the nose as before; do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh; and then put a lead tube in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if there is need for drying medications, use them; and this is the form of the instrument for cleansing the head, with which oils and medications are distilled into the nose:

[] [9]
But if fluid does not pass through it as it should, you may know that there is a polyp within in the upper part of the ethmoid bone where the instrument could not reach to make incision.

[] [10]
In this case you must take a linen thread, rather thick, and tie many knots in it with a space of a finger's breadth or less between each pair of knots; and let the patient try to get one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or anything he can, after making it into the form of a button; and let him make a full inspiration till it reaches the cartilage and comes out through the throat.

[] [11]
Boys at school often do this sort of thing, and it is quite easy for anyone who wishes.

[] [12]
Then hold together the two ends of the thread, one coming out through the mouth and the other remaining in the nose; then saw off the polyps by means of the knots in the thread ; continue doing this till you are sure that the growth has been cut off by the knotted thread.

[] [13]
Then take out the thread and, after wiping away the blood, put into the nose a plug dipped in Egyptian ointment.

[] [14]
Do this for three days or longer till the ointment has consumed the remnants of the polyp.

[] [15]
Then, last of all, insert a lead tube in the nose for a few days till healed.

[] [16]
If he need treatment with drying medicaments, use them.

 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE.

[1] []
Often a disease arises at the tip of the nose which is called "telul," and it grows and becomes increasingly large, until it is an unsightly thing to look at; and therefore you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it all away, then put the cautery or burning medicine on the spot; and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take note if it is hard, dark-colored, with little sensation: do not touch it with iron for it is a cancerous growth, because when it is sometimes cut, great harm comes to the patient; and if the growth is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that it can all be cut out, then have the patient fast and cut it without fear, and treat the area with drying and astringent things.

[] [2]
 There frequently spring from the end of the nose warts that grow and increase daily till they disfigure the man.

[] [3]
So you should cut them out when they first appear; totally eradicate them and apply to the place cauterization, either actual or by caustic.

[] [4]
But if excision of them has been overlooked till they have grown big, then examine, and if the growth is stone-like, hard, and pale in colour, and with little sensation, do not interfere with it with an instrument, for it is a cancerous tumour.

[] [5]
For I have often seen people cut these tumours, and great affliction resulted to the sufferer.

[] [6]
But if the tumour be soft to the touch, not pale coloured, and you see it can be wholly removed, then purge the patient, and cut it off him fearlessly, and treat the place with astringents and styptics till healed.

It is therefore necessary when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it is healed; and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, then you must scrape all the parts of their core until they bleed, then bring the two lips together with a suture, and tighten it, and sprinkle on powder of dragon's blood, and ground incense; and put on the powders a piece of strong plaster or other binding plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.

When such a thing happens to anyone, look carefully, and if the wound be fresh and bleeding, bring the edges of the wound together with a suture, and dress them till they are healed.

If the discontinuity has separated the edges, and both edges have healed, it is necessary to scrape both edges on the external skin till they bleed; then bring the edges together with a suture and dust over it dragon's blood and olibanum; and put over the powder a plaster of Palm ointment or some other of the regenerative ointments, and leave bandaged for two or three days; then unbandage and change the medicine, and let the sutures come away of themselves; and afterward dress with ointment till healed.

And beware not to do as the ignorant healers do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the jaw, and do not employ what we have described; but sometimes cause, because of this, great illness due to the roots that remain, or because of the jaw that they break, as we have often seen; and when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and salt; and if bleeding occurs there, which often happens, fill the area with ground vitriol; and if that is not effective, cauterize it.

[] [12]
Take care not to do those things that the ignorant barber-surgeons do in their rashness and haste in dental extraction, neglecting to employ the methods we describe.

For they often bring great troubles upon people, the least of which is to break the tooth off short, leaving the whole or part of the root behind; or to remove the tooth together with a piece of the jaw bone, as I have often seen.

When the front teeth become loose, either by a blow or by falling, and the patient cannot press on what he eats without them falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and that is of no use; then they must be secured with a gold thread, because silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes; and let the thread be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth; and if you want to straighten the teeth, take the thread and put it doubled between the two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you come carefully down to the healthy tooth on the other side; then repeat the wrapping up to the part where you started, and tighten your hand subtly and carefully, so that it does not move at all; and let your knot be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.

On interlacing loose teeth with silver or gold wire.

[] [2]
 When the front teeth are loosened by some blow or fall and the patient cannot bite upon what he is eating lest they fall out, and you have without avail treated them with styptic medicines, the technique in this case is to bind the teeth with gold or silver wire.

[] [3]
Gold is the better, for silver oxidizes and corrodes after some days, but gold remains for ever in its state and does not suffer this change.

[] [4]
The wire should be moderate in thickness in accordance with the distance between the teeth.

[] [5]
The method is to take the wire and run it doubled between two sound teeth; then with the two ends of the wire you weave between the loose teeth, either one or several, until you bring your weaving to a sound tooth on the other side; then you repeat your weaving back to the side whence you began; tighten it gently and judiciously till they do not move at all.

[] [6]
You should tie the wire at the root of the teeth lest it slip.

And if you see it of a dark color or black or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is cancer; and if it is tending towards white, and there is moisture, then put the hook there, and split it with a fine spatula, and free it on one side and the other; and if the blood overcomes you in your work, apply ground vitriol until it is stanched, then return to your work until you draw out all the fire (infection/inflammation); then wash the area with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.

The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth in the full light of the sun and inspect the tumour.

[] [4]
If you see that it is dark or black, and hard, and the patient has no sensation in it, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer.

[] [5]
But if it is inclined to be pale and has fluid in it, put a hook in it and incise it with a fine scalpel and free it all round; and if haemorrhage hinders you while operating apply pounded vitriol to it till the bleeding stops.

And let it be sharp on one side, and not on the other; and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, the patient should gargle with warm water, and water and vinegar, and if bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate peels have been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it until it is healed; and sometimes other abscesses grow in the throat besides the two tonsils, so cut them in the same way as the two tonsils.

[] [14]
And when one tonsil has been cut away, remove the other in exactly the same manner.

[] [15]
Then after the excision let the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.

[] [16]
But if there occur a haemorrhage let him gargle with water in which have been boiled pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves or similar styptics till the haemorrhage is stanched; then treat till healed.

[] [17]
Sometimes there grow in the fauces tumours other than the tonsils; remove them just as described for tonsils.

[9] []
I hurried then at once, and inserted a hook into one, then pulled it out, and drew out a large amount of pus; then I did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed down her tongue; afterwards I inserted the hook into the abscess, and cut a part of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the woman's throat passage was opened, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not stop cutting at this abscess for a long time; and the abscess kept growing back, and filling the place that I had emptied, until it was very large again; then I devised a plan and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it stopped growing; and I left those parts, and I do not know what God did with her after me.

[] [21]
So I made the utmost haste and, fixing a hook in one of them, drew it forward, and out came a sizeable piece.

[] [22]
Then I cut it off where I had hold of it near the nostril.

[] [23]
Then I did the same with the one projecting from the other nostril.

[] [24]
Then I opened her mouth and depressed the tongue; then fastened the hook in the tumour itself and cut off a part of it, with only a little haemorrhage; and the woman's pharynx was freed and immediately she had a drink of water, then took some food.

[] [25]
And from time to time, for long after, I continued to cut away this tumour.

[] [26]
But fresh growth continually replaced what was excised till we both grew weary of it.

[] [27]
Then I went about it astutely and cauterized the tumour high up in the throat, and it stopped growing.

Then the woman left the district and I do not know what God has done with her since I had charge of her.

And the manner of the cautery is with sharp water. (Or: And the type of cautery is sharp water.)

[9] []
And it should have a small bowl at the tip where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula; and the patient should be lying on their side, so that the saliva and mucus runs from their mouth along with the medicine inside, so that it does not go down the throat and injure it; then hold your hand with the medicine and press it onto the uvula, for about half an hour, until you see it numbed and the burning of the medicine has subsided; and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around an instrument, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with the cotton in the mouth, so that the cotton burns onto the uvula; and do this frequently, until the cauterization is complete, then leave it to dry, and it will fall off after four or five days. And if you need to repeat the cauterization with the medicine, then repeat it, and after the cauterization wipe around the uvula with cotton dipped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine; and it should be rinsed with cold water, and treated with gargles until it is healed. 

[] [12]
The end of it where you put the caustic should have a hollow like that of the spoon of a spoonprobe.

[] [13]
With the patient lying on his side, letting the mucous secretions flow from his gullet out of his mouth so that none of the corrosive may run down his gullet and cause harm, you place the instrument right on the uvula.

[] [14]
Then, steadying the hand that is holding the medicament, press it out on to the uvula for the space of half an hour until you see the uvula turn black and the corrosive action cease.

[] [15]
If you wish, you can take some cotton wool twisted on the end of a probe, and, having soaked it in the caustic, apply the probe with the wool, down through a cannula till the wool sticks on the uvula.

[] [16]
Do this over and over again till you have done all the cauterization you want, then let be; for it will shrink and fall off in three or four days.

[] [17]
If you need to repeat the treatment, do so.

[] [18]
After the cauterization, wipe all round the uvula with wool soaked in butter, and with that mop up all the caustic remaining round about it.

[] [19]
Then let him rinse his mouth out with cold water and do you treat with external embrocations, and gargles within, till he is well.

Many times a bone or fishbone, or some other thing, gets stuck in the throat; so you must remove what you can see, and press the tongue down with the instrument, so that you can see the object move; and what you cannot see and is stuck in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the stuck object will come out through vomiting; or the patient can swallow a piece of sponge, or a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it reaches the spot, it will stick, and then you pull it out; and if it does not come out with what we have said, then take a lead instrument shaped like this:

 There often sticks in the throat a bone or fish-bone or something else.

[] [3]
After you have depressed the tongue with the instrument in the full light of the sun, so that what is stuck in the throat is made as conspicuous as possible, you should then remove whatever can be seen and comes into view.

[] [4]
But when it is not visible to you, and lies hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food in his stomach is digested, for often the object comes out with vomiting.

And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot with live coals in it, and the pot should be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in this hole should be the head of the instrument; then throw your fumigation in it, and the patient puts the end of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech; and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation many times; and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and bitter things, and do not drink water; and then it will be necessary for it to come out by this treatment.

[] [8]
In fumigating, this is the way to set about it: take a pot containing live coals, fitted with a lid and a hole in the middle of the lid into which is fitted the end of the instrument.

[] [9]
Then put in the aromatic; and the patient should apply his mouth to the end of the cannula, with his mouth closed to prevent the escape of the vapour, until he knows that the vapour has reached his throat; for the leech will at once come away.

[] [10]
But if it does not come away, let the inhalation be repeated many times.

[] [0]
 CHAPTER FORTY.

[] [1]
A general dissertation on the perforation and incision of tumours.

[7] []
And you must know the time for the perforation of the abscess that is ripe according to maturation, and that is when the pain is appeased, and the fever subsides, and the lessening of the pain and redness, and of the throbbing and the pointing of the head of the abscess, and the other signs; and you must make the perforation in the most dependent place of the abscess, and where it appears soft; and the perforation should be along the body, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in the joints and near the nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no bending.

[8] []
In those that bend, according to the limb.

[] [13]
 It is necessary too to know the time to open fully mature swellings: it is when the pain of the swelling is lessened, the fever departs, the redness and the throbbing are reduced, and the head of the abscess becomes wrinkled, with other signs.

[] [14]
The perforation should be made in the lower part of the swelling if possible, so that the pus may more easily drain downwards; or else in the thinnest and most swollen part of the swelling.

[] [15]
Your incision should be longitudinal if the swellings are in such places as hands or feet or in the site of joints, tendons, nerves, or arteries; and, in short, in all flat places where there is no curvature.

[] [16]
In curved places let the perforation proceed according to the place.

[12] []
And you should make small openings in small abscesses; and in large abscesses, large openings, and many incisions according to the size of the abscess; and there are some such abscesses where you must shave the core, and cut; when it has become like a rag, and is dead, it must be done as with buboes: and there are some that are cut in three angles, and some that are cut like a myrtle leaf, such as abscesses of the groin; and there are some where a round cut is made, and other cuts and similar incisions.

[] [20]
In small swellings you should use a single perforation; while in large ones you should use wide or multiple perforations according to the size of the swelling.

[] [21]
There are also some swellings that need a circular incision of the skin, and should be cut when they have become like a rag, and necrosed —which actually happens often in abscesses and sinuses.

[] [22]
And there are some that should be incised triangularly; and others with an incision of myrtle-leaf form; e.g.

[] [23]
a tumour on the groin.

[] [24]
There are others again to which should be applied circular and lunate and similar incisions.

[] [31]
Then remove it and treat with the needful ointments until healed.

In the one that you find has a good disposition to the touch, and is similar in color to the body, and moves freely in every direction and is not attached to the nerves of the neck nor to the artery nor to the trachea, and is not deep; you should cut it from above, and peel it back on all sides, and spread the two edges of the wound with hooks, if you need them, as we have said for abscesses of the head; and pull it little by little, and be certain that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and the spatula must not be sharp or pointed, lest the hand slip, and it not go too far, so that you do not cut what you should not.

[] [5]
But those that you find by touch to be benign and are of a colour not greatly differing from the skin, freely movable in any direction, not adherent to the nerves of the neck nor to a jugular vein, nor to an artery, and are not deep-lying; these should be incised with a simple incision from above downwards, from line g to line b

[] [6]
 and dissect away all round and draw the edges of the skin apart with one or two hooks or with several if necessary, as we said on the subject of tumours of the head, and draw them out very slowly.

[] [7]
Be most careful not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve.

[] [8]
The scalpel should not be over sharp lest you make the incision too big, or the patient flinches and so you cut open that which does not need cutting.

And the accidental is of two kinds, of which one is similar to a fatty knot, and the other kind is similar to an abscess that comes from a knot of an artery; and there is danger, and one should not operate with iron except in the one that is small, and test and examine it with a probe: if you find it like a fatty knot, and it is not attached to any vein, then cut it, as one cuts knots, and pull it out with its entire covering, if there is any; and examine everything carefully, and treat it as appropriate, until it is completely healed.

[] [5]
The acquired is of two kinds: one resembles a sebaceous cyst, the other resembles the tumour arising from an arterial aneurysm, and it is dangerous to incise it, so on no account must you apply a knife to the latter kind, except any that are small; if you try and explore them with a probe and you find they are like sebaceous cysts and not adherent to any blood-vessel, then immediately cut down upon them as you would a cyst and remove them with whatever capsule may surround them, if they are contained within a capsule; and if not, dissect away the whole accurately; then treat the place with suitable remedies.

They are made round, polished, and smooth, like packing-needles, of Chinese copper or of white copper, or of brass, silver, or iron.

[] [15]
The best are those made of white copper.

[] [16]
Sometimes probes are made of black lead, for investigating fistulas whose deeper course is devious; so that by reason of their softness they can adapt themselves to the curves.

[] [17]
Of these, too, there are three varieties: the long, the medium, and the short, proportioned to the requirement of the depth of every fistula.

[] [18]
Their thickness also should be proportioned to the width or narrowness of the fistula.

The heads of these with which one cuts are sharp, and some of them cut only on one side, with which one peels nodes, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve; and of these probing instruments are the lancets placed in handles, so that the patient does not perceive them at the opening of abscesses; and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see; and one does not use them except in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and the groin, and in similar places; and sometimes one makes another small instrument, resembling nutcrackers, according to this form, with which one stops blood:

[] [27]
And there are the bent hooks with two prongs, of which there are three kinds.

Figure of the small scarifying scalpel.

[] [41]
The cutting edges should be sharp, and the other ends blunt.

[] [42]
The reason for making them like this is so that they can be utilized in dissecting away cysts where there is a fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and also that the patient may console himself thereby and find some small relief from the pain involved in the dissection of a tumour.

[] [43]
Here are the figures of the 'deceivers' of which also there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.

[] [44]
They are made of brass and resemble the rod for instilling eye-salve.

[] [45]
At one end there is the likeness of a broad spoon made of two plates, in the extremity of which is the point of a hidden scalpel; thus the knife is masked like a bird's tongue, moving in and out at will, as you see.

[] [46]
Figures of the scalpels which are hidden between the fingers when tumours are to be opened, so that they are not noticed by the patient.

[] [47]
They are of three varieties: large, medium, and small.

[] [48]
 Figures of the cupping vessels with which haemorrhage is stanched.

[] [49]
There are three kinds: large, medium, and small.

[] [50]
 They are made of bronze or of Chinese alloy, round but slightly elongated, as you see, and also rather thin.

[] [51]
You should have these kinds by you, large and small, so that haemorrhage may be quickly stopped in an emergency and when you have no medicine.

[] [52]
But they are not to be used for suppressing haemorrhage in all parts of the body, but only in the fleshy parts such as the calf and thigh muscles, the arm muscles, the breasts, belly, and groin, and other similar fleshy soft parts.

[] [53]
Sometimes of this class small instruments, like nutshells, are made, like this.

then peel away the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitching, and treat it until it is healed; and if the breast hangs down, and is softened by its size as happens with women, then cut it into two sides above, by two similar incisions; of which one joins the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line .b. up to line .g.; then peel the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply there what we have said about stitching and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed; and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the bleeding, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.

[] [4]
But if the breast is pendulous and flabby on account of its size, as happens with women, you should make two semicircular incisions on the upper side, the ends joining one another, in such wise that the longer incision encircles the other like this, from b to g. Then dissect away the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat and sew up as we have described; and apply styptic powder and the necessary dressings until healed.

[] [5]
But if you cannot make the incision as full and perfect as it ought to have been, because the patient is restless, or because haemorrhage arises, you should pack the wound with cotton wool soaked in corrosive ointment and leave till it eats away the remainder of the fat; then dress until healed.

It is therefore necessary to avoid the use of iron instruments, and to also avoid the one at the top, and in the case of swelling from a ruptured artery, make an incision along the length of the skin above; then open the cut with hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues until it is exposed; then insert a needle underneath it, and push it through to the other side, and tie off the artery with a double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples; then prick the place between the two ligatures with a lancet so that the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is drained; then apply treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off; then treat this with a suitable ointment until it is healed; and if the abscess is due to a cut in the vein, you must hold in your hand as much of the abscess as you can along with the skin, then insert the needle under the part you are holding, and push it through, and have a double thread there, so that you pull it to the other side; then tie off the abscess, as I have told you, by tying one of the two sides with the two ends of the thread; and if you are worried that the thread might come out, insert another needle with a thread underneath the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tie the threads in four places; then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess flesh and leave what is tied; then place a cloth soaked in wine and oil on top, then apply treatments of tents and ointments until it is healed.

[] [5]
It is dangerous to make an incision on tumours of this kind, specially in the axilla, the groin, the neck, and in many other parts of the body; it is indeed highly dangerous, so in these you must avoid treatment by the knife; also in those in the limbs and in the head it must be avoided.

[] [6]
But any such that arises from the inflation of the mouth of an artery, you may cut down in the skin over that with a longitudinal incision; then open up your incision with hooks and dissect away the artery, freeing it from the tissues till it is laid bare.

[] [7]
Then run a needle beneath the artery to reach the other side, and tie the artery in two places with a double thread, as I showed you for the extraction of the temporal arteries.

[] [8]
Then with the scalpel prick the part between the two ligatures to let out all the blood and get the tumour down.

[] [9]
Then apply dressings to excite suppuration until the ligatures fall away; then dress with suitable ointments until healed.

[] [10]
If the swelling be due to a vein that has been penetrated, you should gather up with your hand as much of the tumour as you can, together with the skin; then pass a needle beneath the place which you have grasped in your hand and run it through, threaded with a double thread, until it emerges at the other side; then with it tie a strong ligature round the swelling as I mentioned to you on ligaturing the swollen uvula, from either side, with the ends of the thread.

[] [11]
If you fear that the threads may come loose, pass a second needle and thread beneath the whole tumour to intersect with the passage of the first needle; and tie your threads in four places.

Then incise the tumour in the centre to extract the contents.

And this occurs most often in the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in many cases without pain; and when it is pressed firmly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin; and it moves easily in all directions, and goes neither forward nor backward, neither below nor above, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with an iron instrument: perhaps contraction would occur; and the one that is on the head or forehead, incise the skin with a spatula.

[] [3]
This occurs mostly at the wrists, at the heel, and at all sites of articular movement.

[] [4]
It is a hard tumour of the same colour as the rest of the body, and is generally painless, and when strong pressure is put upon it the patient has a numb feeling in it.

[] [5]
It is a tumour that does not form in the deeper tissues but is subcutaneous.

[] [6]
It is freely movable laterally, but will not go forward or backward.

[] [7]
Those that are situated on joints should certainly not be tackled with the knife, for that often causes palsy.

[] [1]
On the amputation of warts occurring on the belly.

[3] []
For during cutting, excessive bleeding often occurs, and if the blood overcomes you, then hurry to cauterize; and if you see the patient frightened and afraid of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead wire, and tie the growth with it as we have said, and leave it for two days; and then tighten it, and do not stop tightening the lead wire until it cuts through the growth, and it falls off by itself without difficulty; and if the roots are thick, be careful when cutting, especially in the abdomen, but you can certainly cut half of it, then cauterize it so that it does not return; then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the thelul that is pale in color and weak in appearance and milky in aspect. 

[] [8]
But you should also have at hand cauteries in a fire; for often in amputating them there is much haemorrhage.

[] [9]
So, if the bleeding be a hindrance to you, be quick and cauterize them.

[] [10]
On the other hand if you see that the patient is frightened and dreads the cutting of them with the scalpel, take a wire of stout lead, and ligature this type of wart and leave for two days.

[] [11]
Then increase the stricture by the lead wire and go on doing this as it sinks into the wart, until the wart is cut through and spontaneously falls away with no trouble.

[] [12]
But if the warts have stout pedicles there is some risk and fear in the cutting of them, especially those that occur on the belly.

[] [13]
Sometimes, however, you can cut away the half, or some part, and then cauterize to prevent recurrence.

[] [14]
Then dress until the wound is healed.

[] [15]
 But beware of trying to cut away growths that are dark in colour, with little sensation and hideous in appearance, for they are cancerous tumours.

when the intestine comes out

[] [0]
 CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO.

[6] []
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and lie stretched out straight, then mark with ink all around the swelling; then have them lie face down between your hands, then go around the place that you marked with the spatula, then stretch half of the abscess above with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or with a cord of strong silk firmly, and the knot of the tie should be loose; then open half of the stretched abscess above the tie, and insert your index finger, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught in the tie, untie it, and push the intestine back inside the belly; and if you find the bowel, take it with the hook, and cut off the excess; and if the artery or vein gives you trouble, proceed carefully around it, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads in them, and put the two needles across what you have done in a cross that you make pierce; then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and shave the abscess as we have said; and remove the blood or fluid that you find, then treat the area as appropriate, and suture the area.

[] [9]
But if it be due to bowel or omentum, bid the patient hold his breath and stand stiffly upright; then make an ink mark all round the umbilicus; then tell him to lie on his back before you; then with a broad scalpel cut all round the umbilicus along the line marked out; then draw up the middle of the tumour with a large hook; then ligature the site of the incision with a strong thread or silk cord, tying it securely with a slip-knot.

[] [10]
Then open the middle of the tied tumour above the ligature and insert your forefinger and search for the bowel; and if you find it caught in the ligature slacken the slip-knot and push the bowel back into the abdomen.

[] [11]
But if you find omentum, stretch it with a hook and cut off what is superfluous.

[] [12]
And if you come across an artery or vein, tie it securely and go on with your work: take two needles and thread them with two strong threads and insert the two needles into the incision that you have made around the tumour, pushing them in so that they cross one another.

[] [13]
Then ligature the tumour in four places over the needles.

[] [14]
If you wish, you may remove the needles and let be until the ligatured tissue necroses and falls away of its own accord; or cut it away when it is thin and necrosing.

[] [15]
Then dress with the needful ointments until healed.

[] [16]
But if the prominent navel be due to an overgrowth of flesh there or from humidity, you should slice the tumour as we have said and get out all the blood or humidity to be found there.

[] [17]
Then dress it with stimulating dressings.

of the canker/ulcer

[1] []
We have spoken in the division about the appearances of a canker/ulcer, and how one should work on it with medicines, and how one should avoid treatment with iron; and we say the canker/ulcer generates in the marrow, and there is great caution in its treatment, and the ancients said that when a canker/ulcer is in a place where one can scrape it, such as a canker/ulcer that is on the breasts, and on the thigh, and in similar places, one should remove it completely when it is in the beginning stages; and when it is large and old, you should not approach it, for I have never been able to heal one; nor has anyone ever healed one before me.

[2] []
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you sometimes purge the patient of black bile; then bleed them if they have obvious plethora, then prepare a good place for the patient to do the work; then cast your hooks onto the canker/ulcer, and shave it from all sides, and remove it entirely without leaving anything; and let the blood run freely, and squeeze the area well with your hand or with something, and if the flow of blood from the incision of the artery or vein hinders you, cauterize it until the blood is stanched; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.

[] [3]
We also mentioned the cancer arising in the uterus and gave a warning against its treatment.

[] [4]
The Ancients said that when a cancer is in a site where total eradication is possible, such as a cancer of the breast or of the thigh, and in similar parts where complete removal is possible, and especially when in the early stage and small, (then surgery was to be tried).

[] [5]
But when it is of long standing and large you should leave it alone.

[] [6]
For I myself have never been able to cure any such, nor have I seen anyone else succeed before me.

[] [7]
The procedure in a case amenable to treatment, as we have said, is first for the patient to be purged several times from black bile; then bleed him if his veins seem full.

[] [8]
Then put the patient in the most convenient position for operating.

[] [9]
Then attach to the tumour hooks suited to it; then make a circular incision all round to include the skin with the utmost thoroughness so that not the least root of it remains; let the blood flow and do not stanch it quickly; but put pressure upon the place and squeeze out all the thick blood, either by hand or with any instrument you can.

[] [10]
If in operating you get a very severe haemorrhage from cutting an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops; then dress in the usual way until healed.

of dropsy/edema

[1] []
We have already spoken in the division about the appearances of dropsy/edema, and in what manner the collection of water is made, and the signs of each type, and the treatment that is done with medicines, and that which is treated with iron: so is only eclites (a type of dropsy); and one should not touch with iron these two types: namely, tympanites (abdominal swelling) and yposarche (another type of dropsy), for it is a mortal thing; so when you treat this type of dropsy/edema which is called "eclites" with medicines, and the treatment is not effective, consider if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy/edema, such as a cough and loose bowels and similar things; do not touch it with iron, for there is danger; and if you see the patient is of strong constitution, and they have no other illness than dropsy/edema only, and they are not too young nor too old, you should proceed as follows: lift the patient straight up on your hands, and an assistant presses the belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the abdomen, then take the pointed scalpel according to this form:

 CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR.

[] [1]
On the treatment of dropsy.

[] [2]
 We have mentioned in the section the kinds of hydrops, and the manner in which the fluid collects; the signs of each kind; and the medical treatment of them.

[] [3]
The only kind which is to be treated by operation is the one called 'ascites'.

[] [4]
But neither the kind called 'tympanites' nor general anasarca are to be treated by operation at all, for that would be fatal.

[] [5]
When you have been trying medical treatment for this kind, for ascites, and your treatment is ineffectual, then consider; and if the patient be in a low state or suffer from other disease beside the ascites, such as cough or diarrhoea or some such, then beware of attempting operative treatment since it will be of uncertain outcome.

[] [6]
But if you see that the patient has plenty of strength and suffers under no other complaint beside the dropsy, and is of neither tender nor advanced age, then the operative procedure in this case is for you to place the patient, standing, before you, with an assistant behind him to apply manual pressure to his abdomen and push the fluid down into the pelvis.

[] [7]
Then take a pointed scalpel of this shape, sharp along both sides, long, and very sharp at the end like a scalpel, but slightly stubby so that in operating you do not reach the intestines and damage them.

[] [8]
Then consider; and if the dropsy arises from the region of the intestines then you should make an incision three fingers' breadth directly below the umbilicus, above the pubes.

[] [9]
If the dropsy arises from disease of the liver, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the umbilicus.

[] [10]
If it arises from disease of the spleen, let the incision be three fingers to the right.

[5] []
at the top is the wing, so that when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately descends onto the instrument; then empty half or a third, for if you empty more than necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the release of their spirit or soul, or they will faint, or they will approach death; but empty it according to the amount of their strength, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's strength indicate, and their pulse; then withdraw the instrument and retain the water, and it is held back now by the core which plugs the hole that is on the superficial fascia, of which I spoke, that you pierce in this manner; then reinsert the instrument the next day, if you see the patient tolerating it, and draw out a small amount of water; do this for a few days, and be careful not to drain so much that there remains no more than a little water. 

[] [15]
When the instrument reaches the fluid, the fluid will at once pass down into it.

[] [16]
Evacuate at one time only a moderate amount of fluid; for if you evacuate more than you should at a time, the patient may die through a dissolution of his animal spirits, or he will undergo a fainting that is next door to death.

[] [17]
But let out such quantity of fluid as is proportionate to his strength and as is indicated to you by the patient's condition: the strength of his pulse and the goodness of his colour.

[] [18]
Then withdraw the instrument and keep (the rest of) the fluid in.

[] [19]
For it will be immediately held back by the skin that closes the opening in the peritoneum, which, as I have told you, must be perforated in that manner.

[] [20]
Then repeat the use of the instrument another day if you see that the patient can tolerate it, and withdraw again a small quantity of fluid.

 CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX.

[] [1]
On pustules occurring on the prepuce and on the glans; and blackness and necrosis and adhesions between glans and prepuce.

[6] []
The cautery helps with both conditions: namely, bleeding and corruption; and if the head of the penis is corrupted and retracted, you must insert a lead tube into the urethra, and the patient should urinate through it; and when the skin is tight at the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or where it occurs because of a wound or an abscess, then you must peel it back with a blunt instrument, until the ligament is released, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides; and if it is difficult to separate this, you must peel it back with a spatula a little from the head of the penis and the skin; then gently separate the two, and place a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water between them, so that it does not become tight again. 

[] [12]
For the cautery serves a twofold purpose, namely against haemorrhage and for a putrefying wound.

[] [13]
If at any time the penis mortifies and goes entirely, you should pass into the urethra a leaden cannula so that the patient can make water.

[] [14]
As to the adhesion of the glans to the prepuce (which occurs in him who has his prepuce intact, being under no obligation to be circumcized; sometimes too adhesion may occur by reason of a wound or an abscess) you should scrape it with a flat-nosed scalpel until the adhesion is divided and the glans penis is freed all round from the prepuce.

[] [15]
But if the complete separation of the two be difficult then you should dissect away a little of the glans and of the prepuce; for the prepuce is thin, and consequently it is often pierced quickly.

[] [16]
Separate then between the glans and the prepuce with a piece of fine linen dipped in cold water to prevent further adhesions.

Then let it be dressed with some styptic wine till it heals over.

Then ligate the indicated place with a double ligature, and a second right round beneath; then take hold at the site of the lower ligature with thumb and forefinger, very firmly, and cut between the ligatures; then quickly push back the skin and draw out the glans penis; then let a little blood flow, for that is all the better and prevents the swelling of the tip of the penis; then wipe it with a piece of soft cloth, then sprinkle on it ashes of dried gourds (this is the best of all that I have tried) or else fine white flour, which is also good; then apply on top of the powders a piece of linen with egg-yolk cooked in rosewater, beaten up with fresh oil of roses of good quality.

Leave this on the wound until the following day; then dress it in the usual way till healed.

They should be fiat-nosed, sharp, with no bend in them, and with the pivot tempered ; and the length of the handles should be equal to that of the blades.

 CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT.

[1] []
Urinary retention is due to blockage by a stone, or by clotted blood, or by swelling, or by dead flesh, or by similar things, which we have mentioned in the division; and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone that is stuck in the neck of the bladder, then the patient must be bent over his knees; and his feet should be placed on his back, and he should stretch his belly from above his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is forced to expel the stone upwards, which releases the urine; and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called "syringe," which has this form: it should be of thin silver, lightly capped, like the feather of a bird; and the tube should be a palm and a half long, and thin at the end.

[2] []
And the method of releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the end, and insert the end of the thread into the syringe; and cut off the excess wool and push it to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and sprinkle the bladder and penis with warm oil and olive oil and lukewarm water; then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the base of the penis, then bend the penis over towards the belly; then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it reach the empty space, and this is not done according to this order except because the duct through which it goes is twisted; then pull the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine will follow the wool, then pull it out, and let the urine flow; and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.

[] [2]
 Retention of the urine is caused by an obstruction, from a stone or a clot of blood or pus or a fleshy tumour, or similar cause.

[] [3]
When you have carried out treatment in the ways we have prescribed in their place and the urine is not released; and when you see that it is held back by a stone sticking in the neck of the bladder, then you should have the patient down on his knees, squatting; then mount a man on his back to press his abdomen against his back; and let the patient himself hold his breath as tightly as possible; for then pressure will be put on the neck of the bladder to force the stone back and liberate the urine.

[] [4]
But if these measures do not free it and the matter is very urgent with the patient, then you should attempt to bring it out with the instrument called a catheter, of which this is the figure.

[] [5]
It is made of silver, slender and smooth and hollow like the quill of a bird's feather; as slender as a probe; about a span and a half in length; and with a tiny funnel at the end.

[] [6]
This is the manner in which you draw off the urine through it: take a double thread and with a strong knot tie a little wool or cotton on the end, introduce the end of the thread into the lower end of the catheter, and trim off with scissors any superfluous wool, so that it will go into the tube and close it like a tassel.

[] [7]
Then smear the catheter with oil or butter or egg-white.

[] [8]
Make the patient sit down; then anoint the bladder and the meatus of the penis with humid oils or with olive-oil and warm water.

[] [9]
Then gently introduce the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra.

[] [10]
Then turn the end of the penis upward toward the umbilicus; then push the catheter inwards until the curve of the catheter ends, and push the catheter in until it reaches nearly to the seat.

[] [11]
Then turn the penis down, with the catheter in it, and push until it reaches the bladder, and the patient now feels that it has entered a hollow.

[] [12]
The reason why the operation is done in this manner is that the passage by which the urine is excreted is curved.

[] [13]
Then withdraw rather firmly the thread with the wool plug attached, for the urine follows the wool; then pull it right out and the urine will pour out.

[] [14]
Apply the catheter again and again until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.

[] [1]
On the manner of irrigating the bladder with a syringe, and the forms of the instruments that serve for that.

[2] []
It is closed, and it has three holes: two on one side, and one on the other, as you can see; and the capped place through which the medicine flows should be such that it tightly stops the penis without further additions, so that one can draw out the moisture, and insert it when necessary; and when you want to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the end of the catheter in the liquid, and pull on the plunger that is inside; you will draw the liquid into the catheter, and then push the plunger back in firmly; the liquid will enter and go into the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it; and this is the form of the thin clyster with which one irrigates the bladder: here it is:

[3] []
And it is made of silver or bronze, and the top is higher; and below it has a breast where the binding falls; then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you want to irrigate the bladder, then tie it tightly between the two breasts with a good double thread, and warm that liquid a little over the fire; then insert the end of the clyster into the penis, then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid evenly, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder; and if you don't have the bladder, take a piece of parchment, and make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around; then put a strong thread through these holes, then gather the circle as one gathers a bag, and put inside what you want of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument; and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.

[] [3]
It is made of silver or ivory, hollow, with a long fine tube, fine as a probe; entirely hollow except for the end, which is solid with three holes in it: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.

[] [4]
The hollow part containing the plunger is exactly of a size to be closed by it, so that any liquid is drawn up with it when you pull it up; and when you press it down it is driven in a jet, as is done by the projector whereby naphtha is thrown in naval battles.

[] [5]
So when you wish to inject fluid into the bladder, dip the end of the syringe into the fluid and draw up the piston, for the fluid will be drawn up into the cavity of the syringe.

[] [6]
Then introduce the end into the urethra as we described for catheterization; then expel the fluid by means of the piston; the fluid will immediately flow into the bladder and the patient will have a sense of its entry.

[] [7]
This is the illustration of a fine clyster also for irrigation of the bladder.

[] [8]
It is made of silver or white copper.

[] [9]
The upper part of it is like a small funnel and beneath it is a groove where falls the thread of the ligature.

[] [10]
Then take a camel's bladder and fill it with whatever fluid you wish to wash the bladder out with, and tie it to the syringe with a strong ligature of double thread between the two ridges.

[] [11]
Warm the fluid a little over the fire; then introduce the end of the siphon into the end of the urinary meatus.

[] [12]
Then apply strong pressure to the bladder containing the fluid until the patient can feel the fluid has entered his own bladder.

[] [13]
But if you have not a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and cut out a circle; then make holes in the edge all round the circle; then pass a strong ligature through these holes all round and draw the circle in, as a bag is closed with a draw-string, first putting into it whatever fluid, oil, or water, you desire.

[] [14]
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as with the camel's bladder, squeezing until the fluid reaches the bladder of the patient.

 CHAPTER SIXTY.

[2] []
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder occurs more often in children, and it is a sign that the liquid coming from the bladder resembles water in its clarity; and sand appears in it, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down often, and then becomes erect; and very often the base [of the penis] jumps/twitches; and the healing is easy in children up to four years old, and is very difficult in old men, and is moderate in young men, in those who are between youth and old age; and the cure is easier for those who have large stones, than for those who have small ones.

[] [6]
I shall now give a short description of this with a clear explanation and summary.

[] [7]
 Now I say that a vesical calculus most frequently occurs in boys.

[] [8]
Among the symptoms is that the urine passed out of the bladder is of a thin consistency like water, and sand appears in it; and the patient keeps on rubbing and playing with his penis; and often it hangs flaccid and then is erected; at the same time many of them get a prolapse of the rectum.

[] [9]
The cure of boys under the age of fourteen years is easy; but the treatment of old people is difficult; and that of young men midway between the two.

[] [10]
And the larger the stone the easier the cure; with a small stone the cure is otherwise.

[8] []
And cut between what is between the testicles and the anus, not in the middle but on the side of the left buttock; and it should be directly over the stone, and your fingers should always be in the anus, and the incision should be transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large; perhaps the finger that is in the anus presses it so that it jumps out without difficulty; and know that there are such stones where there are angles, and edges: it is difficult to remove; and there are some that are smooth, resembling an acorn, and round, which are easy to extract. 

[] [20]
The incision should be oblique, wide externally and narrowing inwards down to dimensions allowing the exit of the stone, not larger.

[] [21]
Now you may press with the finger that is in the anus upon the stone as you make the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.

[] [22]
You should know that sometimes there are stones which have angles and edges, on which account their extraction is difficult.

[] [23]
Some are smooth like acorns and rounded, and these come out easily.

[] [24]
But in those cases where the stone is rough and angular you should slightly increase the incision.

[] [44]
The purpose of the ligature beneath the stone is lest it return to the bladder; and the purpose of the one above it is that when you loosen the ligature after removing the stone the skin may fall back into place so as to cover the wound.

[] [45]
On this account, when you tie the upper ligature, you will have to raise the skin so that when you have finished operating it may go back and cover the wound as we have said.

 CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE.

[] [1]
On the extraction of a stone from the female.

[] [3]
But if it should happen to a woman the treatment is indeed difficult and is hindered by a number of things.

[] [4]
One is that the woman may be a virgin.

[] [5]
Another is that you will not find a woman who will expose herself to a (male) doctor if she be chaste or married.

[] [6]
A third is that you will not find a woman competent in this art, particularly not in surgery.

[] [7]
Then a fourth is that the place for cutting upon the stone in a woman is a long way from where the stone lies, so the incision has to be deep, which is dangerous.

[] [8]
If necessity compels you to this kind of case, you should take with you a competent woman doctor.

[3] []
If she finds it, she must move it little by little from the entrance of the bladder down until it comes to the groin; then cut down onto the stone in the groin opposite the middle of the vulva, where the muscle is softest, and feel the stone in that area; and do not move your finger from above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then insert the instrument into the incision, if you feel the stone then enlarge the wound until the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones: that is to say, small and large, and rough and smooth, long and round, and some that have branches.

[] [13]
But if the patient be not a virgin bid the midwife pass her finger into the vulva and palpate for the stone, after she has placed her left hand upon the bladder and applied a good pressure.

[] [14]
If she finds the stone she should gradually push it down from the outlet of the bladder as far as she can until it reaches the bottom of the pelvis.

[] [15]
Then she should cut down upon it from about the middle of the pudenda near the root of the hip on whichever side she can conveniently feel it; she must keep her finger on the stone, pressing from below.

[] [16]
The incision should start by being small; then let her introduce a sound into the small incision, and when she finds the stone then she will enlarge the incision until she knows that it is big enough for the exit of the stone.

[] [17]
You should know that there are many kinds of calculus: some are large and some are small; smooth and rough; long, rounded, and pronged.

[5] []
And if the bleeding overcomes you, apply ground vitriol to the area, and hold it for an hour until the bleeding has stopped; then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I told you about for the extraction of the stone in men to help you in your work; and if the bleeding overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, then apply the powder to the site and compress it with tents and bandages, and do not start this again, and leave the stone and do not pull it out, because perhaps the patient would die; then treat the wound.

[] [19]
If you are hindered by a haemorrhage, scatter powdered vitriol on the place and keep it there for a time until the haemorrhage has ceased, and then return to your operating until the stone is out.

[] [20]
See also that you have ready the instruments mentioned for the extraction of stone from the male, to assist you in operating.

[] [21]
If you are hindered by a haemorrhage and you know, by the spurting of the blood, that it comes from an artery that has been cut, then put styptic powder on the place and bind up tightly with bandages and leave it and do not come back to it; let the stone be and do not extract it, for often that loses the patient; then dress the wound.

And when we treat it with iron, the patient must be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body; then lay him on his back, on something a little high, and put many cloths under him; then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on the right, and stretch the penis to one of the two sides near the heart of the testicles; then take the milk-white spatula, and cut the skin of the scrotum through it lengthwise down near the penis, and make your incision perfectly straight, dividing the skin of the scrotum down to the white hydrocele, and peel it carefully according to your ability; then pierce the hydrocele full of water with a large hole, and extract all the water, and then insert your hooks, and stretch the hydrocele upwards; and do not touch the heart of the testicle, but only the hydrocele; cut it all or in pieces evenly along its side, carefully, because if you do not cut it skillfully, the water will return; and if the testicle comes out during your work, return it to its place when you have completed the work on the hydrocele; then bring together the two edges near the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like the other wounds, until it is healed.

[] [11]
 When we begin operative treatment the patient should be told to be venesected, if possible, if you see that he is of a plethoric bodily habit.

[] [12]
Then let him lie on his back upon something a little raised, and have a heap of material placed beneath him.

[] [13]
Then sit down on his left side, and bid an assistant sit on his right side and draw out his penis toward one side or other of the scrotum and toward the hypogastrium.

[] [14]
Then take a broad scalpel and make a longitudinal incision in the scrotum, from the middle almost to the pubes.

[] [15]
The incision should be straight, on a parallel with the median raphe of the scrotum, down to the tunica albuginea, and dissect away from it carefully lest you cut it.

[] [16]
You should dissect chiefly on the side where the testicle is most adherent, and take your dissection as far as possible.

[] [17]
Then open up the membrane containing the fluid with a wide perforation and draw off all the fluid.

[] [18]
Then with hooks separate the two edges of the incision and draw the membrane upwards but do not touch the skin overlying the testes; then cut away the membrane in whatever way is possible, either as a whole or piecemeal, particularly the side piece; for unless you use the utmost diligence in cutting it away you cannot be certain that the fluid will not come back.

[] [19]
If the testicle should protrude from its covering of skin while you are operating, return it when you have finished cutting the membrane; then bring together the two edges of your incision with a suture.

[] [20]
Then dress with the usual dressings for wounds until healed.

[] [27]
The ends by means of which it is attached should be made of cotton or soft wool and should be drawn tight at the waist of the breeches.

[] [28]
One of the ends you take over the seat toward the back: the second end you take toward the pubes, the two ends round the thighs below, and the remaining two ends over the groin, and the whole is bound up tight with the belt of the breeches.

[] [29]
This rupture may also be treated by cautery instead of surgery.

[] [30]
This will mean taking a knife-edged cautery and cutting with it the skin of the testicles; it should be hot, as we told you before, and used until the white membrane covering the hydrocele be exposed.

[] [31]
Then take another cautery of this type, which resembles the Greek letter tau; and with it perforate that membrane.

[] [32]
It should be hot so as to draw out all the humidity.

[] [33]
Then stretch the membrane with hooks, dissect away the capsule with the cautery and cut it away as best you are able until you have completely removed it.

[11] []
And if the patient is afraid, and does not want to endure this procedure because of its horribleness, then administer perforation, as I tell you, and that is when you are quite certain by the signs that we have described that a watery branch is there, have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with the broad spatula, and place the perforation along the length of the body; and let the hole be wide, so that all the water runs out; then put cotton over the place, and tie it, and leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound is healed; and if the white cloth does not let the water flow out at the opening of the wound, you must insert a feather or the instrument with which one draws water from dropsical patients, the form of which is shown above; and widen the wound a little, and know that the water will return, and collect again after six months or thereabouts, and when it is collected as before, the patient will thus spend his days.

[] [38]
When by the signs we have mentioned you are certain that the hernia is watery, you should seat the patient on a high chair and pierce the tumour in its lower part with a broad scalpel.

[] [39]
The perforation should run in the long axis of the body, and it should be an ample opening to let all the fluid run out.

[] [40]
Then put cotton on the place and bind it on and leave it so as to soak up the rest of the fluid; then dress the wound until it heals.

[] [41]
But if the fluid fail to flow out when the opening is made, which would be due to the tunica albuginea's obtruding into the opening and preventing the outlet of the fluid, you should then introduce into the wound a goose-quill or an instrument such as is used for ascites, already described; or else the opening should be widened a little.

[] [42]
But you should know that after six months or so the fluid may come back and collect again; when it does so, perforate him in exactly the same manner; so will the patient prolong his life.

That is to say, by an excess of sour and sharp [humor], which spreads to the testicles, or from a blow; and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and there is no pain, and it is a serious abscess; and sometimes an abscess is serious, dangerous and stony, and of a dark color, and sometimes it comes during the night from an artery, or from a swelling of a vein. 

[] [5]
It may be from an acrid superfluity running down into the testicles, or from a blow.

[] [6]
The colour of the tumour will be like that of the rest of the body and there is no water to it.

[] [7]
The lump will be solid and often will be stony hard, of a dark colour, and without sensation.

Sometimes also it arises from a knotting and inflation of the arteries, as has been mentioned, or from an inflation of the veins.

 CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR.

[] [1]
On the treatment of hernia with varix.

[2] []
You must have the patient sit on a raised seat, then lower the suspensory of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels that are near the penis, and have the assistant hold them and stretch them tightly; then cut with a sharp scalpel widely across near the vessels, until they are exposed, and then peel them back on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples; then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the growth has appeared, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, along the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted fluids; then treat the wound like the others where one removes rot, even if some vessel that nourishes one of the testicles falls off; for no harm comes from this, and if the growth comes to all the vessels, it is necessary to remove the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and they dry up and cannot be helped. 

[] [5]
So I begin by saying that you must have the patient sitting upon a high seat; then push down the suspensor of the testicles and take hold of the skin of the testicles with your fingers together with the blood-vessels near the penis; then let your assistant take hold instead of you and draw out strongly.

[] [6]
Then with a broad sharp scalpel make an oblique incision in the direction of the vessels so that the vessels are laid bare.

[] [7]
Then dissect on all sides in the same way as I told you for extracting the temporal vessels.

[] [8]
Then run through them a needle doubly threaded and tie at the spot where the varix begins and tie it again where the varix ends, then cut through the varix in the middle with an incision at right angles to the length of the body and draw out the turbid corrupt humidity that has gathered in it.

[] [9]
Then dress the wound with the wound dressings usual where you wish to encourage suppuration, so that the vessels nourishing the one testicle may perish; there is no harm in that.

[] [10]
But if all the vessels are varicose then you will have to remove one testicle with its vessels lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment through cutting into the vessels; for it will wither and be of no use.

of the rupture of the peritoneum

[1] []
The occurrence of this branch is by the tear that comes in the peritoneum, or the stretching over the belly in the area of the groin, which causes the intestines to descend from this rupture to one of the testicles; and this rupture is either in the peritoneum itself or in its stretching, and these two types come from many causes: either from a blow, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy load, and from similar things; and the sign when it is from the stretching of the peritoneum, is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the swelling is even down to the depths, because the peritoneum presses on the intestine.

[] [0]
 CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE.

[] [1]
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.

[] [2]
 This hernia is due to a split occurring in the membrane stretched from the hypogastrium over the belly in the region of the groin.

[] [3]
Through this opening the bowel descends upon one of the testes; this opening is due to the membrane's splitting or stretching.

[] [4]
And these two kinds occur from a number of causes: from a blow or jumping or shouting, or lifting a heavy weight, or a similar cause.

[] [5]
The symptoms of it, when it arises from a stretching of the membrane, are that it is a slow and chronic development and does not happen on a sudden, and the swelling is even and deep down, because the membrane is pressing the bowel.

[] [7]
Sometimes also the omentum comes out with the bowel, and this hernia is called intestinal and omental; sometimes it contains wind.

[5] []
And the method of the procedure is as follows: you instruct the patient to push the intestine back inside the wound with his hand, if he can return it; then he should be supported on his neck, between your hands, and lift his thighs; then stretch the scrotum upwards, and cut all the skin of the scrotum lengthwise; then insert hooks into the lips of the incision according to what you need to open the wound, and let them be such that the testicles can come out; then peel the peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum, until the white, hard peritoneum is uncovered on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the testicle, and between the second peritoneum, and separate that which is behind the testicle, and between the second peritoneum; and then move your right hand inside the scrotum, and stretch the white peritoneum upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle with all the peritoneum towards the incision; and instruct the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and untie that which is attached behind the ligament; and search with your fingers if there is any of the intestine wrapped in the white, hard peritoneum, and if you find anything, push it down into the abdomen; then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten strands, and insert it into the back part of the peritoneum, which is behind the skin of the scrotum; after the incision, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, so that there are four threads; then assemble them one on top of the other in the shape of a cross, and tie the peritoneum, which we have said is under the skin of the scrotum, with a strong ligature in two places; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them tightly in two places, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter into them, so that no hot swelling occurs there; and place another ligature in line with the first ligature, two fingers away from it, and after these two ligatures, leave the width of a finger of the peritoneum which is under the scrotum; and after all the other, following the roundness that the testicle bears; then cut in the part which is under the skin of the scrotum, until the blood flows, and the pus, as we have said previously; then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wounds, and apply the bandage that we have mentioned.

[] [10]
The manner of operating is to bid the patient reduce the bowel back into the belly if it be disposed to return, then lie back before you and raise his legs.

[] [11]
Then do you stretch upward the skin adjacent to the groin, and cut the whole length of the skin of the testicles; then attach to the edges of the incision as many hooks as are necessary to open the incision.

[] [12]
The incision should be sufficiently large to allow the testicle to be drawn out.

[] [13]
Then dissect away the tissues that lie beneath the skin of the scrotum so that the hard tunica albugínea be exposed all round.

[] [14]
Then introduce your forefinger in around the testis in the space between the white membrane beneath the skin of the testicle and the second membrane, and with your forefinger free the attachment at the back of the testicle.

[] [15]
Then with your right hand explore within the scrotum and fold back the covering of the testicles, at the same time stretching the tunica albugínea upwards with the left hand, and bring the testis with the membrane up into the opening, and bid your assistant to stretch the testis upwards; and do you fully free it from the posterior attachment.

[] [16]
Feel with your finger that there be no part of the intestine that has got twisted within the tough white membrane; and should you find any push it back into the abdomen.

[] [17]
Then take a needle with a stout tenfold thread and enter it near the end of the membrane which lies beneath the skin of the testicles alongside the rupture; then cut the end of the loop of thread to make four sutures and arrange one over the other in the form of a cross; and with these ligate the membrane of which we have spoken with a strong ligature on each side; then twist the ends of the thread and tie them with a strong knot to prevent anything from reaching the nutrient vessels of the testicles, lest an abscess occur thereby; and make also another ligature outside the first one, rather less than two fingers' breadth from it; and after making these two ligatures leave a finger's breadth of the membrane that is beneath the skin of the testicles and cut the rest away round, and with it remove the testis.

[] [18]
Then make a counter-incision in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, to let the blood and matter drain away as we bade you before.

Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place opens; and none of the intestines descend into the testicles, and if any descend, it is little, and returns all the time; and yet if it stays too long in this state, the wound or membrane grows, so that the intestines descend; and this happens by the stretching of the membrane which is in the groin, as we have said, for it is stretched, then the place is softened and swollen and opens; and the treatment is by cautery, as we have said before; and sometimes it is treated with an iron instrument in this way: the patient lies on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture widely to the extent of three fingers; and then extract the membrane which is under the skin that perspires, then take the thread and place it over the visible place of the membrane; and press it deep into the belly, then sew the two visible places of the membrane over the end of the thread, and sew both; then pull out the end of the thread, and do not cut the membrane or spread the egg or anything else, as I have told you in the treatment of intestinal hernia; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.

 CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN.

[] [1]
On the treatment of the rupture that occurs in the groin.

[] [2]
 Sometimes there occurs a rupture in the groin as we have said, and the part protrudes.

[] [3]
No portion of the intestine descends into the scrotum; or if anything it will be only a tiny portion and will reduce at any time.

[] [4]
But if it goes on for a long time the rupture in the membrane increases until the bowel and omentum descend into the scrotum.

[] [5]
It arises from a stretching of the membrane in the groin, as we said; the membrane stretches and then relaxes and the place swells.

[] [6]
Its treatment by the cautery is as I have already described.

[] [7]
Sometimes also it is treated with the knife in this manner: With the patient lying back before you, make an incision three fingers wide, transversely across the swelling of the rupture which projects.

[] [8]
Then perforate the subcutaneous tissues so as to expose the white membrane that lies under the skin alongside the rupture.

[] [9]
Take a probe and place it upon the projecting part of the fascia and push it back into the depths of the abdomen.

[] [10]
Then sew together the two swollen portions of membrane over the end of the probe and suture the one to the other.

[] [11]
Then take out the probe.

[] [12]
On no account make the incision into the fascia nor touch the testis nor anything else, as I taught you on the subject of treating the intestinal hernia.

[2] []
The membrane is constricted, and has no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is more moderate in this place, and closer to healing.

[] [14]
For the membrane will draw together and the rupture will not come out again.

[] [15]
But the cautery is better at this spot, for it is safer.

 CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT.

[1] []
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh inside is softened, and it is pale to look at; and it is necessary, when one wants to treat it, to make the patient lie on his back, and cut the skin which is softened over the natural skin; then bring the two edges together with a suture, and if you wish, first sew the excess of softened skin with three or four stitches firmly; then cut between the stitches, and treat it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.

[] [2]
 In some men there often occurs a loosening of the skin of the scrotum without any loosening of the organs within.

[] [3]
This has a horrible appearance.

[] [4]
He who desires to treat this condition should make the patient lie on his back; and he should cut away all the loose skin that is over and above the normal.

[] [5]
Then he should bring together the two edges of the incision with a suture.

[] [6]
Or, if you prefer, first suture the excess of loose skin together, with three or four stitches, and make the suture firm.

[] [7]
Then cut away what is taken up between the stitches.

[] [8]
Then dress the wound with the usual dressings till it heals and the stitches come away.

Of castration by cutting: you must hold the beast, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the spermatic cord, and cut on each testicle with one cut, when you have skinned them well; and leave some of the syfac and the thin syfac that is on the vessels; and this method of castration is better than the one done by pulling, because with pulling, perhaps some part of the testicles remains, which makes the beast desire lust; then treat the wound until it is healed.

[] [8]
As to castration by open operation and excision, the animal should be held and pressure put upon the scrotum with the left hand.

[] [9]
Then tie the spermatic cord and with one incision cut down upon both testicles so that both are brought up out of the scrotum.

[] [10]
After dissecting them away cut them off; do not leave any of the coverings upon them except the thin membrane covering the vessels.

[] [11]
This manner of castration is better than the contusion method, for contusion often leaves something of the testicles, and the animal desires to couple.

So you should get the woman into a cool place and then draw on the warts with forceps or catch hold with pieces of rough cloth, and cut them away from the roots.

Then if that cause a flow of blood sprinkle with one or other of the powders that stop bleeding but are not corrosive, such as acacia or dragon's blood or olibanum or the like.

Then raise her legs up against the wall for a while and then bring them down into cold water.

Then do not rush to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain subsides; and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where she leans, and supports her back and brings her feet together towards the lower part of the leg; and let her thighs be spread, and put her arms under her knees, and tie them well with a good cord; then have her lean slightly towards her right side, and apply the instrument used to open the mouth of the womb/uterus, the form of which follows below; and it is necessary that when you want to use this instrument, you first insert the probe to determine the depth of the womb/uterus, so that the part of the instrument that enters does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is too large, you must cover the depth of the womb/uterus with cloths, so that the instrument does not hurt her; and she must put the tube of the instrument above, and hold the instrument. 

[4] []
And when the abscess opens, and it is pressed by the soft hand, it must be lanced at the top, with a milk spatula; and when the pus is drained, you must put in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dried green oil; and place the tent outside the wound at the depth of the womb/uterus, and place over the womb/uterus and over the perineum clean wool soaked in water where mallows have been boiled; then treat it after two days with a suitable ointment, until it is healed; and sometimes the womb/uterus and the wound are cleaned with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water in which roots of lily and long birthwort have been boiled; then return to the ointment.

[] [5]
Then you should get the patient to sit in a chair having a double seat, lying back.

[] [6]
She should put her feet together upon her abdomen, with the thighs apart and the arms joined under the knees and bound together in a suitable manner.

[] [7]
Then the midwife should sit on the right side and employ the instrument for opening the orifice of the womb, which will be described later.

[] [8]
When you are going to use this instrument, you should measure with a probe the depth of the womb so that the instrument be not introduced beyond this measure lest the patient be harmed; if the instrument be longer, pads should be put over the rim of the cervix to prevent the passage of its whole length.

[] [9]
You must put the screw that runs in the instrument, in from the top and hold the instrument while your assistant turns the screw until the entrance of the uterus is opened.

[] [10]
When the abscess is exposed, and on manual palpation is found to be thin and soft, you should make an incision at its head with a broad scalpel.

[] [11]
And when all the matter is evacuated you should place on the wound a soft wick soaked in oil of roses or green oil with some styptic quality, and let it come outside from the incision into the cervix uteri.

[] [12]
Over the area of the uterus and pubes there should be clean wool soaked in an infusion of mallows.

[] [13]
Then after two days dress with a suitable ointment until healed.

Sometimes also both the wound and the uterus are washed out with a douche of honey and water, then of a decoction of liquorice root or long aristolochy; then go back to the ointment.

It is necessary first for the midwife that she recognize the appearance of a natural birth, and the signs are when you see the woman pushing downwards, and desires to smell things: then the child hastens to come out; then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and the exit is beneath its head, and the afterbirth with it; and when you see these signs, you must press gently on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly; for when it descends head first, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb/uterus is cleared of its excess fluids by a good cleansing; and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.

If you see the woman strain her abdomen and desire to breathe more air, and the pangs come easily to her and she hastens to deliver the child, by this you may know that the labour will follow a natural course and that the presentation will be vertex with the afterbirth, either together with the child or hanging by the umbilical cord.

And when you observe these signs it will be necessary to put pressure upon the abdomen to bring forth the foetus quickly.

 CHAPTER SEVENTY-SIX.

[1] []
When you treat a woman with a dead child in the womb, as I have said in the section, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to work by hand; you must know if the woman is of sound constitution, and does not have an illness where she fears death; the woman must be placed on her back, with her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised; and the assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled down with the descent of the child; then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mucilage of marshmallow and fenugreek and linseed, then let the midwife anoint her hands with these oils and these mucilages; then insert them gently into the womb, then find a place where she can insert the hooks that are suitable for this, and pay attention if the child is positioned to descend head first; insert the hooks into its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or in the fontanelle or near the temples, and if the descent is feet first, insert them in the heel and in the middle ribs; and she must hold the hook in her right hand, and place the curvature between the fingers of her left hand, and insert it with her whole hand gently, and insert the hook in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space; and this is the shape of the hook:

[] [2]
 When you have dealt with a dead foetus by those methods mentioned in their chapter, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to operate, you should examine to see if the woman be in a healthy state and not having any disease on account of which you might entertain a fear for her life.

[] [3]
The woman should lie on her back on a couch, her head tilted back and her legs raised.

[] [4]
An assistant on either side should hold her down firmly or she should be bound down to the couch, lest the body be drawn out of position in extracting the foetus.

[] [5]
Then the opening should be anointed with moistening oils and with mucilage of marsh mallow and fenugreek and with linseed.

[] [6]
Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages and gently introduce it into the vagina and with it locate a place in the foetus to fix hooks in.

[] [7]
The suitable places for that: consider, and if the foetus present the vertex then she should fix the hooks in its eyes or in the neck or in the mouth or palate or beneath the chin, or the collarbone, or about the ribs, or beneath the false ribs.

[] [8]
But if it present the feet let the hooks be fixed in the pubic region or middle ribs.

[] [9]
She should hold the hook in the right hand and put the curved part between the fingers of the left hand, and introduce the hand gently and fix a hook in one of the places before mentioned, driving it in until it comes to a hollow.

[5] []
And if the child's head is large and it is narrow at the exit, or if there is fluid collected in the head, you must insert the thorny spatula between your fingers, and pierce the head and extract the fluid; or you break it with the instrument that is called "almidach," whose form comes with the instruments in the chapter that is after this one; and do the same if the child has a naturally large head; and then pull out the bones with forceps, and if the head jumps out and is constricted at the fontanelle, let it be split, so that the moisture that is in the brain comes out; and if it cannot come out, cut it in pieces however you can; and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, you must pierce it so that the fluid runs out.

[] [16]
If the foetal head be large and it is tightly squeezed in exit, or if there be a collection of fluid in the head, you should introduce between your fingers a spike-shaped scalpel and split the head to let the water out; or you should smash it with the instrument called cephalotribe which will be illustrated, together with figures of the other instruments, in the chapter following.

[] [17]
In the same manner you act if the foetus have a naturally large head: either you should cut the skull open or smash it with the cephalotribe as we said; then you should draw out the bones with forceps.

[] [18]
If the head comes out and the foetus is held up at the collar bones, an incision should be made to let out the humidity in the thorax, for the thorax will then shrink.

[] [19]
But if the thorax does not shrink and is not disposed to emerge then you should cut off pieces in any manner possible.

[] [20]
 If the lower belly be swollen or dropsical then you should make an opening to draw out all the fluid.

[7] []
And if it is narrow at the belly or the chest, you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around the hand; and pierce the belly or the chest, so that the moisture that is there runs out; and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, let the midwife put her hand deep into the womb, and pull it down to the opening of the womb; then insert one or two hooks there, and pull it out; and if the opening of the womb is narrowed due to a hot abscess that has come there, you should not work on it, but rather administer moist and fatty things; and administer poultices to her, and sitz baths in softening and moisturizing water.

[] [22]
If it be stuck about the abdomen or thorax then pull on it with a cloth wound around your hand and cut an opening in the abdomen or thorax to allow the contents to flow out.

[] [23]
If all the limbs are removed but the head is turned backwards and is jammed, the midwife should introduce her left hand and, if the mouth of the womb is open, should put the hand into the cervix of the womb and investigate the head and, with her fingers, draw it down toward the opening and fix a hook or two in it, and extract it with these.

[] [24]
If it should be that the mouth of the womb is closed on account of an abscess, then one must not be rough with it but should use in this case instillations of moistening greasy substances; plasters also should be applied; and the woman should sit in a bath of softening and moistening waters.

[] [34]
So I investigated the place and got out many bones belonging to the head of the foetus.

On the forms of instruments necessary for extracting the foetus.

[] [2]
 Speculum for opening the entrance of the womb.

[3] []
Another form, similar but more slender and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, resembling tongs; and it has at the two ends two attachments, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide; and when you want to open the marrow with the whole instrument, have the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging and her legs open, then insert the two joined attachments into the marrow, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then open your hand with the whole instrument, as you did with the tongs similarly, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the marrow, until the midwife does what she needs to do.

[] [8]
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of forceps, but at the end it has two projections as you can see; and the length of each is about a span and the breadth two fingers.

[] [9]
When you wish to open the womb with this, make the woman sit on a couch with her legs hanging down, parted; then introduce the two projections pressed together into the orifice of the womb while you hold the end of the instrument lower down between her thighs; then open your hand in the same way as you would do with forceps, to the extent to which you wish to open the womb, so as to allow the midwife to do what she desires.

The former may be known by faeces or flatus coming out of them when the patient opens the bowel.

Often also worms come out of them.

[] [26]
Then treat with healing salve until healed.

[16] []
If you feel the tent, and between the two is the lining or the blind passage or flesh, or it is close to piercing, if there is no other way than a path of trust and hope, through the application of one of the three methods: either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, put tents there and treat it as before; and do not go too deep, so that you do not cut the tissue that holds the anus, and the excrement comes out involuntarily; then treat it as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it after it is cut next to the anus, either with a tent or another suitable instrument; then clean the diseased flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then work to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the anus: thus it will be an easier thing for the patient.

[] [33]
If you feel a barrier of flesh or membrane interposed between the probe and your finger, and it be nearly through, then there is nothing to be done except to try a remote hope.

[] [34]
There are three methods that you may employ.

[] [35]
The first is to cauterize it, as we have said.

[] [36]
Or you may cut it open until you reach the termination so as to be able to insert a dressing and bring the medicament into contact with it, but do not extend your incision too far lest you cut into the sphincter muscle and the patient become incontinent of faeces; then dress in the manner we have said and perhaps it may heal.

[] [37]
Or you may perforate the barrier and pierce it through, after incising to the vicinity of the anus, as we have said, either with the probe or with some other sharp-pointed instrument; then clear away the fleshy granulations in the incision as far as you are able; then attempt the repair of the whole wound with the incision and the upper opening, until it heals.

[] [38]
Let the inner end of the fistula remain open, for this will ease the patient.

of hemorrhoids

[1] []
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds: either they are inside the anus, like a grain of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they constantly bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the anus and at the end of the anus; but those that are outside have little moisture, and constantly leak a little yellow water or a little blood, and have the color of the body; and the treatment for those who have them inside the anus is that you instruct the patient to strain to go to the toilet, so that the anus protrudes, and the threads appear; then hurry, and grasp them with forceps, or hold them with your fingernail, then cut them at their roots; and if the hook cannot hold them because of their moisture, take them with a cloth, or with cotton, or with a piece of chamois; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and powder them with some hot powders that are in place of cautery; or you cauterize them as described in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed; and if the anus cannot protrude, give the patient a biting and harsh enema to wash what is in the anus, so that it can protrude clearly; when the patient strains, and if the threads are outside the anus, the treatment is easy; and that is that you take them with your fingernail or with forceps, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they fear the incision by iron. 

[2] []
You must administer the suture in this manner: take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread over and make the needle pierce the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide; and tighten the thread firmly, then knot the thread, and pull out the needle, and do so with all the others, and leave one to drain the excess blood; then put a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate on the anus, and put it on the anus, and instruct the patient to rest; and then leave it until they defecate, and when they have defecated, treat them with ointment and other treatments until they are healed.

Many times there is drying of feces in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use.

 CHAPTER EIGHTY-ONE.

[] [1]
On cutting and incising piles that are bleeding, and the treatment of fissures.

[] [2]
 Haemorrhoids are of two kinds: either internal, resembling red bubbles or grape-seeds, small or large, with blood perpetually flowing, and they may be single or multiple; or they may be external, round about the anus.

[] [3]
External ones are for the most part fairly dry; a little yellowish fluid or blood constantly oozes from them, and they are of the colour of the body.

[] [4]
 The treatment of internal piles: bid the patient open his bowel and bear down until the anus opens out and the swellings are disclosed to you; then quickly take hold of them with hooks or with your finger-nail and cut them off near the roots.

[] [5]
If the hook does not retain its hold on them because of their humidity and softness, then cut them with a piece of rough material or a rag of goat-hair, or draw them out with your fingers and cut them off; and after excision sprinkle some caustic powder on to act instead of the cautery; or cauterize them as previously described in the book on cauterization; then dress in the usual way until healed.

[] [6]
But if the anus will not open out for you then give a slightly corrosive enema so as to wash out what is within, and then, the anus will open out quickly when the patient bears down.

[] [7]
 Now the treatment of external piles is easy and simple: take hold of them with your finger-nails or catch them up with a hook and cut them away; and treat as before mentioned until cured.

[] [8]
 But with the patient who refuses excision with the knife, this manner of removal should be practised: thread a twisted thread into a needle, then draw the piles upward and run the needle through the root of each, from one side to the other, and wind the ends of the thread round beneath the needle as it lies crosswise, and bind the pile firmly; then knot the thread and remove the needle.

[] [9]
Do this with each pile, but leave one not destroyed so that the superfluous blood may flow from it.

[] [10]
Then apply to the anus a piece of material soaked in oil of roses or wax; apply it and bid the patient lie quiet; then leave him until the piles fall away.

[] [11]
When they fall away, dress with ointments and the usual dressings until healed.

[] [12]
The treatment of fissures: these often arise from dryness of the faeces and from constipation.

On the treatment of corns, inverted and otherwise, and dry warts and pimples.

[] [2]
 A corn is a round knob, the same colour as the body and resembling the head of a nail.

[] [3]
It occurs in all parts of the body but particularly in the soles of the feet and the toes, whence arises pain in walking.

[] [4]
You should cut away what is round the corn and take it with forceps or a hook and tear it out by the root; then dress it.

[] [5]
If you wish you may cauterize it in the manner already described in the book on cauterization.

[] [6]
Then concerning dry warts: a wart is a little round rough compact eminence on the surface of the body; it occurs often on the hands of boys.

[] [7]
Now the treatment is to draw out the wart and cut if off; or tie it off with a silken thread or a hair until it falls out; or if you wish, cauterize as said before, either with the actual cautery or with caustic.

[] [8]
Sometimes warts, inverted or otherwise, are uprooted with the instrument I shall describe under the treatment of pimples.

and there should be a separation where the bladder is tied, as you see, and the bottom be pierced within; and have two holes on one side, and one on the other; and the bladder where the medicines are placed should be made of an animal's bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and have a finger's width between each hole, then thread a strong thread of raw flax, twisted ten times or around, into these holes, and gather the bladder like a goat's udder; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then administer the clyster; and this is the form of the circle:

[] [7]
The lower extremity, which is introduced into the anus, should be closed and smooth, and on one side of it should be two holes, and on the other, one; the width of the holes should be about that of a probe or a little wider.

[] [8]
The membrane to hold the medicament is made out of an animal's bladder or of parchment, made up in the form of a small bag, a span in diameter.

[] [9]
It should be pierced with a number of holes in a circle a finger's breadth apart; and into these holes pass a strong thread of yarn, twisted of ten or so threads, and with this gather up the skin like a bag; and when the medicament is placed in it tie it down firmly between the two rims on the upper end of the clyster; and then give the enema.

[] [10]
This is the figure of the circle of skin with the holes.

[] [11]
Now the way to give an enema with this instrument is for the parchment or bladder to be filled with the medicament, which should be warmed so as to be tolerable for the patient; but beware lest it be too hot or too cold.

[] [12]
Then let the patient lie back and raise his legs; and put under them a leather mat or a blanket.

 CHAPTER EIGHTY-FOUR.

[18] []
And if the wounds are deep and hairy and full of mud, then pierce it in the lowest place; and if the artery is cut, and bleeding occurs, then uncover it, and wash it, and cauterize it if necessary; and if the cartilage of the throat is cut, or the gullet, and the passage is preserved, through which the food goes, then sew the gullet over the cartilage of the throat, and do not touch the throat but restore it according to its natural shape; and then bind it properly, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed; and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then clean it; and if there are pieces of bone, then pull them all out if you can, and those that you cannot get, leave until the wound rots, and is separated and the opening cleared; and if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned.

[] [33]
But if there be depth to the wound and a sinus appears at the bottom of it, in which pus has collected, then make an opening at the site of greatest depth.

[] [34]
Now if an artery has been cut in the wound and you are in time to find it still bleeding, divide it or ligature it; or cauterize it if you are compelled to.

[] [35]
If it be such a wound that some of the cartilages of the trachea are laid open, or the whole trachea, the jugular veins being safe and sound, then join the skin edges together with a suture over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, but straighten it and restore to its natural form; then tie firmly and leave for some days; then treat with salves having some styptic and astringent quality, until healed.

[] [36]
If the wound has affected bone, examine it, and if there be fragments of bone in it get them all out, or all you can.

[] [37]
Those you cannot get hold of, leave until the wound suppurates and heals, and it will be easy to extract them.

[] [5]
Small openings may also be difficult in another way, for they are bound to be harder to reduce, and if you do not hurry to return the gut to its place at once it will swell up and enlarge, thus rendering reduction difficult.

[] [6]
So the best tear is the medium-sized, for in this case the reduction of the intestine will not be as difficult as in the two other cases.

[] [7]
 Then you should know that suturing the abdomen may be carried out in four ways.

[] [8]
Two of them are general; suitable both for suture of the abdomen and for other wounds of the body.

[] [9]
The other two sutures are special; they may be used for other wounds, but are more suitable for abdominal wounds.

[] [10]
I shall describe each one to you separately, with comments and explanation.

[] [18]
The curved side should be sharpened, but not the other; the slender extremity should not be as slender as a scalpel, but rather blunt; it is an instrument like a small polo-stick, as you see.

[7] []
In small wounds, put what is prepared for you, then have between your hands a skillful assistant who holds the whole rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together; and this is the common way of stitching, and it is that you take one needle or more, according to the size of the width of the wound, then leave from the top of the wound a finger's width of space, and insert a needle there with a good strong thread; and pierce both edges of the skin with both edges of the siphac, which is under the skin inside, until you make it pierce on that side, and bring the two edges of the siphac all four together; then tighten it with a double thread around the needle on both sides, then bring the two edges of the wound together evenly, and then leave a finger's width of space, and insert another needle there; then tie it with thread as you did the first needle, and do not stop doing this according to how many needles you need, until the whole wound is closed; and the needles should be medium-sized, between fine and thick, because fine needles cut all the flesh, and those that are too thick cannot enter well: therefore they must be medium; and do not put the needles too far outside the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before it is stitched; and then cut the heads of the needles, so that they do not hurt the patient while sleeping, and put tents or cloths at the heads of the needles to hold them better, and leave them until the wound is healed; and this way of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles suffice. The second stitching is common, and it is that you bring the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the syfac together with a needle with a strong medium thread; and when you have pierced these edges all four together, bring the needle back to the part where you began, in the manner in which one sews cloth; and put a space between each stitch the width of a little finger; men know this stitching, and I stitched a wound that a man had in his belly, who was wounded with a knife, and the wound was more than a palm long, and the intestines protruded a good two palms, and the wound was in the middle of the belly. 

[] [23]
But in small wounds put the patient in a position convenient to yourself.

[] [24]
Then have an assistant under your direction to enclose within his hands the whole of the wound and bring the edges together, and then uncover it bit by bit for the one who is putting in the stitches.

[] [25]
 Now this is the description of one general suture, namely: one or more needles are taken, depending on the size of the wound; then, leaving about the width of the little finger from the end of the opening, pass an unthreaded needle from within through both edges of the skin together with both edges of the peritoneum which lies beneath the skin, piercing from one side to the other; thus you will have brought together both skin edges and both peritoneal edges, making four layers.

[] [26]
Then wind a double thread several times round the needle, and tighten up from both sides so as to bring the two edges of the wound perfectly together.

[] [27]
Then again leave about a finger's breadth and put in another needle and fasten it with thread as you did in the first instance; and go on doing this with as many needles as you need until you have finished mending the whole wound.

[] [28]
The needles should be of medium fineness; for the very fine needles soon cut into the flesh; while thick needles, on the other hand, are difficult to pass through the skin; so they should be medium between fineness and thickness.

[] [29]
You should not introduce the needle too near the edge of the skin lest the tissues be soon cut through and the wound gape before it has joined.

[] [30]
Nor should there be too great an interval between the stitches, lest the wound be prevented from scarring up.

[] [31]
Then cut off the ends of the needles lest they hurt the patient during sleep; and make for him pads of linen scraps to cover the needle ends on both sides; and let them be until you know the wound is healed up.

[] [32]
This method of suture with needles is most suitable in small wounds, for one or two needles or thereabouts will probably be enough for such.

[] [33]
Now the second kind of general suture is to bring together all four edges, the two skin edges and the two peritoneal edges, at one and the same time, with a needle furnished with a twisted thread of medium thickness.

[] [34]
Then when the needle has pierced these four edges bring it back precisely to where you began, so that the thread may lie knitted over the wound to make a stitch in the manner of sewing up the bags in which goods are packed.

[] [35]
The distance between stitches should be a little finger's breadth.

[] [36]
Everybody is familiar with this stitch.

[] [37]
With this stitch I once sewed up a wound that a man got in the belly.

[] [38]
He had been wounded with a knife; and the opening of the wound was more than a span long; and by that time there protruded some two spans' length of his mid-gut.

[] [43]
 I shall now describe one of the two kinds of special suture according to the text of Galen.

[] [44]
You begin at the skin, running the needle from without inwards.

[] [45]
When you pass it through the skin and the muscle that runs the length of the belly, leave the edge of the peritoneum on that side where the needle was introduced; and pierce the other edge of the peritoneum from within outwards through the other edge of the abdominal wall.

[] [46]
When you have done this, pierce the same edge of the abdominal wall from the outside inwards, leaving the edge of the peritoneum which is on that side, and pierce the other side from within outwards.

[] [47]
As you pierce, make the needle pass through the peritoneum to the edge of the abdominal wall that is adjacent to that part until it pierces right through the whole.

[] [52]
 Now the manner of the second type of special stitch which Galen mentioned is this (these are his own words): that you suture it in the same way as many practitioners.

[] [53]
That is, they suture each part to the part that corresponds naturally to it; so they join one peritoneal margin to the other and one skin margin to the other, in the manner I shall describe.

[] [54]
You should put the needle from without inwards, in that edge of the abdominal wall that is nearest to you, and make it pass inward through that alone, leaving out the peritoneal edges; then turn the needle round and run it from without inwards through both peritoneal edges.

[] [55]
Then turn it round again and make it pierce, from within outwards, the other edge of the abdominal wall, on the opposite side.

[] [56]
This type of suture is better than the easy general suture that has been mentioned.

[13] []
The treatment of the wound is like the treatment of other wounds: and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the burn has changed it, then put the intestine back, and sew it; then put on the flesh-generating powder, and if the burn has changed it, then put on some ointment that is available, until the wound festers; and let the threads fall out, and let the siphac and the wound be healed; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed; and if you have no medicines, then put on, as soon as it begins to fester, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.

[14] []
For you do not need other medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple; and if you suspect that the wound may affect the principal members, then you should moisten light wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and put it around the groin, and under the armpits; and if he feels pain or pus in the bowels, and it often happens, then give him enemas of lukewarm dark wine, and especially if the pus reaches the intestine; and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.

[] [61]
But the medical treatment of the wound comes under just the same heading as that of other wounds.

[] [62]
When you find a wound with its blood quite fresh, before the atmosphere has altered it, and you have reduced the intestine and have sewn it up and closed it firmly, apply to it powder to encourage fresh growth.

[] [63]
But if the air has altered it, then apply to it some of the available ointments until it suppurates and the threads come away and the peritoneum and abdominal wall heal; then dress it as you would any other wound, until it is better.

[] [64]
If you have no medicaments to hand, apply cotton wool as soon as suppuration begins, and change it twice daily, as I have taught you, until it heals.

[] [65]
You will need no other treatment in the majority of cases when the wounds are simple.

[] [66]
 But if you fear that the important organs may share the hurt of the wound, then you should dip some soft wool in moderately warm olive-oil or oil of roses and bind it round the various sites between the groin and the axillae.

[] [67]
If pain or gangrene be felt in the bowels—and that frequently happens—then clyster him with tepid astringent black wine, particularly if the gangrene has already set in in the bowel and has become a wound penetrating to the abdominal cavity.

[] [68]
You should know that if the injured bowel be the large intestine it will heal the more easily, while if it be the small its healing is more difficult.

[] [73]
 A note on the wound occurring in the intestine.

[19] []
And when I saw it closed, I feared that the patient would have pain in his belly; and he had no pain there, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking; and some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be tied in this manner: take ants with large heads, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the ant has opened its mouth, put it on the two edges, so that it clamps its mouth on them; and then cut off its head, and this holds it so that it cannot come undone, then put another ant after it in the same way as before, until the wound is completely enclosed; and sew the wound.

[20] []
These heads thus burn the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can also tie the intestine with a fine thread which is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this way: take the end of this intestinal thread that is very lean, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then put the thread in the needle, and sew the intestine with it, and put it back into the rupture; and this manner of stitching with ants is only by way of trust and hope; and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy nor health, except subtlety.

[] [78]
And when I saw that the place had healed over I was afraid for the patient lest some harm should occur in the abdominal cavity; but absolutely no harm arose from it, and he remained perfectly well and healthy, eating and drinking and engaging in coitus and going to the bath and carrying out the duties of his office.

[] [79]
Some men of experience have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, it should be sutured in this manner, namely: ants with large heads are taken; then the edges of the wound are brought together and one of these ants is applied by its open jaws to the two edges of the wound, and when it seizes it and closes its jaws then the head is cut off, and it will stick and will not loosen.

[] [80]
Then another ant is applied near the first; and you proceed after this manner with a number of ants according to the size of the wound.

[] [81]
Then reduce the intestine and sew up the wound; for the heads will remain sticking to the intestine until it is healed up; and no harm will come to the patient.

[] [82]
 The intestine may also be sewn up with the fine suture which is extracted from an animal's gut and sticks to it after being threaded in a needle.

[] [83]
The method is that the end is taken of this suture made of gut, well scraped; and to this end is fixed a fine linen thread, twisted, and then that thread is passed through the needle affixed to the suture of animal's gut, with which the intestine is sewn and then replaced in the abdominal cavity.

[] [84]
These kinds of suture, with the ants and with the gut, are by way of a remote hope.

[] [85]
But if the opening be great and wide, and especially if it be in one of the small intestines, there is no technique to deal with it, nor any cure.

On the treatment of defluxions and fistulae.

[2] []
And a fistula, according to the truth, is a faulty, hard, and white node, where one feels no pain, and is as hollow as a bird's feather; and sometimes clear fluid comes out of it, and sometimes thick; sometimes little, and sometimes a lot; and I have already spoken of it in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and where there is no flesh, is only due to one of nine causes: that is to say, due to the lack of blood or body; or because of its malignancy; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, which prevents flesh from growing; or there is too much fluid; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of poor quality; or the medicine is not good for the cure; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because of the property of the region, the digestion is slow, and the healing is slow, and swells naturally; or there are veins or bones: and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.

[] [3]
The fistula proper is a compact hard white painless induration with a central hollow like a bird's quill; on which account some call it a quill.

[] [4]
At certain times it may be moist, constantly discharging pus; and again at certain times the moisture may cease; and the discharge may be greater or less; and it may be thick or thin.

I said previously in the appropriate section, when I was discussing abscesses, that any ulcer that would not heal nor show growth of tissue was due to one of nine causes.

[] [6]
One is lack, or poorness, of blood in the body; or it may be because the hardness of the tissues, internally and at the edges of the opening, prevents the growth of sound tissue; or it may be because of the abundance of foul and evil matter; or it may be because the ulcer is necrotic in itself and the matter that it discharges is of bad quality; as also it may be because the remedy used in treating it is not suitable; or again it may be because of corruption arising at that locality, of the nature of pestilence; or it may be due to something special and peculiar in the locality—as happens in the city of Saragossa, where diseases tend to linger and tumours are naturally slow to heal; or it may be due to one or more bones in it.

[] [7]
I have indeed already, in their proper place, explained all these causes and their symptoms and their medical treatments.

[5] []
And all fistulas of this kind are difficult to heal, and there is nothing but work and ignorance; and if there is a fistula that does not reach the place I mentioned, and you have confidence in the cure, and you want to examine it, take a probe of brass or iron, if the fistula is straight, then probe it; and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a thin lead probe, because lead bends easily around the crookedness; and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot probe it well, then inject it through one of the openings, for the moisture will flow from one opening to another, and cleanse it; then examine it carefully as best you can, so that you know if there is bone or nerve, and if it is hollow and deep, and ask the patient carefully about the pain he feels when you press with your hand, and where he feels it; and when you truly know where it is, and whether it is far from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery or vein, or in any of the places I have mentioned, cut it as I have told you, and remove the infected matter and the corrupted flesh that are inside; and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep in a straight line, you must cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in tents soaked in a sharp medicine, and push them to the head of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom; and then put in ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed; and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, cut it.

[] [10]
Fistulae of this kind are among the diseases from which recovery is difficult; they are not amenable to treatment and to occupy oneself with them is labour in vain.

[] [11]
But if there are any fistulae which do not reach in depth the places we have mentioned, and you have some hope and expectation of curing them, and you wish to attain to recognizing these, then you take a probe of bronze or iron, if the fistula run in a straight line, and investigate it with that.

[] [12]
But if the fistula be tortuous then investigate it with a thin leaden probe; for lead is soft, so as to flex on entry and follow the curves of the fistula.

[] [13]
But if the fistula have multiple openings so that you cannot explore it with the probe, then make an injection into one of the openings.

[] [14]
The fluid you inject into that one will run to the other openings and flow out from them.

[] [15]
Then make a complete exploration by whatever means you can, to find out whether there be at that place a bone or nerve, and whether the fistula be deep or superficial, and whether the fistula be one with multiple openings.

[] [16]
Inform yourself of all these points, exerting yourself to inquire of the patient whether he feels pain while you are compressing with the hand, and seeking other indications and causes of tumour that may arise.

[] [17]
When you have made quite certain of all these points, then proceed confidently with the treatment, namely: see if the fístula be obvious and accessible, or in a harmless situation far removed from a joint or vein or artery or tendon or any of the other places I have mentioned to you.

[] [18]
Then lay open the fístula by the method I have described and fetch out of it all the granulations and diseased and superfluous tissue and whatever tissue or growth be arising in its opening, and dress until healed.

[] [19]
If the termination of the fistula lies deep and its course be straight, you should cut it open as far in as you can and then clean out of it all diseased tissue; then use swabs soaked in corrosive, and push them to the bottom of the fistula, which is as far as you can reach with the probe.

[] [20]
Do this repeatedly until the caustic has destroyed all the superfluous matter remaining at the bottom of the fistula.

[] [21]
Then dress it with ointments that make the flesh grow sound, until it heals.

[] [22]
But if it does not heal thus, then cauterize it in the prescribed way.

[9] []
There was a young man of about thirty years, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, so much so that the matter went to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no need to open it with fire; but the physicians, in their folly, worked on it so much that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed from it, and it became a fistula, and many openings appeared, all of which discharged fluid and moisture from the body; and many physicians treated it for about two years, and there was no one wise in the art among them, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which he was being treated, and what flowed from the openings in large quantity; and the young man's body became red, and had a yellowish color.

[] [31]
If it is not possible for you to extract the bone immediately, apply over the wound something to induce suppuration, and leave it for some days until suppuration has set in in the tissues and ligaments around the bones.

[] [32]
Keep an eye on the wound lest the incision that you made during your operation close up; if you fear this, apply to it cotton wool soaked in sulphur beaten with olive-oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or in one of the green ointments.

[] [33]
Then, when those ligaments have been softened by putrefaction and the bones crumble, it will be easy to shift them and take them out.

[] [34]
If it be one large bone such as the tibia or the femur or the like, and the diseased part be only the surface, then scrape it thoroughly until all the blackness and corruption is gone, then close the wound.

[] [35]
If the corrupt portion be very extensive and reach to the marrow of the bone, you will not be able to avoid sawing it off and cutting it all away to the point where the corruption ends; then dress until healed.

[] [36]
 Now I shall tell you of a defluxion that once occurred in a man's leg, as an example and a help to you in your treatment.

[] [37]
This man was young, about thirty years of age.

[] [38]
He once got a pain in the leg from something internal, which so worked that eventually matter came into the leg and caused it to swell greatly, there being no external cause.

[] [39]
And time passed by, to the accompaniment of error on the part of the doctors, until the tumour opened and much discharge came away; and the treatment was so mismanaged that fistulae formed in the leg and many sinuses opened up, all of which discharged pus and body humours.

[] [40]
A whole host of doctors had been treating it for a matter of two years, not one of whom had any skill in the surgical art.

[] [41]
Eventually he sought me.

[] [42]
I saw his leg, with matter coming away from the orifices in large quantities; and the man's body was wasted and jaundiced.

[11] []
I hurried then, and cut into one of the openings until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted and perforated, and the corruption went down to the bone inside; I scraped what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except what I removed; and I began to restore the wound with healing medicines for a long time, and it could not heal; and then I started again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing in the bone, and I scraped it, and then removed it, and tried to heal the place; but I could not until I cut around a handbreadth of the bone, and pulled it out with all its marrow, then restored it with medicines; and it was healed and joined quickly, and there was no need to restart the work except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure it, and for the fear of death that I had for him.

[] [45]
So I quickly cut down upon one of these openings until a part of the bone was laid bare, and I found it diseased, by now eaten away, and black and foul and full of holes, down to the marrow.

[] [46]
So I sawed off as much of the diseased bone as I had exposed and could get at.

[] [47]
In fact I thought that there was no more disease in the bone beyond what I had cut and sawn away, and that I had completely eradicated it.

[] [48]
Then I tried for a very long time to heal the wound with medicines encouraging growth of flesh, but it would not heal.

[] [49]
Then I again uncovered the bone, above the first opening, and found the corruption co-extensive with the bone.

[] [50]
So again I sawed away as much of the corruption as I could see; then I tried to heal it, but it would not heal nor unite.

[] [51]
Then I opened it up once more and went on cutting away the bone piecemeal and trying to heal it, and it would not heal until I had cut away about a span of bone with the marrow; then I treated it medicinally and it quickly healed over and was cured.

[] [52]
But it would not have been necessary to repeat the operation and the incision thus, were it not for the patient's weakness and inability to tolerate much at a time, and because of my fears for his life, since an evil faint was constantly seizing him on account of the heavy drain.

[13] []
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it should be scraped in this manner: take a linen cloth, and tighten it at the end of the bone that appears, and order someone to pull it upwards; and put another woolen cloth, thicker than the first cloth, and tie it over the flesh that is above the bone, and stretch the end, so that you pull the corrupted flesh below, and uncover the flesh over the place where you want to scrape, so that the scraping does not injure the flesh; and put a firebrand or a board under the bone to better cut the corrupted flesh; and it is necessary to scrape as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and scrape again another time.

[14] []
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh; then put a firebrand underneath, and then scrape the corruption from one side to the other, and let the scraping be a little along the length of the corruption, as we have said; and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and scrape the bone where it connects on the other side; and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other solution than to cut; and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, that is a very difficult thing, but nevertheless you must examine this corrosion, how it appears to you; and clean it in all the ways you can, but so that the veins or the nerves do not cause you difficulty; and know that the incisors and scrapers for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and their thinness, and their size and their smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare for each type of work its instrument; and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the characteristics of the diseases; so consider the instrument you need according to what is required.

[] [55]
 Now in the case of a prominent bone that has been broken in any part of the body, it should be sawn off in this manner: you take a ligature and tie it to the extremity of the prominent bone and bid someone keep it stretched upward; then you put on another ligature of wool thicker than the first, tying it to the tissue that is beneath the bone, and pull on the end so that the flesh is drawn down and you lay bare of flesh the spot where you intend to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.

[] [56]
You should place a block of wood or a board firmly beneath the bone; which done, there is no hindrance to the saw's cutting through the diseased bone.

[] [57]
The saw-cut should be made a little above the site of the disease in case there should be disease in the cavity of the bone that is not apparent on the surface, which might compel you to carry out the sawing a second time.

[] [58]
If the bone be diseased without any swelling, but it all seems the same from one part to another, and the disease be in the middle or in one segment of it, then expose it on all sides; put the block beneath, and saw it from the first side, where the disease is.

[] [59]
When you have finished this, saw it from the other side.

[] [60]
The saw-cut should be at a little distance from the diseased part, as we have already said.

[] [61]
 If the disease be in one of the phalanges, amputate the diseased phalanx and saw through the bone where it is continuous on the other (healthy) side.

[] [62]
If the disease be in the joint between two members, then there is nothing to be done but scraping.

[] [63]
If the disease be in the carpus or tarsus it is a very difficult matter treating them; you must peel off the disease in whatever way seems possible, and scrape it away and clean up the part in whatever way you can and by whatever technique is convenient for you, so long as there is no vein or nerve in your way.

[] [64]
Now you should know that there are a great number of cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones, varying according to the different sites and arrangements of the bones; their thickness or thinness; their greatness or smallness; their hardness or sponginess; so you should have ready for every sort of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.

[] [65]
You should know too that when you have long experience and knowledge of the branches of this art the operations themselves may well indicate the kind of instrument needed; for the man who is skilled in the art and has seen various kinds of disease may think out for himself which instrument is suitable for each disease.

[] [66]
At the end of this chapter I give you illustrations of a number of instruments as types for you to copy and as a pattern upon which you can base others, God willing:

[] [67]
 Saw.

[] [68]
Another saw.

[] [69]
 A small saw.

[] [70]
 A large saw.

[] [71]
 Scraper; the head of this scraper should resemble the head of a nail, stellate, engraved like a file.

[] [72]
What it is suitable for is to scrape the diseased heads of joints, or big broad bones.

[] [73]
Another scraper, small.

[] [74]
 Broad scraper.

[] [75]
Firm (bow) saw.

[] [76]
The upper bow and the blade are made of iron, the handle of box-wood, turned and firmly fixed.

[] [77]
Scraper with concavity.

[] [78]
Another scraper, fine.

[] [79]
 Scraper.

[] [80]
Another scraper, with bent extremity.

[] [81]
Small scraper resembling a probe.

[] [82]
Osteotome.

[] [83]
 Another osteotome, small.

[] [84]
Another scraper.

[] [85]
Its extremity is like a probe, and it is handy in many places for scraping bone.

[] [86]
A scraper suitable for perforated bone.

[] [87]
Its extremity is triangular, with sharp edges.

[] [88]
It is made of Indian iron, as should be all the scrapers and cutting instruments we have mentioned.

of fire

[1] []
The head rots either because of an internal cause, or because of an external one; and when you have treated this corrosion with the cure of medicines, and they are of no use, then it is necessary to cut off that limb up to the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes death by this, or by the greater harm, the loss of the limb; and the sign is that the limb becomes black, so that it looks like it is burned by fire, and rots after the blackness, then this corrosion goes from limb to limb, and takes over the whole body; so hurry to cut, and if it is from the bite of some venomous beast, such as a sea scorpion and viper and the like, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to come up to the hand.

[2] []
And if it comes up to the hand, cut it off at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm; and if it comes to the arm, cut it off at the elbow; and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no external treatment is of any use except for the strength of its virtue; and do the same when the corrosion comes in the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the next joint; and if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it goes up the leg, cut at the knee joint; and if it comes above the knee, there is no other solution than to leave the patient to die; and the way to cut or scrape the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant stretches one of the cloths downwards, and another assistant stretches the other cloth upwards, and you separate the flesh that is between the two cloths to a width of a spatula, so that the bone is uncovered; then cut or scrape it, and put a linen cloth on each side, so that the scraping does not touch the healthy place, and cause the patient further injury and hot abscess.

[3] []
And if bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the place quickly, or put on some astringent powders; then return to your treatment until it is completed, then tie the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed; and I will tell you what happened to a man in his foot: a blackness appeared on it that looked like a burn, and this corrosion first came to his toe, until it took over the whole foot; and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off his foot, and was healed; and a long time afterwards the corrosion returned to his finger, and he came to me, and I put on repercussive things after cleansing the body, and the corrosion could not be stopped; and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hoped to repel the matter; and I also feared that if I cut off his hand, he would die, because the man's strength was weak; and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed; and I have only told this so that others may do the same, if they need to.

 CHAPTER EIGHTY-SEVEN.

[] [1]
On the amputation of limbs and the sawing-off of bones.

[] [2]
 Sometimes the extremities become gangrenous, either from an external or an internal cause.

[] [3]
Now when you have treated this disease by medical means, ineffectively, and you see that the disease is spreading over the limb and nothing will stop it, you must cut off that limb as far as the disease has spread, so that the patient may escape death or great affliction, greater than the loss of the limb.

[] [4]
 Now the sign of the victim of this state is that the limb goes black, so that you might think it were burnt with fire, or, after the blackening, it putrefies, and the putrefaction spreads to parts adjacent to that limb and begins to attack the whole body; cut it away as soon as you can.

[] [5]
So must you do if the disease is caused by the bite of some dangerous reptile such as the marine scorpion, viper, or venomous spider, and so on.

[] [6]
If the disease or bite be at the tip of the finger, cut off the finger, giving the disease no opportunity to spread to the rest of the hand.

[] [7]
Similarly, if it attacks the hand, cut if off at the wrist, giving the disease no opportunity to spread and attack the two bones of the forearm.

[] [8]
Similarly, if it attacks the forearm, cut it off at the elbow through the joint itself.

[] [9]
If the disease passes onward and you perceive that it has reached the region of the shoulder, by no means cut the shoulder, for that will be the death of the patient; use any treatment but that, as best you may.

[] [10]
In the same manner act in regard to the foot when the disease attacks a toe; namely, amputate the toe through one of the interphalangeal joints.

[] [11]
If the disease attacks the tarsus then amputate the whole foot; and if it ascends toward the knee, amputate the leg at the knee-joint.

[] [12]
If it be that the disease has passed on above the knee, there is nothing of any avail in this case but to leave it, and for the patient to resign himself to death.

[] [13]
Now the way to amputate or saw off a limb is to bind a ligature round below the site and another above; an assistant draws the one downward and another assistant draws the upper ligature upward; while you dissect away the tissues between the two ligatures with a broad scalpel until it is laid bare of flesh; then it should be cut or sawn.

[] [14]
You must place linen dressings on every side lest the saw touch a part that is sound and thus cause the patient additional pain and inflammation.

[] [15]
If a haemorrhage occurs while you are operating, cauterize the place as quickly as possible, or apply to it one or other of the styptic powders; then continue until finished.

[] [16]
Then bind up the mutilated limb with a suitable bandage and dress until healed.

[] [17]
Now I shall relate to you an example; what I am going to tell you is exactly what happened to a certain man's foot.

[] [18]
He had a blackening of the foot, with a burning like that of fire.

[] [19]
The disease, to begin with, was in one toe, but it went on to involve the whole foot.

[] [20]
When the man saw the disease spreading in the limb and felt the violent pain and burning, he hastened of his own accord to amputate it at the joint, and he got better.

[] [21]
After a long time had passed the very same kind of disease arose in the forefinger of his hand.

[] [22]
He came to me, and I attempted to suppress the superfluity with remedies that I applied to the hand, after purging his body; but the superfluity was not to be suppressed and began to spread to the second finger, and eventually the whole hand was involved in the disease.

[] [23]
He urged me to cut off his hand, but I did not wish to do this, hoping I should be able to overcome the superfluity, and also fearing he would die at the amputation of his hand, for the man's strength was on the decline.

[] [24]
 When he despaired of me he went back to his own country, and I then heard that he had gone and cut off his whole hand, and got well.

[] [25]
I narrate this story as help against this kind of malady when it occurs; and as guidance for you to take and act upon.

Sometimes an abscess arises in a fleshy place, and remains so long that it creates a large collection of pus; and then it breaks and bursts, and the pus comes out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin that is on top is as thin as a thin cloth, and it does not run down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such a disease is called "sain," and is not called "fistula"; but if it is so elongated that it reaches the bone deeply, it is called "fistula"; and the treatment is that you cut off this skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it will not heal because of its corruption.

[1] []
And if you are confident that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with a clyster thus: see if the sinus is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put them to cook in a vessel on the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey; and then take some of this according to your need, and dissolve it in water and honey, and clysterize the sinus, and close the opening; and leave the medicine inside for two hours, then remove it by squeezing; do this many times, until the sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed; and sometimes it is clysterized with water of ashes, when this medicine is not available, and you should take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over them, then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the sinus is well cleansed; and if the patient cannot bear it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, clysterize it with water and honey with a little ground litharge; or clysterize it with honey and wine mixed, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine makes the sinus heal; and when you have done this, and you are confident that the sinus is well cleansed, clysterize it with that which makes flesh grow in it, and that is that you take diachylon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and wine; or you clysterize it with some medicines and ointments, whose properties I have described in the treatise on ointments; and if the opening of the sinus is small, and the tube of the clyster cannot enter it, widen it a little with an iron, and put in a tent of the Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened; and if the wound is too large, sew it up and leave only one place where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that emits pus is at the top, make the opening in the lowest place there is.

[2] []
For when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to generate; and if you cannot cut the sinus from below as you would like, prepare it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest place there is, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to generate and if you cannot cut the sinus from below as you would like, prepare it in such a way: that the pus runs easily downwards, and leaves none of the pus behind; and take consolidative medicines to put on the sinus, and spread over it a linen cloth that covers the whole sinus; then forcibly cut the opening of the sinus a little wider than before, then spread a soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it on the opening of the sinus to draw out the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days, once; and the one that is over the opening of the sinus, remove often to remove the pus, and know what runs from the pus, whether it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested; and take note if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been applied in this way and you see that nature is acting on the opening of the sinus, know that the sinus will soon heal, and health is approaching; and then untie it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you untie the wound, apply another cloth, and renew the ointment.

 CHAPTER EIGHTY-EIGHT.

[] [1]
On the treatment of sinuses and the way to irrigate them.

[] [2]
 When an abscess occurs in any of the fleshy parts and becomes chronic and eventually collects pus, and then it breaks open or is perforated, and all the contained matter comes out and the site is left hollow, like a vessel, and the overlying skin thinned like a rag, but the suppuration has not gone so far as to involve bone or tendon or ligament—and hence it merits the name of 'sinus' and is not called a fistula.

[] [3]
But if it goes on until the disease involves any of these parts it is then called a fistula or defluxion.

[] [4]
 The treatment of it will be to cut away all that skin with a circular incision; specially if it be thinned and has become like a rag, and you are sure that it will not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.

[] [5]
But if you are in hope of its adhering, and the corruption has not reached that point, and there is in the skin some thickness of flesh, then treat it by irrigation.

[] [6]
The procedure is that you examine the sinus, and if it be large and the purulent discharge from it smell bad, then irrigate it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, honey and verdigris, equal parts of each, mixed in a vessel and heated on the fire until the compound thickens and assumes the consistency of honey.

[] [7]
Then take as much as you need and dilute it with water and honey, and with this irrigate the sinus and bind up the opening, leaving the compound inside for two hours.

[] [8]
Then get it out by pressure.

[] [11]
For that, you take ashes of vine or of oak, and put water upon them; then clarify the liquor and with it irrigate the sinus until you are sure it is thoroughly clean.

[] [12]
But if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the water of ashes, then irrigate him with water and honey with which a little pounded verdigris has been mixed; or irrigate with honey and wine mingled; the value of the honey lies in its cleansing and washing, while the wine closes up the sinus, specially if it be a wine which has some dryness and astringency.

[] [13]
When you have done this several times and you are sure that the sinus is clean of diseased matter, then irrigate it with those compounds that will encourage granulation in it.

[] [14]
For example, you may take a little Palm ointment and dissolve it in oil of roses and some astringent wine; or irrigate it with some of the other ointments and medicines whose prescriptions we have recorded in the treatise on ointments.

[] [15]
If the opening of the sinus be too narrow for the nozzle of the syringe, open it up slightly with the knife, or put in it a pad steeped in Egyptian ointment or vermilion ointment, until it is dilated.

[] [16]
On the other hand, if the opening be wide, bring the edges together with a suture, and leave of it sufficient width that the syringe may be only just introduced.

[] [17]
In the same way, if the opening from which the discharge flows be raised up, then incise it at its lowest part so that the discharge may flow downward out of it; for when the discharge collects at the bottom of the sinus it prevents the formation of flesh in it.

[] [18]
If you cannot open it up as you wish at the lower point, then try to set the part in whatever position you conveniently can to facilitate the discharge of pus, and try to ensure that no pus is held up in it.

[] [19]
 As for the consolidating medicaments that are applied externally to the sinus, and the manner of their application: you take one of the ointments suited to your purpose, and spread it on a piece of lint of sufficient size to cover the whole sinus; then with scissors cut a hole in the lint over the mouth of the sinus and a little wider than the sinus opening; then spread on another piece of lint a quantity of softening ointment proportionate to the opening and put the one on the other so that it stands away from the opening of the sinus, in order to ease the discharge of pus from it; and do not remove the larger dressing until after many days.

[] [20]
But the dressing over the sinus opening you may constantly remove, so that the pus collected behind it may come out and so that you may know whether there be much or little ichor, and whether digested or not.

[] [21]
And at the same time investigate the site of the sinus itself to see whether the patient feels any pain in it or no pain, and whether there be any swelling in it or not.

[] [22]
Then when your treatment has reached such a point that you see that there is only a little superficial matter coming out round the mouth of the sinus, you may know that the sinus has closed up or is near to closing up.

[] [23]
Then you may unbandage it the next day or the third day, and when the wound is unbandaged make a change of dressing and ointment.

[5] []
For there are men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and those who do the opposite; and if undigested pus comes from the sinus after many days, know that the sinus will not heal; and if the sinus is slow to heal, and is deep, add medicines that are moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as diachylon ointment, for it contains a large part of vitriol, and it is the last medicine; take diachylon ointment, and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with old wine equal in substance; then thicken it and use it; and the same is better done with cooked fat, when diachylon ointment is not available, or you take myrrh and aloe and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey when it is on the fire; and then glue a cloth to it, and spread it on the sinus, and sometimes administer long birthwort, and roots of celestial lily, which is like vetch flour and centaury; and use simple or compound: grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey that I have mentioned, and use it; and if the treatment is prolonged, and it is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard parts, or on the ligaments; then treat it with the treatment for fistula, as we have said before. 

[] [25]
For there are some men whose wounds are slow in healing, and some are the opposite.

[] [26]
 If, after many days, undigested pus is discharged you may know that the sinus has not closed.

[] [27]
If the closing of the sinus be delayed and it be a long affair, make the medicines dryer; let them be medicines that have some humidity in their substance but dryness in their potency, such as Palm ointment with the addition of excess of rock-alum.

[] [28]
A most efficacious treatment is to take Palm ointment and dissolve it in oil of roses and sprinkle over it old wine of even consistency.

[] [29]
Then knead together, and use that.

[] [30]
The same sort of thing may be done with honey if you have no

[] [31]
 Palm ointment at hand; if you heat the honey to a thick consistency and use that; or take myrrh and aloes and incense of juniper and beat them all up together and sprinkle on the honey while it is heating on the fire, spread on lint and bind over the sinus; or spread on it honey heated to a thickness, and over that sprinkle powdered aromatic roots, and over these place a dressing that you bandage on.

[] [32]
Sometimes also in a case of this sort long birthwort and the root of the blue iris and vetch flour and centaury are usable, either separately or mixed, beaten up together, sifted and scattered into honey as I described; use them thus.

[] [33]
But if the sinus be chronic, and it does not heal with this treatment, then you may know that there is corruption at the bottom of it, which has affected the bones or motor nerves or ligaments; the treatment then is that of fistula as already given.

And if the corrosion is in the bone, cut it and remove it, because as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal; and if you see the finger becoming corrupted, cut it at one of the joints as stated previously, then treat it until it is healed; and if it is struck and bruised, and there is great pain, then you must first reduce the swelling; then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across the top, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, because the patient would feel too much pain; and if this happens, apply something soothing.

The pain of the whitlow of the hand.

But if it should be that the disease has already begun to involve bone, that bone should be excised and removed; for it will never heal while there remains any diseased bone.

And if you see the corrosion and corruption spreading in the finger, amputate it at one of the joints, as has been previously mentioned; then dress it until it is healed.

[] [9]
 If a laceration or bruising happen to the nail, with violent pain, you should first bleed the patient and then cut away the nail with a sharp scalpel, a swerving cut from top to bottom.

[] [10]
But be careful not to cut into the nail-bed, for you will give the patient violent pain and it will cause a growth of superfluous flesh at the place.

 CHAPTER NINETY.

[] [1]
On cutting for varices.

[4] []
The cutting is done in this way: first bathe the leg with very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then constrict the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the area below the knee; then cut the vein in one place, or in two or in three, with a wide cut, then lift and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear; and then tie it off, and instruct him to abstain from foods generating black bile; and repeat the evacuation and healing when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.

[5] []
The removal of it is done in this manner: shave the patient's leg, if there is a lot of hair, then put it in the bath, and bathe the leg with hot water until it becomes red, and the veins swell; and if you do not have a bath, warm it by the fire, and then cut it next to the vein along the top of the knee, or in the area below at the ankle; then open the skin with the hook, and peel the vein from each side, until it appears when it is felt; and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it looks like a white cord; then push the thread under it, until it is lifted from the skin, and then hang it on the hook gently, then cut it in another place three fingers above; then peel the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the thread, as you did, and hang it on another hook, as you did the first time; then make another cut, or several if you need to, then lift it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it up to the second cut; then pull it from cut to cut, until it all comes out, then cut it; and if you cannot pull and lift it, put in a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it and pull it, and put a thread under it, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and be careful not to cut it, because if it is cut, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and it harms the patient; and when you have pulled it all out, put on the wound wool soaked in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.

[] [7]
 The incision is done thus: the leg is first well fomented with hot water to liquefy the thick foul blood; then bind up the patient's leg well from the upper part of his thigh to below the knee; then make an ample incision into the vein in one, two, or three places.

[] [8]
Then with your hand press the black blood upward from the lower part and downward from the upper part of the leg and draw off as much blood as you see suffices or as the patient's strength can bear.

[] [9]
Then bind up, and bid him abstain from foods that give rise to black bile.

[] [10]
The evacuation and venesection should be repeated whenever the veins fill up again to the patient's hurt.

[] [11]
 Extraction is carried out in this way: the patient's leg is shaved if it is very hairy; then bring him to the bath and foment the leg in hot water until it becomes red and the veins are filled.

[] [12]
Or if there be no bath available let him take violent exercise until the limb gets hot.

[] [13]
Then make a longitudinal incision in the skin over the vein, either at the upper end of it near the knee or at the lower end near the ankle.

[] [14]
Then with hooks open up the skin and dissect away round the vein on each side until it is laid open to view.

[] [15]
When it is visible you will see it red almost to the point of blackness; and when it is freed from the skin you will see it look like a cord.

[] [16]
Then pass beneath it a probe to lift it up, and when it is clear of the skin hold it with a blunt smooth hook.

[] [17]
Then make another incision near by, three fingers distant; then dissect away the overlying skin until it comes to view; then raise it with a probe as before and lift it with a second hook as you did at first.

[] [18]
Then make yet another incision or several if need be; then draw out the vessel at the lowest incision near the ankle and cut it through.

[] [19]
Then pull it and draw it out until it emerges from the second incision.

[] [20]
Then draw it towards the incision above that and so on until you draw it out of the third incision (or) the uppermost, until it is all extracted; then cut it off.

[] [21]
But if it does not respond to your attempts to draw and extract it, pass in a needle with a strong double thread and ligate it and draw it up; and introduce a probe beneath it, and twist it all round until it comes out; but be careful lest it break; for if it break the total extraction of it will be very difficult for you and harm will thereby come to the patient.

[] [22]
When you have got it all out, apply to the incisions wool soaked in wine and oil of roses, or olive-oil, and dress it till it be healed.

 CHAPTER NINETY-ONE.

[] [1]
On the extraction of the Medina vein.

[3] []
When the head appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead from one and a half to two ounces, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg, and every time a bit comes out during the cauterization, wrap it around the lead, and tie it; and if it is too long, cut off a part of it, and wrap up the rest, and do not cut it at its root, until it is all out; because if you cut it, it will go back into the flesh, and cause an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a serious illness; therefore it must be drawn out little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body; and this vein is sometimes five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it came out ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe in the hole, and pierce it to the bottom, so that everything comes out; and the matter inside should be emptied, and apply medicines generating putrefaction to the place for a few days, then treat it like abscesses.

[] [6]
When its extremity has appeared it should be wound and tied round a little piece of lead, from one to two drachms in weight, which you leave hanging from the leg.

[] [7]
Then as fast as any of it issues from the leg, wrap it in the lead, and if there be plenty of it cut off part and tie the rest of it; do not cut it right down until it has all come out; for if you cut it right down it will contract and draw back into the flesh and produce at the place an abscess and suppuration and a bad ulcer.

[] [8]
Therefore it should be treated gently, and drawn out slowly until the very extremity of it emerges and not the least bit of it remains in the body.

[] [9]
In some cases the vein comes out five or ten spans in length; indeed I have heard of one twenty spans long that came out from a certain man.

[] [10]
If it breaks during your treatment of it, then pass a probe into the hole and open it up with a long incision longitudinally, until all the contained matter is evacuated; and try to make the place suppurate with medicines for a few days, then treat as an abscess.

 CHAPTER NINETY-TWO.

[] [1]
On incision for the worm arising beneath the skin, called 'the cattle disease'.

[2] []
When you want to treat it and draw it out, it can only be done when it moves: so you must tie the place above and below with a strong, tight ligature, then cut over it and draw it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you cannot find it, cauterize it with fire above, until it dies; and the greatest harm it does is that it damages the eye, as we have said; and if you see it coming in the head near the eye, squeeze the eyebrow tightly below it, then cut over it, and draw it out; and the patient must use cleansing of the body with laxative medicines for the bad putrid humors, and beware of foods generating putrefaction.

[] [6]
If you wish to treat this and extract it, it must be done while it is creeping about and can be felt.

[] [7]
You must tie a tight tourniquet above and below it, then cut down upon it and extract it.

[] [8]
But if it burrows into the tissues and you cannot locate it, then apply the actual cautery to the place until you have burnt the worm.

[] [9]
The greatest damage to be feared from it is damage to the eye, as we have said.

[] [10]
So if you see that it has entered the head and is near the eye, then bind a strong bandage over the forehead beneath it, then cut down upon it and draw it out.

[] [11]
It is important also for the patient to take care to cleanse his body with laxative medicines from all corrupt and evil humours.

[] [12]
He should also avoid all foods giving rise to putrefaction.

 CHAPTER NINETY-FOUR.

[] [1]
On the extraction of arrows.

[] [23]
I also saw a man who had been struck in the back by an arrow and the wound had closed over it; and when the space of seven years had elapsed the arrow came out at the root of the hip.

[] [31]
But nothing happened at that place to indicate that the arrow had come through to there; so I persevered with poulticing it for many days; yet nothing fresh manifested itself and the wound healed up meanwhile, and the patient despaired for a time of its extraction.

[24] []
I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days, until it opened, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow, which was lodged in place; then I added more of that sharp medicine into the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrow appeared visibly to me; and the period of about four months passed, and then the wound widened so that I inserted the forceps, and moved it from side to side, but it could not come out; then I did not cease to refine and devise various instruments, until one day I grasped it with well-made forceps, such as its form will appear at the end of this chapter, until I pulled it out, and healed the wound.

[] [33]
I explored it, and felt the slim end of the arrow which is fastened to the shaft; then I enlarged the opening of the wound by the use of the caustic until the tip of the arrow was plainly visible to me.

[] [34]
About four months passed.

[] [35]
Then when the wound was enlarged and I was able to introduce forceps into it I pulled on it and moved it, but it would not come out.

[] [36]
And I went on skilfully and gently trying for it with various instruments until one day I caught hold of it with a pair of strong forceps (their shape will be described at the end of the chapter) and drew it out; then dressed the wound.

[] [42]
If it does not respond to traction immediately it strikes, you must leave it for a few days until the surrounding tissues have suppurated, when the pulling and extraction of it will be made easy.

of the common veins of the body

[1] []
Of the veins from which one bleeds, there are thirty-one, of which sixteen are in the head, namely: two pulsating ones behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the tip of the nose; and the two jugular veins which are in the neck; and the two veins which are in the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins called "augeherich"; and two veins which are under the tongue. 

[2] []
The veins that are commonly bled from are five in each arm: one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the lay people call it the "head vein"; and the middle one is called "faste", and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it the "heart vein"; and the basilic vein is on the right side, and the lay people call it the "belly vein", and it is above the elbow, and it is the one that is bled, which appears clearly above the pulse.

[] [0]
 CHAPTER NINETY-FIVE.

[] [1]
On venesection.

[] [2]
 The blood-vessels in the body which it is customary to open are thirty(two) in number.

[] [3]
There are sixteen of them in the head, and they are: two pulsating vessels behind the ears that are called the two occipitals; the two external arteries in the temples; and the two veins in the two internal angles of the eyes, called the vessels of sight; and the vein running up the middle of the forehead; and the vein situated at the tip of the nose; and the two jugular veins in the neck; and the two veins in the upper lip and the two in the lower lip; these being the veins known as 'the four vessels'; and two veins beneath the tongue.

[] [4]
 As for the veins that are bled in the arm and hand, they are five.

[] [5]
One is the cephalic, which is on the outer side; popularly they call it the 'headvein'; then there is the 'blue-black', that is, the median vein, which is made up of a branch from the basilic and a branch from the cephalic; popularly they call that the 'body-vein'; then the basilic vein; this is the one situated on the inner side and is termed also the axillary vein, but popularly it is called the 'belly-vein'; and then the cord of the arm; this is situated over the radius and is the one that is contiguous to it; this is the one that is clearly visible on the thumb.

[4] []
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with chronic catarrhs, and with migraines; and the method of bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the patient's head, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then have the patient squeeze his neck with a screw, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging from the head: then search for them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, make a mark with ink; then take the lancet, and push it under the vein down to the bone, then raise your hand with the vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well two finger-widths across, and let out as much blood as you see fit; then squeeze and tie it until it is healed; and I have already spoken of incision and cautery in the first book.

[5] []
Bleeding from the two arteries which are in the two temples, is good for chronic and sudden migraines, and habitual ophthalmia, and for acute tearing of the eyes; and the method of bleeding is as I say: the patient should squeeze his neck, so that the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then mark with ink; then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and push the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done with the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need; then untie the patient, and put your finger on the vein for an hour, then put on cotton; and then tie it tightly, and leave it until it is healed; and we have already spoken of them and their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.

[] [10]
Bleeding from both of these will give relief in cases of chronic catarrh, migraine and chronic foul pustules, and scabs of the head.

[] [11]
The method of venesecting these two is as I shall now describe: the patient's head should be shaved and the hinder part, in the region of the two veins, should be strongly chafed with a rough cloth; then the patient should bind his neck with his turban until the two veins are visible; their position is behind the ears in the two flattened places of the head; feel for them with your finger and when you feel their pulsation beneath your finger then mark the place with ink.

[] [12]
Then take a knife-scalpel, known as a lancet, and insert it beneath the vessel into the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone; then lifting with your hand both vessel and skin make an incision dividing both skin and vein; the length of the incision should be about two fingers side by side; then draw off the quantity of blood you wish.

[] [13]
Then bind them up with dressings and leave it until healed.

[] [14]
The incision and cauterization of these two vessels has been discussed earlier in the book.

[] [15]
The section of the two arteries in the temples gives relief for chronic migraine and severe headache and constant ophthalmia and the flow of acrid superfluities into the eyes.

[] [16]
Now the manner of incising them is as I shall describe: the patient should bind his neck with a sash until the vessels stand out clearly to the eye and their pulsation is manifest under your finger; then mark with ink.

[] [17]
Then with your forefinger raise the skin over the vessel and introduce a lancet beneath and lift up the vein and divide it as you did the other two; and draw off as much blood as you need.

[] [18]
Then loosen the band round the patient's neck and put your finger on the vein for a while; then apply cotton wool and a pad, bandage securely, and leave until it heals.

[] [19]
They and their incision and extraction have been mentioned earlier in the book.

[] [23]
Sometimes it is opened with a broad scalpel; the scalpel, however, should not have a sharp point like other scalpels but should be a little broader at the tip, and the vein is cut obliquely, because the bone is close and the scalpel, if it is too fine, may be broken on it.

[] [24]
 Venesection of the two lachrymal veins gives relief in diseases of the eyes such as granular conjunctiva and inflammation and pannus, and in diseases of the face.

[] [25]
Now this is the method of incising: the patient binds a sash round his throat, then you cut open both veins, standing in front of him.

[11] []
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for fever, and sudden madness, and diseases of the face, such as migraine and redness that comes in the face, especially when it is chronic; and the method of bleeding is that the patient squeezes his neck, then holds his nose with your left hand, and take a thin long lancet, and insert it in the middle of the lip in the space between the two nostrils, because the vein doesn't show well down there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow; and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then tie it for a night, for it is very quickly restored; and this is the shape of the lancet:

[12] []
Bleeding from the two jugular veins helps with shortness of breath, and the beginning of measles, and many illnesses, and impetigo, and herpes, and corroding ulcers; and the method of bleeding is that the patient squeezes his neck beneath each one, as we have said; and let the practitioner stand over the patient's head, and the patient sit on a seat, then bleed the vein lengthwise a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is needed; then do the same in the other vein, then untie the band, and squeeze both veins moderately, so that the patient does not strangle; and leave it until morning, so that the wound is healed.

[13] []
of the bleeding of the lips

[] [32]
Now the way to venesect them is for the patient to bind his neck below them both with a band; let the operator stand behind the patient and let the patient be seated upon a chair.

[] [33]
Then incise the vein longitudinally with a rather wide opening; then let a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you think necessary; then do the same with the other vein.

[] [34]
Then loosen the band and tie the veins with a moderate pressure lest the patient be suffocated; leave him until the next day and the wound will be healed.

[] [35]
 The four veins of the lips: venesection of them is effective, second to section of the cephalic vein, for pustules on the mouth and rotting of the gums and malignant ulcers and fissures of the lips and for malignant ulcer in the nose and round about.

[] [36]
The way to venesect is to seat the patient in front of you and bind a sash round his neck, then roll back his lips and look for the two veins, one of which you will see to the left and the other to the right; their dark colour will show them up against the lip and also the fact that round them are fine dark veins; so cut down upon both, dividing them.

[] [37]
But if you are in doubt about the matter and are not sure what they are, set about incising the largest and most obvious.

[] [49]
The lancet.

[] [50]
This is the lancet for making a slit.

[] [51]
There are broad and narrow varieties of it according to the breadth or narrowness of the vein.

[] [79]
 When anyone has decided to be bled, for whatever reason, first of all his bowels must be purged with a gentle enema if they contain much excrement, lest at the venesection putrid superfluities be drawn from the bowels into the veins, that might harm the chief parts of the body.

[] [80]
No one suffering from indigestion or surfeit or drunkenness should be venesected until recovered from these; nor a dropsical patient.

[] [81]
Beware also of venesection after stomach-trouble or vomiting or diarrhoea or much intercourse or fatigue or exercise or sleeplessness or fasting and anything else that diminishes the strength both bodily and spiritual.

[] [82]
Then, beforehand, see to the refining of the humours, if the blood be thick, by means of food and drink and medicines, if that is practicable for him.

[] [83]
Then, if there is no contra-indication, let him enter the bath; or let him take a little exercise to make the blood thin.

[] [84]
Then perform the venesection in the early part of the day, as we have said.

[] [85]
Let him endeavour on that day to have his mind free from all such evil spiritual affections as anxiety, anger, or fear; and from all bodily affections such as excessive fatigue and weariness and intercourse and the like.

[] [86]
There should also be in the place where he is sitting such things as are customary for men to enjoy, such as various perfumes, aromatics, and music, and the like, as each one may.

[] [87]
Then the venesector should sit on a cushion raised above the cushion of him whose vein is to be opened.

[] [88]
Then let him stretch out his arm, and let the venesector chafe it two or three times with his hand; then he should bind a bandage round it by means of thongs twisted two or three times.

[] [89]
The ligature should be moderately tight, for any other sort of ligature, be it too tight or too loose, will hinder the flow of blood.

[53] []
For there is much blood inside the body which is already heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a large quantity, and enlarge the opening until he falls in a faint; then you must observe all the conditions of bleeding, and put your hand on his pulse while he bleeds, so that death does not come instead of fainting, and this happens many times, when the bloodletter is negligent; and it is not necessary when you want to untie the arm, and let blood flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly on it; nor if it is bent, that he extends the arm hastily, for that would be bad; but leave it until he bleeds a second time; or prick it with the point of the lancet, so that the blood that is congealed at the opening of the vein comes out, and put on a little salt dissolved in water, and press lightly on it.

[] [121]
 He who has abundant blood that has become hot and sharp and has produced fever should be bled at one time, and a large amount should be taken with a wide opening, until he faints (all the rules of venesection having been observed by you); but you should keep your finger on the pulse while the blood flows lest death take the place of fainting, for that often happens when the venesector is ignorant and there is carelessness.

[] [122]
If you wish to loosen the arm and let blood a second time and you find that the opening of the vein is now closed up and the outflow of blood is difficult, you should not press hard upon it nor twist the arm violently, for that is very harmful.

[] [123]
Either you must leave him a while and then bleed him again; or the clot of blood can be removed from the opening of the vein by using the blade of the scalpel, or by applying some salt dissolved in water; or apply some of the great theriac or shakhzanaya; and put light pressure upon it until the blood comes out.

[] [127]
The way to venesect it is for the patient to dip his hand in hot water until the forearm is red from the warmth and the vessel stands out distinctly.

[] [128]
Then bandage a little above it with a moderate pressure, and then cut the vein a little obliquely, neither transversely nor longitudinally.

[] [129]
The incision should be broad, and you should make the cut a little above the wrist.

[] [130]
If the blood does not flow easily, have the hand again put into the vessel of hot water and let the blood flow into the water until you have extracted what is needed.

[] [131]
If it be in the summer time you may be able to dispense with putting the hand back into the hot water; it is mainly in winter that you let the blood flow into hot water.

[] [132]
Venesection of this vessel is safer than all others for beneath it there is neither artery nor nerve.

of cupping bloodletting

[] [0]
 CHAPTER NINETY-SIX.

[] [1]
On cupping and the manner of employing it.

[2] []
And this cupping which is done without lancing is of two kinds: either it is with fire, or without fire; and cupping which is done by lancing and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, one of which is at the very top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping glass under the chin; and the cupping glass on the two shoulders; and the cupping glass on the buttocks; and the cupping glasses in the middle of the two arms; and the cupping glasses on the two legs; and the cupping glasses on the two ankles; and cupping does not draw blood, except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore one is not weakened by it, as one is by bleeding a vein; and it should not be administered, either with fire or without fire, in any illness that comes from plethora, until the whole body is emptied.

[3] []
And if by necessity of illness it is necessary to cup, or by habit, we administer it every time at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between and at any time; for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head; and there are some who find fullness and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes; and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and cough up blood; and there are some who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.

[] [4]
The latter, cupping without scarification, may be carried out in two ways: with fire and without fire.

[] [5]
 The points at which cupping with scarification and extraction of blood is performed are fourteen places in the body: the occiput, which is the back of the head; the interscapular region, which is the middle of the back of the neck; the two sides of the neck, equally on both sides; the chin, that is, beneath the lower jaw; the two shoulders; the coccyx, at the base of the tail; the antibrachium, the middle of the forearms; the two legs; and the two heel-veins.

[] [6]
 What cupping does is to draw blood out of the fine vessels dispersed over the flesh; for this reason it does not cause the strength to decline as does venesection; nor may you use cupping, either with fire or without fire, in any disease due to plethora, until the whole body has been evacuated.

[] [7]
If disease or custom prescribe cupping we may apply it at any hour, at the beginning or end or middle of the month, at whatever time it may be.

[] [8]
For there are some people who, when there is an abundance of blood in them, so as to need cupping, feel heaviness and pain in the head.

[] [9]
Some find they have a fullness and redness of the face and also of the head and neck; some have an itching in their face and forehead and a dimness and irritation in their eyes.

[] [10]
There are some who scratch the places where the cupping-vessels are applied; some laugh immoderately; some find a taste of blood in the mouth, and the gums swell up and they spit blood; some sleep overmuch; some frequently dream of seeing blood and redness and murdered men and wounds and the like.

[] [24]
The application of cupping to the inside of the forearms helps in place of venesection of the three veins, namely the basilic, median, and cephalic; for it draws blood from all the capillaries of the flesh.

[] [32]
The advantage of cupping of the heel-veins is much the same as that of the legs.

[] [36]
Tell him who applies the cupping-vessels to scarify rather widely and deeply, and to control the suction with gentleness and a delicate motion.

[] [40]
If we judge that the blood is thick we should scarify deeply.

[24] []
The cups that are placed without scarification are those that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen, and for gout, and on the belly and the buttock and the loins and the hip, because these parts do not tolerate scarification on the eyes, and it is only done with fire to draw blood from one part to another, as we place them on the breasts when the nose bleeds; to remove the viscosity that is in the part, as we place cups on the belly and on the buttocks to reduce the part; and remove the pain, when there is blockage or stone, thus it removes by its attractive power perhaps the blockage, or loosens the stone from its place; and so it does when it is placed on the liver and on the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cups are applied empty to only suck; and sometimes they are applied together with fire, and sometimes filled with lukewarm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a way that the cup is filled with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled for this.

[] [58]
 Cupping without scarification is the cupping practised on the liver, the spleen, the breasts, the belly, the umbilicus, the region of the kidneys and the acetabulum of the femur; for these parts do not tolerate scarification.

[] [59]
Now the purpose of the vessels is either to draw blood from one part to another, as when we apply cups over the breasts in the case of nose-bleed; or to loosen from the part a frigid vapour that has become fixed in it, as when we place cupping-vessels on the abdomen and umbilicus; for they stimulate the part and warm it and remove the pain because they loosen the vapour.

[] [60]
Sometimes they are applied over the kidneys when there is an obstruction or stones in them; for often, by virtue of their drawing, the obstruction is opened up or the stones are dislodged from their site.

[] [61]
They act in the same way when they are applied over the liver and the spleen when flatus is permeating them.

[] [62]
These cupping-vessels may be used empty with suction only; or they may be used with fire.

[] [63]
Sometimes in pleuritic complaints they are applied filled with tepid water.

[] [64]
This is done by filling the vessel, which should be large, with plain hot water, or with hot water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.

[] [65]
Then it is applied to the place, full, and held there, then removed; and the process repeated as often as is necessary.

[26] []
And it should be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and have on the side around the middle a small hole, just enough to insert a needle, and be made of brass, smooth in front so that it does not hurt the patient when placed on the limb; and have in the middle a crossbar of brass or iron, to place a lit candle, and they should be both large and small according to the illnesses and the age of those who receive them; for the cups for children are different than for the old, and for the thin than for the fat.

[27] []
And one should place this cup on the limb thus: take the candle of wax or a wick, and place it in the middle of the cup across the bar which is in the middle of the cup, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cup so that it does not burn the patient; and then place it on the limb, and your finger should be on the hole that we mentioned, so that when one wants, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cup; and one takes the wick as before, and repeats it often, if you have need.

[] [67]
Its mouth should be the width of two opened fingers, as we have illustrated; the depth should be half a span; and in the side about halfway down there should be a small hole of a size to admit a needle.

[] [68]
It should be made of Chinese bronze or of brass.

[] [69]
The edge should be thick, smooth, even, and polished, so as not to injure the part to which it is applied.

[] [70]
And in the middle there should be a transverse rod of bronze or iron to carry the lighted lamp.

[] [71]
You may make this kind of cupping-vessel in a large size, larger than we have described; and in a small size too, to suit various ailments and the age of the user.

[] [72]
For the cupping-vessels for boys and thin persons differ from those for men and stout persons.

[] [73]
 Now this is the manner of applying this cupping-vessel with fire to a part of the body.

[] [74]
You set light to a strongly twisted wick of linen or a small wax candle, and you set it on the middle of the cross-piece in the middle of the vessel so that the flame be directed toward the lower part of the cupping vessel and not burn the patient's body.

[] [75]
Then the vessel should be placed on the part with the finger kept over the above-mentioned hole; then when we have held the vessel sufficiently long there the finger is taken away, the vapour will come out through the hole, and the vessel will become loosened at once.

[] [76]
Then light the wick as prescribed and repeat if necessary.

[] [79]
Now the larger this cupping-vessel is, to hold much water, the better.

 CHAPTER NINETY-SEVEN.

[] [1]
On the application of leeches.

[] [2]
 Leeches are mostly used on those parts of the body to which application of cupping-vessels is impossible, either because of their smallness, such as the lips, the gums, and so on; or because the part is bare of flesh, like the finger, the nose, and so on.

[] [3]
This is the way to use them: you seek some leeches that are in fresh water free of dirt.

[] [8]
If the blood continues to run after the leeches have fallen off, and becomes an ooze, let linen dressings be wetted with cold water and apply them over the place until the oozing stops.

[] [9]
But if the bleeding be serious then sprinkle upon the place powdered vitriol or gall or similar styptics, until the haemorrhage is stopped.

[] [10]
Or let split shelled beans be applied to the place and left until they stick there, and then the bleeding will stop.

[] [11]
If it is necessary to repeat the application, the same leech should not be applied but another one if you possibly can.

 BOOK THREE

[] [1]
 ON BONE-SETTING

[2] []
Know, dear son, that fools remove themselves from this chapter, because they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read a letter of them; and for this reason science is diminished in our land, for I never found anyone good at it; and I know nothing about it, except through the knowledge of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have drawn the science from them, and through experience, and through the practice of my life; and I have described for you in this chapter what is contained, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two previous chapters.

[] [3]
You should know, my sons, that ignorant practitioners and laymen and those who have never turned the pages of a single book of the Ancients about it, nor studied a single letter of it, arrogate this part of the art to themselves.

[] [4]
For this reason this section of the science has died out in our parts; I have myself found no one competent in it; and whatever skill I have, I have derived for myself by my long reading of the books of the Ancients and my thirst to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.

[] [5]
Then through the whole of my life I have adhered to experience and practice.

[] [6]
So now I have described for you in this book all that my knowledge has encompassed on the subject and that my experience has encountered; I have made it accessible for you and rescued it from the abyss of prolixity; I have reduced it to a brief outline; and have explained it most clearly.

[] [7]
I have made for you many drawings of the instruments that are used in it, which is an adjunct to explanation, as I did in the two previous books.

[] [8]
And there is no power save in God the High, the Great.

chapter-3-subchapter-1.txt

 CHAPTER ONE.

[] [1]
In which is given the necessary compendious preliminary information on fractures.

[1] []
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or sprain or bruise happens to someone, you must hasten to treat the patient on both sides, unless something prevents you entirely, such as weakness of the body, or infancy, or old age; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold; and prescribe cold things, that is to say cold broths, and the meat of birds and kid, and do not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not overfill with foods that fill the veins with blood, as long as you have no fear of a hot abscess, or of spreading of matter in the limb; then the patient should return to his former diet that he was used to.

[] [3]
So I say that when anyone has sustained a fracture or dislocation or luxation or fall, you should first hasten to venesect him, or get his bowel open, or both, if there be nothing to hinder such as physical weakness, or unless it be a small boy or a very old man to whom an accident of this kind has happened; or unless the weather be excessively hot or cold.

[] [4]
Next, let his diet be restricted to cold vegetables and the flesh of fowl and kids; he is to be forbidden wine and rich meat and gluttony and all foods that fill out the blood-vessels, until you are sure that there is no abscess and see no reason to suspect a flux of matter to the place.

[] [5]
Then let the patient return to his former diet according to his custom.

[17] []
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and the like: these should be wrapped with bandages of soft and fine linen; and those that are large, such as the thigh and leg: these should be wrapped with a wide and strong bandage, for the wide bandage embraces the whole large limb, and constricts it evenly on all sides, so that there is no blemish; then tie around it light padding, three or four turns depending on the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the whole bandage, then go above the break and tighten less, further away from the break; and loosen the bandage little by little, until you cover a large part of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and wrap it again over the broken area; then go back to the part below the break, and tighten moderately, not too tight nor too loose, as we said in the first bandage above; then place between the bandages linen padding or cloths, until it is all even, then tie a bandage over it all, and then place your well-made splints on top, if there is no abscess or swelling.

[] [31]
The strips of bandage for those that are small, such as an arm or finger or forearm or the like, should be soft and fine, while those that are thick, such as the hip, back, or breast, should have broad and strong bandages.

[] [32]
For a broad bandage holds fast to a big limb, binding it all round with an even pressure so that no defect may occur.

[] [33]
Then, after you have finished the setting, begin by applying a suitable liniment on soft tow over the site of the fracture, then start to wrap the bandage over the actual site, three or four turns of bandage as the part may require, winding it fairly tight.

[] [34]
Then carry on the bandage above the site of the fracture, winding it more loosely than on the fractured place, and continue a little with the bandaging beyond the place of fracture, loosening the tension gradually, until you have taken up a good amount of the sound part.

[] [35]
Then take another bandage and wind it several turns over the fracture and then carry it over the part below the fracture, the tightness and looseness being arranged in the same way that we prescribed for the first covering, of the upper part.

[] [36]
Then put between the bandages enough soft tow or soft rags to correct the curves of the fracture, if any; otherwise put nothing in.

[] [37]
Then wind over it another bandage and at once lay over it strong splints, if the part be not swollen and effused.

[19] []
but the splint that is placed over the break must be a little thicker and wider than the others; and be as long as is necessary for the limb, whether small or large; then tighten over the splints as you did with the first bandage, then tie a thread over it appropriately, as in the first bandage over the break; tighter above, gradually less so; and the threads must be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen; for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bandages of twisted linen cords, and that is a great error, because the bandage cannot be even if it is too tight, and there should not be less than a finger's width between each splint.

[] [40]
The size of each splint should be of this form and shape, except that the splint that is placed on the fracture itself should be a little thicker and broader than the others.

[] [41]
As to the length of the splint, it should be greater or less as suits the fractured part.

[] [42]
Figure of a splint.

[] [43]
Then bind over the splints another bandage just as tightly as you did your first; then over that tie it up with cords arranged in the way we have said, that is, with the pressure greatest over the site of the fracture and lessened as you move away from it.

[] [44]
The cords should be of medium thickness, of linen supple of quality.

[] [45]
For if the cords are too thick, such as I have seen ignorant people use who made their cords of twisted bands of linen, that will be a grave error, for moderate tension with these is impossible.

[] [46]
Nor are fine threads suitable either, for with these you cannot achieve sufficient tension.

[] [47]
Between splints there should be a space of not less than a finger's breadth.

[] [54]
Pound it as it is without sieving, with egg-white, to a medium consistency; then use.

[36] []
And then unbind it a little later, and take care if the patient feels any pain, or if the bone has moved from its place; if not, do not unbind it for several days. And if pain comes to the area, or itching, without rest or swelling, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately; and take a light cloth, and a moist sea sponge, and dip it in water, and wash the area, until the itching stops, and the pain is soothed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then apply dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind it overnight, until you are sure of a warm abscess; and the inflammation of the limb subsides, and the pain is removed, then begin the bandaging again gently, and a little plaster, and do not tighten it as much as before; and continue gently until it is healed.

[] [68]
As to the length of time the bandages should remain on before being loosened: you should keep an eye on the patient and if he suffers no pain or itching or any shifting of the broken bone, then they should not be loosened for a number of days; but if he experiences at the place a violent itching or a disturbing pain or swelling, then hasten to loosen them and make no delay; and remove the plaster.

[] [69]
Then you must take a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge and dip it in tepid water and bathe the place until the itching subsides and the pain settles; then let the limb rest for an hour; then apply to it raw wool soaked in oil and vinegar or oil of roses, and bandage it on for one night until you are sure there is no effusion and the swelling of the limb has subsided and the pain has gone.

[] [70]
Then put the bandage on again gently, and a light plaster; do not bind it up as you did at the first but go gently with it until it heal.

[38] []
And if none of what we have said happens to the limb, do not unbind it until after three days or four or five or seven; and sometimes leave it for twenty days, depending on what is observed, until the break dries, and the joining of the flesh approaches; then tighten it more than before, and increase his food, as I have said before; and if you see the area drying out more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot reach it; then moisten it with warm tepid water, every time you unbind it, and this should be every third day, and loosen the bandage a little; by this work, then, nourishment flows to the limb, and quickly corrects what foolish physicians do, who set the limb crookedly: this is bad, and it is also dangerous work, and I see nothing else to do but to leave it and work correctly.

[] [72]
But if none of these things that we have mentioned occur, then do not loosen it until after three, four, or five days or a week; sometimes it may be left up to twenty days, depending on how the limb appears to you, as we said, until the fracture be united and the flesh over it be near to joining.

[] [73]
Then bandage more tightly than before, and increase the heaviness of the patient's food as has been mentioned.

[] [74]
If you see the place of the fracture getting more dry and thin than it should, you may know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it; so foment it with tepid water each time you loosen it; do this every three days, and ease the bandaging somewhat.

[] [75]
This action makes nourishment flow to the limb and it will quickly heal.

[] [76]
 What some ignorant bone-setters do is to break the bone again if at first the repair is not as it should be and has mended crookedly.

[] [77]
This operation of theirs is mistaken and dangerous; if it were right the Ancients would undoubtedly have spoken of it in their books and would have used it.

[] [78]
But I have not found a trace of it in a single one of them; and the right course is not to use it.

 CHAPTER TWO.

[] [1]
On a fracture occurring in the head.

[13] []
And if the bone fracture reaches the membrane that covers the brain, you must cut the fractured part like this: and that is, you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in all the ways that you can, and over the shape of the wound as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs when uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, help him with what is necessary, and that is that you fill the place with cloths soaked in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess is soothed, and you are sure of the bleeding; then begin to remove the bone around it, and this is done according to two methods of work: one way is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:

[] [19]
If the fracture has already reached the cerebral membrane with fragmentation of the bone and depression, then you must cut out the splintered and broken part as I shall now describe to you.

[] [20]
Shave the head of the injured patient and lay the bone bare in any way you can, following the course of the injury and in the manner least grievous to the injured man.

[] [21]
If, when you lay the bone bare, you encounter a haemorrhage or abscess, meet the case with suitable remedies; that is, pack the place with dressings soaked in wine and oil of roses, and cleanse the wound until the swelling subsides and you are safe from haemorrhage; then begin the trepanning and removal of the bone.

[] [22]
This may be done in one of two ways.

[] [23]
One way is to cut the bone with a fine-bladed chisel, this being the figure of it.

[] [24]
Then after this one employ another chisel, a little broader.

[] [25]
It is figured here.

[] [32]
Here are figured three kinds of drill, large, medium, and small.

[25] []
And if the meninges are exposed, you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth folded in two or three, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and put it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so as not to aggravate the meninges, then apply another bandage over it, and do not tighten it except enough to hold the wound only; and leave it like this for a day or two, until the inflammatory swelling has subsided, then untie it, and apply medications such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and incense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things; and make a powder of these things, and put it on the wound, and always apply cleansing medications without causticity; and ensure that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave the ointment there, nor let pus collect, for when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrodes and rots it, and great harm comes to the patient; for when something caustic is put on the meninges, it blackens on top. 

[] [47]
If the meninges are left bare when you remove the bone, you should take a linen dressing measured to the wound, soak it in oil of roses, and apply it to the opening of the wound; then take another dressing, folded in two or three, soak it in wine and oil of roses and apply it over the first with the utmost gentleness so as not to press upon the meninges; then employ a broad bandage on top, but tighten it only enough to keep the wound covered.

[] [48]
Leave it with this dressing on for a day or two until you are sure there is no abscess; then loosen it and apply desiccant remedies such as lily roots, vetch-flour, powdered frankincense, birthwort, and the like.

[] [49]
The method is that you make a powder of these drugs and sprinkle it, dry as it is, upon the wound; in short, in these cases use drugs whose nature is cleansing and not irritating.

[] [50]
In this be most diligent, that the wound, while you are treating it, be clean; nor let there be any dirty vestiges of ointment in it or any filth; and let no pus collect in it; for when pus collects on the meninges it corrupts them and renders them necrotic, which causes great harm to the patient.

and it resembles a spoon, and is not pointed, and is as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the nature of the work; and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, like the opening of the wound that you made when you extracted the bones; and when you are certain of a hot abscess, then sew the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with cloths and tents, according to its size.

[] [13]
It resembles a spoon but without a hollow.

[] [14]
It should be as broad as you need, having regard to the size of the bone, and as long as you can use at operation.

[] [15]
As you see, it should be provided with one wide and one narrow extremity.

[] [16]
If the opening you made when you extracted the splinter of bone be wide and you feel safe against an abscess, suture the edges together.

[] [17]
But if the opening be small or you fear an abscess, pack the wound with material and pads proportional to the opening.

[8] []
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without incision, is that you apply to the bone a plaster of mill dust and egg white, and put light compresses on top, and put a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very large bandage, a palm wide, then put a double cloth over the compresses and the plaster; then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around this bandage, so that the ends of the bandage are hanging; and place the splint over the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit; and bring it back from each side, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture properly, and you see clearly that the splint does not move over the broken bone, then check it every day, and when the bandage loosens, tighten it; and have the patient lie on his back, and when he sleeps put a small pillow under his armpit to raise the shoulder; this will alleviate the clavicle fracture by elevating the shoulder, or you can tie his arm to his neck, and do not untie it unless some bad accident occurs, for up to twenty days; then reapply the plaster, if you see that it is needed, and tighten it and leave it like that, until it is healed; and it is healed in twenty-eight days at most, and in fewer for some people.

[] [19]
As to bandaging the bone when it is without wound or incision, it is thus: apply over the bone the plaster composed of mill-dust with egg-white and put over it soft tow; then put a pad in his axilla if necessary; then take a very long sling about a span broad; then place a doubled pad over the tow and plaster; then take a splint made of thin board; its width should be three fingers and its length the same; then wrap it in a rag; then wrap the rag together with the splint in that part of the sling that is over the site of the fracture; then tie the sling round the fracture and wind it round his neck and under his sound axilla and under his injured axilla and carry it several times in every direction as you judge best that the bandaging will hold the fracture firmly, for it will be apparent to you.

[] [20]
The whole point is that the splint should not slip from over the fracture; so you should examine the patient every day, and whenever the bandage has loosened and you see the splint has shifted, then put it right and tighten the bandage.

[] [21]
Make the patient sleep lying on his back, and at night when he is asleep place a small bolster under the axilla so as to raise his arm from his side, for with the raising of the humerus the fracture of the clavicle will be elevated.

[] [22]
Or bind his arm to his neck.

[] [23]
Do not loosen the bandage for twelve days unless there arise at the place any pruritus or swelling.

[] [24]
Then renew the plaster if you think it necessary, and bandage again and leave until the fracture of the collar-bone is set and knits.

[] [25]
The majority of these cases are firm and strong in twenty-eight days, though in some people it takes less.

 CHAPTER six.

[1] []
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks in a wide place or in the middle, and it is not known except by touch; so treat it according to the nature of the fracture, and reset it according to its natural form, in all the ways that you can; then place on the area mill dust with egg white, and light compresses, and put on a double cloth; then put on a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint there is a hollow in any place on the shoulder, fill that hollow with linen compresses, so that the splint sits evenly; and then bind it tightly with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day; and every time it loosens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on his side; and the shoulder is healed in twenty or twenty-five days. And when this period is complete, untie it, and be confident, for this is not a bone that is easily dislocated.

[] [2]
The scapula is rarely fractured in the broad part but it does break at its margins.

[] [3]
When any part of it is broken or it breaks in the middle (which is recognized by palpation) you should attempt the correction of the fracture according to the shape it takes, and its restoration to its natural form, by whatever means you can.

[] [4]
Then apply over the place mill-dust with eggwhite, and soft tow; and over that a dressing made of a folded cloth; and over that a broad splint made of thin board to the size of the whole scapula or a little wider.

[] [5]
If there be beneath the splint a hollow in any part of the scapula, level it with soft tow so that the splint rests evenly.

[] [6]
Then bind tightly over it a long sling and make sure that the splint does not slip out of place.

[] [7]
Examine the bandage daily; and whenever it gets loose tighten it and adjust the splint if it has shifted.

[] [8]
The patient should lie on his sound side.

[] [9]
The scapula mends in twenty or twenty-five days.

[] [10]
When this time has elapsed you may safely loosen the bandaging, for this is one of the bones in which there is no danger of fragmentation or cracking.

 CHAPTER SEVEN.

[3] []
And the restoration is such that the patient often lies on his back, and you place a cushion between the shoulder blades, then press on the shoulders, and bring together the ribs of both sides with your hands, and strive to put them evenly in all the ways you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be; then place plasters and padding on a thin splint of willow, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and wrap the bandage around the back, and tighten it suitably, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it; and if it needs to be undone, because of infection or itching that comes to the area, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and undo it, and remove the plaster, and address whatever has developed there in terms of treatment; then replace the plaster, and tighten it until he is healed.

[] [4]
Now the way to mend it is for the patient to lie on his back, and you place a pillow between his shoulders; then his shoulders are squeezed, and with your hands you press together his ribs from both sides and skilfully try to equalize them in any way you conveniently can, until the bone is reduced to its proper form.

[] [5]
Then apply over it a plaster and a pad and place over that a splint of thin willow board or brier or similar light wood, first wrapping it in cloth; then gently bind this upon the fractured bone so that it does not slip; and carry your bandage round about the back several times, tying it firmly; then inspect it constantly, and whenever it loosens tighten it.

[] [6]
If you are compelled to loosen it on account of itching at the place, or pain or swelling, loosen it quickly and remove the plaster and correct whatever has occurred with the appropriate treatment.

[] [7]
Then renew the plaster if you think fit, and keep it bandaged until it heals.

If there be any splinters in the bone or anything crumbles away from the extremities, it must not be pulled out or touched, but set externally as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.

And if no such problem arises, do not unbind it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, with his hands on his stomach; and place a cushion filled evenly with wool under the shoulder, and check every hour of the day or night that the shape of the broken limb does not change, or that the bandaging is not loosened; adjust it skillfully with medical expertise, and give him the food that we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is initially light; and when he begins to recover, it should be richer.

[] [24]
But if you are confident that nothing of this sort is happening then do not loosen the bandaging until after many days.

[] [25]
The patient should be made to sleep on his back with his hand on his stomach, and under the humerus there should be placed a cushion evenly filled with wool.

[] [26]
And examine it at all times of the day and night lest the shape of the broken limb suffer any deformity or the binding loosen; do your utmost to put any such thing right.

[] [27]
You should also direct the patient's diet along the line that we have given earlier; namely, at first the food should be light until the bone has begun to knit; then you should order heavier food.

If it is the ulna that breaks, he must employ stronger traction on it.

[] [10]
If both bones break he must employ very strong traction.

[9] []
And then remove the cerate, and apply a poultice of mill dust with plenty of egg, then place the splints, and the splint on the break should always be stronger, and a bit wider than the others; and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several arrangements: whether the break is in one of the bones, or in two; and tighten more over the break than elsewhere, and always less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and the cloths that are on the break should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and the thread with which it is tied should be linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said. 

[] [20]
 You should know that the number of splints for an arm is, as a rule, six, whether the fracture be of one bone or of both together.

[] [21]
Then bandage more tightly and strongly over the site of the fracture, and, as you wrap the bandage above and below the fracture, bind little by little more loosely according to the instruction given at the beginning of the book.

[] [22]
The dressings wound round the fracture should be gentle and soft, not very hard, while the cord for binding is best made of linen of medium thickness as we have prescribed.

And if the fracture occurs at any of the knuckles of the fingers, if it's the thumb, set it evenly as needed; and tighten it with the palm, and if you wish, put a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and so it doesn't move; and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index or one of the others, set it evenly, and tie it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or you tie them all together, which is better, or you put on a splint, as with the thumb; and be wary of the restoration and the disposition of hot abscesses, and treat what arises there, as I have said.

[] [9]
 The fracture may occur to one of the small bones of the fingers.

[] [10]
If it be the thumb, then set it in the proper way and bind it down to the palm of the hand; if you like you can apply a small straight splint to it to keep the fracture straight so that it does not shift.

[] [11]
If the break be in any of the other fingers, such as the middle or index or little finger or the ring finger, straighten it out and bind it to the sound finger next to it; or let them all be bound up one to another, which is better; or apply a small straight splint, as we said for the thumb.

[] [12]
While you are setting it, and afterwards, look out for an effusion and counteract it with what is required if anything of this sort occur, according to what has been repeatedly prescribed.

On setting a fracture of the femur.

[6] []
You must wrap a hard bandage, doubled in two or three, over the break, and leave the excess, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the base of the buttock, and put a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and the ends of the thread should come to the top; then turn the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then place splints over the break, and place a splint over the leg bone; then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to evenly distribute the pressure, then begin to tightly tie three or four turns over the break; and the higher you go above the break, the less you tighten; then pull on the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and thigh, and tie the three splints that are on top, then go back down to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot; and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like that, as long as no abscess, swelling, or anything similar develops.

[] [10]
 As to the bandaging, you should wrap a firm broad sash two or three times round the fracture, leaving some over; then bind the leg up so that the heel is brought to reach the root of the buttock.

[] [11]
Then pass a long cord in the space between the thigh and the leg, low down near the knee, and let the ends of the cord come up on either side, then bind the rest of the sash over the leg and the thigh.

[] [12]
Then apply splints to the thigh at the very site of the fracture and put one of the splints on the leg-bone.

[] [13]
Then pack soft material in the space between the leg and the thigh to make the bandaging even.

[] [14]
Then start with three or four turns of a strong bandage in the middle over the site of the fracture, and as you get away from the site of the fracture bind lighter and softer and looser.

[] [15]
Then turn to the two ends of the cord which you previously passed between the thigh and the leg, and with the cord bind the adjacent splints above, then carry the ends downward until you end up at the great tendon of the foot and with them bind also the extremities of the splints at the other end so that the bandaging will not shift from its place.

of the arm).

[5] []
And when you have completed all your work, take two curved wooden boards that enclose the leg on either side, and they should be the length of the leg from the knee down; then wrap a bandage over it in two places, above and below, and tie it in the middle too, and with this binding the leg will not be able to bend to the right or left, and thus it is good; and some apply a cradle the length of the leg, and it is made of wood, and the leg is placed in it to prevent movement, and this is done especially in a fracture where there is a wound; and move the leg every day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other complication; treat it until it is healed.

[] [12]
The operation on the leg involves one more process than that on the arm, namely, that when you have set the splints and have finished the task, you should take two strips of pine wood such as are used for roofing upstairs rooms, being put in the gaps of the planking, or they may be palm stalks; pick out such as are somewhat thick and not too thin; they should be as long as the leg from the knee down.

[] [13]
Then wrap each of them in a cloth folded into two longitudinally, and put one on each side of the leg; they should reach from the knee to the extremity of the foot.

[] [14]
Then tie the two strips in three places, namely at the two ends and in the middle; this binding prevents the leg from bending to right or left and it will be held in a good straight position.

[] [15]
Sometimes a 'gutter-splint' is used, made of wood according to the length of the leg; the leg is placed in this and it keeps the leg motionless.

[] [16]
This is particularly necessary in a compound fracture.

[] [17]
Then carefully examine the leg every day and use the utmost care to guard against effusion or swelling or other like things; and when anything of this sort happens employ the means to meet the case until it heals.

[] [18]
The bone of the leg mends in thirty days or so.

When the pubic bone of a woman is broken, have her sit spread-legged, then lean her towards her back, and have her held from behind; then the attendant fills the patient's vagina with cotton, and puts in as much as a fist; then have the woman stand up, and raise her back little by little, and then the cotton will jump out, until it comes to the opening of the vagina, and the bone returns with the fist; and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back in, and do this for seven days or thereabouts: the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a tube to the opening, and insert the whole bladder into the vagina; then blow strongly into the tube, until the bladder is inflated inside: the vagina will return the fracture; then fill it with cotton, and leave it like that for a few days, until it is healed.

[] [2]
 When a woman's pudenda are fractured, make her sit cross-legged, then bend her backwards little by little, being supported from behind.

[] [3]
Then let a midwife pack the vulva with cotton wool so as to form a kind of spherical packing in the vulva.

[] [4]
Then shake the woman and by degrees elevate the dorsal spine, for the cotton wool will emerge until it is like a sphere at the opening and the fractured bone will be reduced.

[] [5]
Then put a pillow upon her back and when she wants to pass water gently remove the cotton wool so she may do so, then put it back in the same way in which it was put in at the first.

[] [6]
Then she should return to her pillow as before.

[] [7]
She should do this for about seven days, then it will be mended.

[] [8]
If you prefer, take a sheep's bladder and bind a hollow reed to the opening of it; introduce the whole bladder into the pudenda and then blow hard into the tube so that the bladder is inflated within the passage and the fracture will then be reduced.

[] [9]
Then pack with cotton wool and let her wait a few days as we have described, until it be healed.

So work until it is in its place, then wet a cloth in dark, astringent wine, and especially if it is in summer; and do not put on the wound cerate or anything else with oil, lest it cause pus and corruption; then apply splints when you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted with the fracture; and many times foolish physicians have done this, and have caused the patient to die or sometimes suffer a corrosive infection; and let the bandaging be softer and gentler than for other fractures.

[] [18]
If you can restore it to its natural site, do so, for you will render the patient a signal service.

[] [19]
 When your setting of the bone is complete, soak a dressing in dark sharp wine, especially if it be in summer, but do not put wax or anything oily upon the wound lest it cause putrefaction or corruption.

[] [20]
Then apply splints the moment you have finished setting the bone; and leave the wound open, that is, by making with scissors an opening in the coverings the size of the wound.

[] [21]
And take the utmost care not to bandage up a wound with a fracture; for many ignorant doctors have done that, thereby causing their patients either death or ulceration or a defluxion; so make your bandage soft and loose, as opposed to that of other fractures.

On the treatment of the callus that remains from a fracture.

[2] []
Take care then if the knot is fresh: administer to it styptic medicines, such as aloe, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and other similar ones, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and cook them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and put them on at night in cloths, and bind it tightly, and do not untie it for several days; and then untie it, and start again, until the nodule is removed; or you tighten over it a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs; and if the nodule has already turned into a hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, cut over it, and remove the apparent excess; or you send it to a barber/surgeon, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.

[] [3]
Examine it, and if the callus be soft, apply astringent remedies to it, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, balsam of sarcocol, acacia, and the like.

[] [4]
Take some or all of these; beat them up with a dry wine or egg-white or vinegar, apply to the callus on some tow and bind up firmly.

[] [5]
Leave the bandaging on for many days; then undo it and repeat until the callus is removed, God willing.

[] [6]
Or bind on it a firm sheet of lead; for lead has the property of taking away lumps from limbs.

[] [7]
But if the callus is stony hard and its removal is urgent, incise the place and cut away the superfluous prominence, or pare it away with a scraper until it is gone; and dress the wound until it heals.

of the limb crooked after healing

[1] []
When the limb is crooked after restoration, and the bone broken openly, and the shape of the limb is ugly, yet it does not lose its natural function: do not believe the fools who say that the limb must be re-broken, and many foolish doctors have done this in our land; and this work is condemned, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death; however, if the knots and the crookedness are fresh, they should be watered with hot water, in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar things; and make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of marshmallow, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and make a plaster on it; or take ripe figs, and crush them with dove droppings, and similar medicines that soften the callus.

 CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO.

[] [1]
On the treatment of fractured bones when they mend crooked and are inhibited from their proper functioning.

[] [2]
When a limb that has been set has some distortion after healing, or the bone that was broken has some prominence or callosity, so that the limb is deformed, but there is nevertheless no limitation of its natural movement, then you should not listen to those who think that the bone should be broken again.

[] [3]
In our parts there have been many ignorant doctors and bone-setters who have done this.

[] [4]
The operation is most blameworthy and leads to great dangers, death itself not being the worst possibility.

[] [5]
But if the distortion and callosity be recent you should massage it with an infusion of the herbs that have an emollient quality, such as leaves and roots of the marsh mallow, and melilot and the like: and apply one of the emollient plasters such as carefully prepared diachylon.

[] [6]
Or take mucilage of the root of the marsh mallow and beat it up with chicken fat and oil of sesame, and let a cataplasm of these be applied.

[] [7]
Or take a fat fig and beat it up with pigeon's dung; and the like remedies that are termed 'inhibitors of scarring'.

[] [6]
But in those of a fleshy build it is the opposite; it comes out with difficulty and goes back with difficulty.

[4] []
And the dislocation is recognized when it is down towards the armpit, and compare the injured shoulder with the healthy one, and you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring their hand to their nose, nor move it in any way; and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly by touch; and this type of dislocation is not difficult to reduce when it is recent, or if the patient is a child.

[] [9]
A dislocation down into the axilla may be diagnosed by comparing the sound and the dislocated humerus; for you will find an obvious difference between them; you will find a hollow at the head of the humerus, and in the axilla the head of the humerus may be palpated like an egg, and the patient is unable to lift his hand to his ear, and full movements are restricted.

[] [10]
Similarly if it is displaced toward the breast or upward you will find it obvious to the touch and not hidden.

[] [11]
The reduction of this dislocation will be quite simple if it be only recent or the patient be a child.

[] [13]
If it is not reduced by the means we have stated, being a dislocation of many days' standing, the patient should take a hot bath and use relaxing and softening fomentations, such as decoction of marsh mallow root and fenugreek and melilot.

[] [18]
the ground a long spar of wood; its head should be of a round shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither massive nor slender; then after a soft pad has been put on the head of the spar it should be placed under the axilla of the patient, who should be standing alongside the spar; then let his hand be drawn downward on one side and his body on the other, powerfully.

[] [19]
Then the joint will immediately return to its place.

[] [20]
 If it proves difficult to reduce it by any of the means we have stated, employ this treatment: take a wooden spar some two cubits in length, two fingers thick, and four wide; it should have a round head to facilitate its introduction into the hollow of the axilla; of this shape.

And if it does not want to return to its place, apply strong traction; two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should hold him so that he does not move during the traction; then turn the arm in each direction, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth around it; and when the physician has grasped the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly until it returns; and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm around the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days, then untie it.

[] [9]
 If the dislocation does not respond to reduction, apply very strong and powerful extension.

[] [10]
For this, let two assistants pull on the arm while two other assistants hold the patient against the extension.

[] [11]
Then the arm should be rotated in all directions after the limb has been wrapped in a long folded cloth or a broad wrapper.

[] [12]
When the doctor begins manipulating the joint he should anoint his hands with oil so as to assist, by its lubrication, the movement of the joint; then he should thrust the joint powerfully until it goes back.

[] [13]
After its reduction he should apply to it a plaster having some styptic and absorbent qualities, with egg-white; and put on a firm bandage and suspend the patient's arm from his neck and leave it for some days.

Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated in any direction, sometimes on the back of the hand or the palm; then stretch the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to place, then support the tip of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed; and leave it for two days, and then straighten it that day; and at night tie it, as we have said, and untie it during the day, and make him move it, and re-tie it at night; and do this often, until it is strong, and do the same if it is dislocated on the palm side of the hand, and do as you did before, until it is healed; and do the same when it is dislocated in another direction.

 CHAPTER THIRTY.

[4] []
I say that in the gibbosity that comes to the worst in front, there is no remedy or healing; and also that which comes directly on both sides, and one cannot treat except that which comes properly on the back, as I said; and it is that the patient be stretched out on their face in an even place, and has support underneath, so that they are not injured; then firmly fix a stake at the head in the ground, and another at the feet, and tie a cord under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles; and two assistants pull the cords, one at the head and the other at the feet, through the two stakes; and they should be well secured, the stakes as we have said, and the physician puts his palms firmly on the spine, until it returns to place.

[] [10]
 I say then, that in a curvature occurring forward there is no technique or cure for it.

[] [11]
And likewise in a curvature laterally.

[] [12]
The only curvature that can be treated is that of the dorsal spine exclusively, by the means I now describe.

[] [13]
The patient should be stretched prone upon a level bench near a wall, and a soft palliasse should be spread under him so that his chest may not be hurt.

[] [14]
Then put a straight spar, set in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench where his head is, and another spar where his feet are at the other end of the bench.

[] [15]
Let an assistant hold this spar, which is not to be firmly fixed in the hole, while another assistant holds the other in the same way.

[] [16]
Then wind round the patient's chest and beneath his axillae a soft strong wrapper, and stretch one end of the wrapper to the spar at his head, and tie it to it.

[] [17]
Then bind other wrappers: over his hips, his knees, and by both tendons of Achilles; then bring the wrappers together and tie them to the other spar at his feet.

[] [18]
Then each assistant extends the spar with the tie towards himself; the two spars will not shift from their places in which they are planted, but, as we have said, they are not to be fixed.

[] [19]
Meanwhile the doctor is to press hard with both his palms upon the spine until it goes back; or he may place a board upon it and apply pressure to the board with his feet until it goes back.

[6] []
And you should fix two stakes at the head of the patient, a cubit high, and towards the feet two others, and have between each stake, above and below, a handspan of space in length; and each stake should have a hole, where the winch runs, and the stakes should be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move; and between each two stakes there should be a turning stake, on which the cords turn, and there should be on the two turning stakes two small stakes a handspan long, to turn the winch; and then tie the cord that is through the armpits to the winch towards the head, and the other cord towards the feet to the other winch, and each of the assistants turns his winch with all the cord, and the master puts the spine straight as we have said.

[7] []
And when it is straight, apply a desiccative plaster with plenty of egg, and then the padding, and then the splint from a board three fingers long, so that it covers the place of the gibbosity and the healthy part of the vertebra, then tie it with a cord, as we have said, and the patient consumes a light diet, until they are healed; and if anything arises at the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we mentioned before; and sometimes a piece of lead is applied there, and sometimes the appearance arises in the last vertebra of the back, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone that protrudes, for which one should not have presumption: by chance it would cause death.

[] [21]
 If you wish you may operate by means of a winch turned by hand; thus: you fix in the ground at the head of the patient, at one end of the bench, two wooden spars each one cubit long; and the same at the lower end, at his feet; there should be the distance of a span between the spars (of each pair).

[] [22]
In each spar there should be a hole in which the shaft may run, and each spar should be firmly fixed in the ground so as not to move at all.

[] [23]
Then you introduce a round piece of wood, the shaft on which the rope is wound, into the two openings of the two wooden spars.

[] [24]
At one end of each shaft is a hole into which is firmly fixed a piece of wood a span long by which it is wound.

[] [25]
Likewise with the other two spars.

[] [26]
Then bind the wrapper that you have bound round his chest to the shaft at the patient's head, and those bound round his legs to the shaft at his feet.

[] [27]
Then have an assistant standing at each shaft to turn with his hand the handle by which the shaft is revolved, while the doctor straightens out the curvature in the way we have described.

[] [28]
This is the figure of the winch, the bench and the patient.

[] [29]
 After the spine has been restored and the place has been straightened it will be necessary for you to apply an absorbent plaster with egg-white, then packing, then over the plaster apply a flat splint about three fingers wide and long enough to cover the site of the curvature and several sound vertebrae on either side.

[] [30]
Then let it be bandaged as is needful and let the patient follow a mild diet until he is cured.

[] [31]
If after he is healed there still remains some prominence at the site, it will be necessary to employ remedies to relax and soften the parts, together with the use for a long time of the flat splint we described; in this case a leaden plate may be employed.

[] [32]
Sometimes there occurs a prominence at the end of the dorsal vertebrae, from which one may form the opinion that there is a dislocation, whereas it will be a superfluous bone that has become prominent; do not interfere with it by this treatment, for death may result.

Dislocations of the hip

 CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE.

[] [1]
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.

[16] []
And if the dislocation is outwards, it is not necessary to extend the patient downwards, nor raise them above the ground, but rather they should be as if the hip were dislocated outwards, as we have described for lying on both hips; and be on their face, and the strap extended as we have said previously, and one should press on the joint at the table; and it will be correct when the patient extends their legs, and they are even; then bring the thighs together, and apply the plaster, and secure it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and put the plaster on; and if you see that they are even, then tighten it, as before, and leave it for three days; then unbind it, and have them walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.

[] [30]
 If it is a posterior dislocation the patient must not be raised above the ground and extended downward; rather must he be placed upon something hard, in the manner that we prescribed for an external displacement of the hip: he is to lie prone on the bench with the bands tied as we said before.

[] [31]
It will also be necessary to apply pressure with the board to the site to which the joint has been displaced.

[] [32]
When the proper reduction of the joint is completed—the signs of reduction will be plain to you; namely, that you extend both the patient's legs, and when you see that both legs are of equal length and the patient can draw up and stretch out the leg without difficulty, then you may know that the limb has gone back as it should—then bring both thighs together, apply the plaster and bind with a sash so that the hip does not move in any direction; and the patient is to keep perfectly quiet for three or four days.

[] [33]
Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other.

[] [34]
If you see that they are both the same size you may know that the dislocation is cured and you can allow the patient to walk freely.

[] [35]
But if you see any slackening then repeat: replaster and rebandage as you did at first, and leave for another three days.

[] [36]
Then unfasten.

[] [37]
He should be cautious about walking on it for some days, until it is thoroughly strong, God willing.

 CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO.

[2] []
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend their leg to their thigh, and if it does not join to their thigh, know that it is dislocated; and the restoration of all is that you have the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and put your back against their face, and put their foot on your feet; then take their knee in your palms, and pull between your fingers, then bend both sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends their foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that they can easily bend their leg to their thigh; and apply the plaster, and have the leg bound to the thigh, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind it; and the patient should not exert themselves to walk, until the limb is strengthened.

[] [4]
The sign of dislocation is to bid the patient flex his leg on his thigh, and if it does not reach the thigh you may know the knee is dislocated.

[] [5]
The way of setting all the types of dislocation is to make the patient sit down with both legs extended, if he can, with an assistant sitting behind him to hold him by the middle and incline him slightly backward.

[] [6]
Then do you yourself sit on his thighs with your back to his front, and put his leg between yours; then the palms of your hands should be applied to his knee, and join them together by twining the fingers; then with the palms put strong pressure on both sides of his knee while another assistant extends his foot until the knee goes back to its place.

[] [7]
The sign of its return is that the leg can be flexed back easily and without hindrance upon the thigh.

[] [8]
Then apply a plaster and flex the leg on to the thigh and bandage them together for three or four days; then loosen them.

[] [9]
He should do little walking for some days until it gains strength.

 CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE.

[3] []
And when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient sit upright, and have an assistant hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle; then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left twice, then extend it upwards, and gently push the foot upwards; and do this twice, as we have said, pushing and pulling the foot; if it returns, that is good; if not, repeat the process, for it will return; and if it cannot be returned this way, have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly plant a stake in the ground between his thighs, and tie cloths around it, so that it does not injure the patient; then have the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a strap, which he ties above the instep; then each assistant extends evenly, and the stake remains between the patient's thighs to restrain the patient while he is being extended; then the physician evenly sets the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.

[] [5]
As to treatment when it is dislocated completely, you should make the patient sit upright with a strong and sturdy assistant holding him about the middle from behind.

[] [6]
Then hold the dorsum of the foot with your right hand, and with the left grasp the foot from below about the heel.

[] [7]
Then draw the foot toward you with your right hand, then with the left, twice.

[] [8]
Then extend it with the left hand and thrust the metatarsus with the right hand without violence toward the leg.

[] [9]
Do this as we have described, twice.

[] [10]
Then thrust the metatarsus toward the leg a third time while exerting traction at the heel.

[] [11]
If it goes back in one or two attempts thus, and you see the foot is straightened, well and good.

[] [12]
If not, repeat the operation and it will go back.

[] [13]
If you find it impossible to reduce it by what we have said, make the patient lie on his back on the ground and firmly fix in the ground between his thighs a stake wrapped in material so as not to hurt him.

[] [14]
Then an assistant should grasp his thigh and another assistant should extend the foot, either manually or with a cord tied round the narrow part of it; the assistants should pull one against another, with the stake upright between the patient's thighs holding him so that his body will not be dragged down with the extension.

[] [15]
Then the doctor should straighten out the dislocation with both hands, while another assistant holds down the sound leg; then the dislocation will speedily go back.

When a wound occurs with a dislocation, and one wants to treat it, it often happens that the patient dies: so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, unless you are wise in the art and have practiced it for a long time, and unless you are compassionate and merciful and cautious, not bold; and use at the beginning things that soothe hot swelling, and leave the patient in God's hand if you see no hope of recovery; and when you do see hope, then immediately return the limb to its place, before the hot swelling comes; and when the limb is in place, then administer things that soothe hot swelling, and treat the wound, as is appropriate, with drying ointments; and if there is a fracture with the dislocation, and small bones separated, then remove them, and do what we have said for simple ailments; and beware of acting out of fear, as I have said, for this is worth much to you according to your Creator, and for the safety of your soul and your body. 

[2] []
Amen

[] [3]
Therefore such treatment should be undertaken only by a person that is skilled in the art, has long experience, is dexterous, sympathetic, cautious, and not reckless or over-bold.

[] [4]
To begin with he should apply only remedies for the allaying of abscesses and then leave the patient to Divine providence, unless, of course, the injury is light enough to give some hope of his escaping death; in which case you should set out to reduce it at once before an abscess arise.

[] [5]
If the part goes back as you wish, employ the treatment for allaying abscesses and dress the wound with suitable desiccant ointments.

[] [6]
If it be a dislocation with a fracture and there occur splintered fragments in the bone, try to remove them, following therein the instructions relating to the simple diseases we have mentioned before in their place.

[] [7]
Use your utmost diligence; keep clear of entering upon a course with a dangerous outcome, as I have enjoined on you before.

[] [8]
For this will best ensure the continuance of your prestige and safeguard your good name, God willing.
