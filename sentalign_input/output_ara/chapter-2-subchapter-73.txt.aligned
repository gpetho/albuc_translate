On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids, Warts, and Red Pustules That Occur in Women's Genitals.	On the treatment of haemorrhoids and warts and red pustules arising in the female pudenda.	0.8699041
Hemorrhoids are the swelling of the openings of veins until much blood constantly flows from them. When hemorrhoids become chronic, they turn into warts. I have mentioned their types and signs in the classification, and we will mention them here.	Haemorrhoids are an inflation of the heads of the blood-vessels leading to abundant and constant bleeding. When haemorrhoids are chronic they turn into warts. I have already mentioned in their place the kinds of wart and their symptoms.	0.8815478
What can be treated and what cannot be treated. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep in the uterus and cannot be felt, cannot be treated with an iron instrument. Those that are at the mouth of the uterus and can be felt are the ones that can be treated.	Now here I shall say which kinds permit of treatment and which do not. I begin by stating that haemorrhoids and warts in the depths of the uterus that are not palpable are not able to be treated operatively. Those at the orifice that are palpable you can treat.	0.75024325
The woman should enter a cool room, then stretch the warts with forceps or a coarse cloth and cut them from their roots. Then, when the blood flows, sprinkle on them one of the styptic powders that stops bleeding without cauterization.	So you should get the woman into a cool place and then draw on the warts with forceps or catch hold with pieces of rough cloth, and cut them away from the roots. Then if that cause a flow of blood sprinkle with one or other of the powders that stop bleeding but are not corrosive, such as acacia or dragon's blood or olibanum or the like.	0.7212924
Such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, and the like. Then raise her legs against the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and the like. Then take barley flour and knead it with honey and vinegar.	Then if that cause a flow of blood sprinkle with one or other of the powders that stop bleeding but are not corrosive, such as acacia or dragon's blood or olibanum or the like. Then raise her legs up against the wall for a while and then bring them down into cold water. And if the haemorrhage persist for a long time make her sit in an infusion of sumac and pomegranate rind and oak-galls and the like. Then take barley flour and beat it up with honey and vinegar, and apply to the back a plaster made of this.	0.83559823
And apply it as a poultice on her back. If the bleeding stops, then good. Otherwise, apply cupping to the back and breasts without scarification. Then take cotton and soak it in the juice of purslane or the juice of plantain or the juice of blackberry branches with a decoction of gallnuts and apply it to the area.	And if the bleeding cease, good; but if not, apply to the loins and breasts cupping-vessels without scarifying. Then take wool and dip it in the juice of red cynomorium or plantain or wild eglantine, together with syrup of oak galls, and apply to the place.	0.7708417
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with the ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the tips of nettles, rough in appearance.  You should cut off what appears of it in the same way as I mentioned for warts, and treat it until it heals.	And when the swelling has subsided treat the place with ointment until it heals. Now red pustules resemble the heads of thyme, and are of rough appearance. All that appears on the surface should be cut away in the manner mentioned for treating warts; and dress the wounds until healed.	0.86127603
