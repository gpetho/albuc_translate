of the abscess of the testicles
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering resembling a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
and the treatment of this illness is almost as dangerous as the one before, and yet we will tell you the procedure for it, according to what the ancients did.
You must have the patient sit on a raised seat, then push the suspensory of the testicles down with your fingers, along with the vessels that are next to the penis, and have the assistant hold them, and stretch them firmly;
then cut with a wide, transverse cutting spatula near the vessels, until they are exposed, and then dissect on each side, as we have described in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;
then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the screw came, and tie it again at the other end;
then cut them in the middle straight, along the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted fluids;
then treat the wound like the others where you generate pus, unless some vessel falls that nourishes one of the testicles;
for no harm comes from this, and if a screw comes to all the vessels, then it is necessary to pull the testicles with all the vessels;
so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and they dry up and cannot be helped.
