On Cauterizing Earaches.	On cauterization of pain in the ears.	0.82169795
If an earache occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and all the other treatments that we mentioned in the Classification, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery iron called "the point," which is pictured here.	When the ear gets a pain from the cold and is treated with laxatives and other medicine as mentioned in its section and the pain nevertheless persists, heat the cautery termed 'punctate'.	0.8054596
Then, after heating it, cauterize with it around the entire ear, as you would circle it, or around both ears if the pain is in both. And keep the cautery a little away from the base of the ear after marking the spot with ink, and the cauterization should be about ten dots in each ear, or thereabouts.  Then treat the spots until they heal, God willing.	Then after it has been heated prick with it in a circle right round the ear, or around both if there is pain in both, after the place has been marked with ink; the cauterizations being a little away from the ear. Let the cauterization be of ten punctures or thereabouts round each. Then dress the places till healed.	0.9131267
