On Splinting Loose Teeth with Silver or Gold Wires.	On interlacing loose teeth with silver or gold wire.	0.92896056
If the front teeth become loose and shaky from a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything that is eaten for fear that they will fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not been successful.	When the front teeth are loosened by some blow or fall and the patient cannot bite upon what he is eating lest they fall out, and you have without avail treated them with styptic medicines, the technique in this case is to bind the teeth with gold or silver wire.	0.764102
The remedy is to tie them with a gold or silver wire, and gold is better because silver tarnishes and corrodes after a few days, while gold remains in its original state forever and is not affected by this. The wire should be of medium thinness and thickness, as much as fits between the teeth.	Gold is the better, for silver oxidizes and corrodes after some days, but gold remains for ever in its state and does not suffer this change. The wire should be moderate in thickness in accordance with the distance between the teeth.	0.8460303
The method of splinting is to take the wire and insert its bend between the two sound teeth, then weave the ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the sound tooth on the other side with the weaving.	The method is to take the wire and run it doubled between two sound teeth; then with the two ends of the wire you weave between the loose teeth, either one or several, until you bring your weaving to a sound tooth on the other side; then you repeat your weaving back to the side whence you began; tighten it gently and judiciously till they do not move at all.	0.7816999
Then you return the weave to the side you started from and pull gently and skillfully so that they do not move at all, and your tightening of the wire should be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip, then you cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors and gather them and twist them with pliers and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.	You should tie the wire at the root of the teeth lest it slip. Then with the scissors cut off the two ends of the wire remaining over, and bring them together and twist them with forceps and hide them between a sound tooth and a loose tooth so as to not injure the tongue; then for the future leave them thus bound.	0.7714728
So that it does not hurt the tongue, then you leave it tightened like this as long as it remains. If it becomes loose or breaks, you tighten it with another wire, so they enjoy it like this for a lifetime. And this is a picture of the teeth and the form of splinting in two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see:.	But if it comes undone or breaks, bind them with another wire; so may he have the use of them all his life. This is a figure of the teeth and the manner of interlacing two sound and two loose teeth, as you see.	0.7591919
And a single tooth or two may be returned to its place after falling out, and it is splinted as we described, and it remains. But this is done by a skilled and delicate craftsman. And he may carve a bone from the bones of cattle and make it like a tooth and place it in the place from which the tooth has gone.	After one or two teeth have fallen out they may be restored to their place and bound in as instructed, and become permanent. This can be done only by an expert and gentle practitioner. Sometimes a piece of ox-bone may be carved and made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the site where a tooth was lost, and fastened as we have said, and it will last and he will get long service from it.	0.8131895
