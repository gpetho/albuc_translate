On cutting the frenulum that occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.	On incising the ligament below the tongue which is an impediment to speech.	0.7755357
This frenulum that occurs under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has healed.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural and congenital; or it may be accidental, owing to scarring from an injury.	0.774071
The procedure for it is that you open the patient's mouth with his head in your lap and lift his tongue, then cut that sinewy frenulum transversely so that the tongue is released from its constraint. If there is some hardness and knotting in it, and that is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and incise it transversely until the frenulum is severed and the knots are loosened.	The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth, having his head in your lap, and lift his tongue; then cut that sinew-like ligament transversely till the tongue is freed from its hold. If it is hard and nodular, arising from scarring after an injury, catch it with a hook and slit it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots undone.	0.9030889
And beware that the incision not be deep in the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding occur. Then after the cutting he should rinse his mouth with rose water or with vinegar and cold water. Then place a wick of linen under the tongue, which the patient should hold every night.	Beware of making the incision deeply into the flesh, or you may cut an artery there and haemorrhage may occur. After the cutting, let him rinse with rose-water or vinegar and cold water. Then put under the tongue a pad of linen, which the patient must keep in position at night to prevent the adhesion from forming again.	0.89970815
This is so that it does not reattach. If bleeding occurs, place powdered vitriol on the area. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the area with a lenticular cautery suitable for that. Then treat him with the rest of the treatment until he recovers.	If there should be haemorrhage, put pounded vitriol on the place; and if bleeding still prevails burn the spot with a lenticular cautery of suitable size and treat in the usual way till healed.	0.748777
