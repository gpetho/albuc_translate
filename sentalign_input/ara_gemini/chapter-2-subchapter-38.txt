Chapter thirty-eight on the removal of thorns and what gets stuck in the throat other than that.
Often a bone, a fishbone, or something else gets stuck in the throat.
It is necessary to remove from it what is visible to the eye after pressing the tongue with the instrument in the sunlight so that what is in the throat becomes clear to you.
And what is not visible to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the patient vomit before his food is digested in his stomach.
Perhaps the stuck object will come out with the vomit.
Or the patient swallows a piece of turnip or the root of lettuce.
Or he swallows a morsel of dry bread.
Or you take a piece of soft sea sponge and tie it to a thread, then he swallows it.
When it reaches the location of the fishbone, pull the thread quickly.
Do this several times.
Often the fishbone or bone sticks to it and comes out.
If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this manner:
It should be slightly thicker than the sound, and at its end there is a curve that the patient inserts gently into his throat, while raising his head upwards.
And he should be careful not to touch his larynx, lest it cause him to cough.
And he pushes the bone or thorn with it, or the physician inserts it with his hand, and the patient's insertion of it is better because of his knowledge of the location of the embedded thing.
And he pushes downwards or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all of this according to what is possible for him until it comes out.
