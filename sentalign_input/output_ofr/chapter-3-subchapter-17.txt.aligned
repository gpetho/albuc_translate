of the fracture of the bones of the foot	On fracture of bones of the foot and of the toes.	0.6683264
At the ankle there is no fracture, but in the bones of the foot sometimes there is a fracture and in the toes a little, and there rarely occurs more than a simple fracture in several places.	The heel is never fractured; but the bones of the foot sometimes are. The toes too are rarely fractured; but mostly they get crushed.	0.72289574
And if there is a fracture in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, have the patient put his foot on the ground, as if he wanted to walk, and then immediately put your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their places;	If a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see the bones riding over one another, let the patient plant his foot flat on the ground as if walking. Then stand and put the sole of your foot on the prominent bones and with your foot put pressure upon them and level them to their proper place.	0.84840596
then put the plaster and padding on it, and place under the arch of the foot a small board with two flat ends, then tie it to the leg appropriately, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things that you need.	Then apply a bandage and some tow on top, and put under the inner part of the sole of the foot a small board with two flat heads. After you have wrapped them in material and so on, bind them tightly to the sole of the foot.	0.8272411
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether they are broken or dislocated.	When three days or four have passed, loosen the binding and you will find the bones in position; whether they have been fractured or dislocated, the operation is (the same,) as you see.	0.8417402
And if any of the toes are broken, set them as we have described for the fingers of the hand; then put on the broken toe a splint along the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board which I mentioned, and tie it appropriately;	If one of the toes be broken, reposition and straighten it in the way that I described for the fingers; then apply to the broken toe a splint of a length corresponding to the toe and a little wider than it. Then under the sole of the foot put the board that I have just described, and bandage it on firmly.	0.9140609
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, put on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and tie the board under the foot; and it should extend over the end of the board beyond the arch of the foot, so that it holds it well.	If the broken bones number two, three, or more, then apply over each toe a single splint measured to it, wrapped in soft material, and bind the board on the sole and let the flat portion of each of the two heads extend beyond the end of the sole of the foot, so that it may be held firmly.	0.82247907
And you must not forget the other things that I have mentioned for other fractures, from what we have said; and treat each incident as appropriate.	And you must not forget to pay attention to all those contingencies that we have mentioned to you in other fractures; meet each contingency with the means proper to it.	0.84033686
