Chapter Fifty-Three.
On Cauterizing Ingrown and Non-Ingrown Nails.
This ailment often occurs on the soles of the feet, and it is a rough thing that pains the man. Cauterization for it is done in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a potent liquid.
Cauterization by fire is done by heating a hollow iron, similar to an eagle's feather, made of iron, the size of which surrounds the nail on all sides, and having a thin edge. Then you place it hot on the nail, then turn your hand with the iron around the nail until the iron reaches the depth of the nail.
And you leave it for three days to fester with pus, then you dress it with crushed wild mallow with salt and leave the dressing on it overnight, for it will remove it from its roots. Then you treat the wound site with the flesh-generating ointment until it heals if the nails are not ingrown.
And it often occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet. You should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's feather, and place it on the nail or wart, then pour a small amount of potent liquid into the tube.
And hold your hand while turning it with a slight squeeze of your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail, and the potent liquid finds its way to sink to the base of the nail. The patient should endure the sting of the potent liquid for a short time.
Then leave it, for the nail will come off by its roots.  This is how you do it one by one until you have removed all of them from the body. Then, after they have been removed, treat their places with ointments that promote flesh growth.
