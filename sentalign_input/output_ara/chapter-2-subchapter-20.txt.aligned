If the eye protrudes in its entirety without causing any damage or impairment to vision, you should first reassure the patient.  Then bleed him from the cephalic vein, then place a cupping glass on the nape of the neck without scarification, and apply gentle suction.	When the whole eye is prominent and there is no reduction or impairment of vision, you should get the patient's bowels open.	0.5862967
Then, apply a poultice to the eye made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.  Then bandage the eye tightly over the poultice with many compresses.  The method for the compresses is to take many soft rags and fold each cloth into four layers, making many of them.	Then venesect him in the cephalic vein; then apply cupping vessels to his neck without scarification and draw off by gentle suction; then put to the eye a poultice made of acacia and aloes and olibanum and sarcocolla; then bandage the eye over the application with many pads. The way to make pads is to take a number of soft rags and fold each into four thicknesses. Prepare a good many.	0.8305826
Then place them one on top of the other as much as the eye requires, then tie them tightly with a strong cloth. Reapply the cupping glass with suction, without scarification. Then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.	Then put them one on top of the other as the eye requires; then bind on stiff bandages over these, tying them firmly. Repeat the cupping with suction and without scarification. Then take away the cupping vessel and leave the eye bandaged a day and a night.	0.9373261
If the bandage loosens during that time, it should be tightened again.  Then, after a day and a night, remove the bandage as we have said. If you see that the eye has returned to its place, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the application of the poultice, the compresses, the bandaging, and the cupping glass until it returns.	If the bandaging slackens during that time, it must be tied properly. Then remove the bandaging after a day and a night, as we have said. If you see that the eye has receded, good. Otherwise repeat the applications and pads and bandages and the cupping till it does recede.	0.8939423
