Many times a wart is born on the ends of the nose, and it is enlarged and increased in some days so that it is very noticeable.	There frequently spring from the end of the nose warts that grow and increase daily till they disfigure the man.	0.63972783
And therefore you must cut it at the beginning of its appearance and eradicate all of it. Then place on the site either a cautery or burning medicine which stays on the spot.	So you should cut them out when they first appear; totally eradicate them and apply to the place cauterization, either actual or by caustic.	0.7481997
But if its excision is delayed until it is enlarged, then consider if it is hardened, hard, of dark color, and little feeling, then do not touch it with iron because it is a cancerous abscess; because many times to those who cut this abscess great malice comes upon the one who had it.	But if excision of them has been overlooked till they have grown big, then examine, and if the growth is stone-like, hard, and pale in colour, and with little sensation, do not interfere with it with an instrument, for it is a cancerous tumour. For I have often seen people cut these tumours, and great affliction resulted to the sufferer.	0.84576637
And if the abscess is of a mild touch and not of dark color, and sometimes excision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the site with what dries and tightens until it is healed.	But if the tumour be soft to the touch, not pale coloured, and you see it can be wholly removed, then purge the patient, and cut it off him fearlessly, and treat the place with astringents and styptics till healed.	0.77257466
