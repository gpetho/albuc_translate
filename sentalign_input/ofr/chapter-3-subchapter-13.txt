of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the knuckles of the fingers, few fractures occur, and there is often only swelling.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, it is necessary that the patient sits cross-legged, and sits straight before him evenly; 
then he places his hand on your outstretched thigh, and the practitioner extends the broken bones, and sets them evenly, until they are well joined;
and applies the plaster and the padding, if no abscess develops, then applies a splint according to the size of the area;
and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inside around the hollow of the palm, make a ball of cloths, and instruct the patient to squeeze it against his fractured palm;
and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft leather, as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as needed.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must put a splint on top and another underneath in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then tie it all around the hand, and tighten the bond between the fingers.
And if the fracture occurs at a knuckle of the fingers, if it is the thumb, set it evenly, as needed;
and bind it with the palm, and if you see fit, put a small straight splint to raise the fracture, so it does not move;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index or one of the others, align it, and tie it with the healthy finger next to it;
or you tie them all together in one grip, which is better, or you put on a splint, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and in the treatment of a hot abscess, and help those it affects, as I have said.
