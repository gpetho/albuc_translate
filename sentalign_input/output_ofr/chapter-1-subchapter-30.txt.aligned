about the spleen	On cauterization of the spleen.	0.43896347
When you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have discussed in the sections on treatments, and it is not effective, then there are three types of cautery that are all good.	When you have treated disease of the spleen by the means that we have mentioned in the section and your treatment is ineffectual, there will be three ways of cauterization, each of which will be correct.	0.85219574
One of these methods is to make three or four cauteries, in a line along the length of the spleen, similar to the shape of the cautery for the liver that we discussed before;	One is to make three or four cauterizations in a row over the long axis of the spleen like the cauterization of the liver, a figure of which has been given above.	0.8027283
and do not press your hand hard during the cauterization, and have the patient lie on his back;	Do not put pressure on the cautery. Have the patient's body supine.	0.5988621
And another method of cauterization is to heat the cautery that has two prongs, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;	The second method is to heat the cautery provided with two prongs, described in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder.	0.7457478
and lift the skin that is next to the spleen, where the patient's ribs are on the left side, and the elevation with which you lift the skin should be lengthwise along the body, and the cauteries should be across the width of the body.	Lift up the skin over the spleen at the level of the patient's left elbow; and let the fold of skin lie across the patient's body so that the cauterizations will fall longitudinally.	0.7862609
Afterward, insert the two heated prongs until the skin is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four (marks).	Then push in the two prongs, well heated, till you have pierced the skin from side to side. Then take out the cautery; and there are four cauterizations.	0.73269445
And if you wish, cauterize with the three-pronged cautery.	Or if you prefer you can burn with the other cautery, of three prongs.	0.70437986
Treat it afterward when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other treatments mentioned before.	Then dress the site of cauterization after you have allowed pus to run therefrom for many days. This is more effective than any of the preceding treatments.	0.6903007
