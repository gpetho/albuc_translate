Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the types of dislocation that occur with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both together.
Whenever something like that happens and I wanted to treat and set it, it often resulted in death.
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except one who is skilled in the craft, long experienced, gentle, compassionate, deliberate, neither reckless nor bold, and he should use in the beginning only the medicines that soothe hot swellings, and surrender to the patient's condition. 
Except what you hope for safety from damage with the mildness of the illness, and you see in it some hope, then reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter before the hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns as you intended, then use the regimen that soothes hot swellings and treat the wound with what is appropriate for it from the drying ointments. If the dislocation is with a fracture and fragments appear in the bone that are loose, then extract them.
And follow in that what we mentioned in the simple diseases from what preceded in their places.
And strive your utmost and keep yourself from entering the path of danger, as I have previously advised you, for that is more preserving of your prestige and safer for your reputation, God willing.
