Chapter Ninety-Five on Phlebotomy	CHAPTER NINETY-FIVE. On venesection.	0.6452136
The veins that are customarily phlebotomized in the body are thirty veins, of which sixteen are in the head.	The blood-vessels in the body which it is customary to open are thirty(two) in number.	0.5914211
And in the leg and foot are three veins: one of them is the one under the hollow of the knee from the lateral side; and the second is the Saphenous, and its place is at the ankle from the medial side; and the Sciatic vein, and its place is at the heel from the lateral side.	There are also three veins in the leg and foot; one of these is the sciatic vein on the outer aspect; the second is the saphena situated near the heel on the inner aspect; and there is the external saphena situated near the heel on the outer aspect.	0.8680199
And in the other leg are three veins like it.	And there are three veins, counterparts to these, in the other leg.	0.85491407
As for the two veins that are behind the ears, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for chronic colds, migraine, ringworm, and chronic malignant head ulcers.	Venesection of the two veins behind the ears. Bleeding from both of these will give relief in cases of chronic catarrh, migraine and chronic foul pustules, and scabs of the head.	0.6538463
And their cutting and cauterization have been mentioned at the beginning of the book.	The incision and cauterization of these two vessels has been discussed earlier in the book.	0.6845763
As for the two arteries that are in the temples, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for chronic migraine, severe headache, constant ophthalmia, and the flow of acute humors pouring into the eyes.	The section of the two arteries in the temples gives relief for chronic migraine and severe headache and constant ophthalmia and the flow of acrid superfluities into the eyes.	0.717705
And their mention, cutting, and scraping have been mentioned at the beginning of the book.	They and their incision and extraction have been mentioned earlier in the book.	0.7871235
As for the phlebotomy of the forehead vein, its benefit after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic is for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, ulcers, and unsightly redness.	Venesection of the vein in the forehead is, after venesection of the cephalic, a relief to chronic diseases of the face such as pustules and scabs and erysipelas.	0.70637393
And the way to phlebotomize it is as I describe to you: the sick person strangles his neck with a turban until the vein appears, then you take the instrument called the Axe, and this is its picture:	Now I shall relate to you the method of cutting: you bind the patient's neck until the vessel stands out; then you take the instrument called the 'pickaxe'.	0.7404933
You place the projecting fork that is at the head of the axe on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar in its manner, and you let the blood flow to the extent that you desire, then you loosen the tourniquet of the sick person and tighten it until he recovers. And it may be opened with a wide lancet, except that it is not appropriate for the lancet to be sharp-tipped like other lancets, but rather be slightly wide-tipped, and you bleed it obliquely because the bone is near, so perhaps the lancet might break in it if it is thin.	The spike in the head of the instrument you place on the vessel itself and then strike with a comb or some similar thing; and let the blood flow to the extent you wish; then loosen the band round the neck and bandage the vein until healed. Sometimes it is opened with a broad scalpel; the scalpel, however, should not have a sharp point like other scalpels but should be a little broader at the tip, and the vein is cut obliquely, because the bone is close and the scalpel, if it is too fine, may be broken on it.	0.8940388
As for the two veins that are in the corners of the eyes, their benefit is for eye ailments like scabies, redness, eyelashes, and diseases of the face.	Venesection of the two lachrymal veins gives relief in diseases of the eyes such as granular conjunctiva and inflammation and pannus, and in diseases of the face.	0.61725676
And as for the way of bleeding them, it is that the sick person tightens his neck with a turban, then you bleed them while you are standing at his head, and let the bleeding be slightly obliquely lengthwise with a small, slightly wide lancet, for the place has no flesh, so if the lancet is thin-tipped, perhaps it might break.	Now this is the method of incising: the patient binds a sash round his throat, then you cut open both veins, standing in front of him. The incision should be oblique, slightly longitudinal, with a small, rather broad scalpel, for in this place there is no flesh; so if the knife have too narrow a point it may be broken on the bone.	0.6999348
Then you let out the blood you need and put cotton on them and tighten them for one night, then you loosen them.	Then let flow what blood you wish, put cotton wool on both, tie for one night, then loosen.	0.8202074
And as for bleeding the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fever and severe headache and for diseases of the face like the red erysipelas that occurs in the nose, especially if it is chronic.	Venesection of the vein of the nose helps in acute fevers, in violent headache, and in diseases of the face such as the red pustules that arise on the nose, especially if they are chronic.	0.7598041
And the way to bleed it is that the sick person tightens his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long lancet and insert it in the middle of the tip of the nose itself between the partitions of the nose straight, because the vein does not appear to the senses there, so the blood will come out immediately.	This is how you make the incision: the patient binds his neck and then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a long fine scalpel and stick it in the middle of the very lobule of the nose, perpendicularly in the nasal septum (for the vein is not obvious at that spot) and blood will immediately flow out.	0.7676176
And it is appropriate that you deepen your hand with the lancet a little and let out the blood you need, then bandage it for a night, for it will heal quickly.	You should advance the scalpel a little and cause the blood to flow as required; then bandage for one night, for it will quickly heal.	0.7626804
As for the two external jugular veins, the benefit of bleeding them is for shortness of breath, the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases that occur on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, scabies, malignant ulcers, and eating sores.	Venesection of the jugular veins helps tightness of breath and the early stage of elephantiasis, and the melancholic diseases arising on the surface of the skin, such as the black vitiligo and impetigo and malignant ulcers and cancrum oris.	0.64225143
As for the veins of the jaw, the benefit of bleeding them after bleeding the cephalic vein is that it benefits from thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, malignant ulcers, chapped lips, and malignant ulcers that are in the nose and around it.	The four veins of the lips: venesection of them is effective, second to section of the cephalic vein, for pustules on the mouth and rotting of the gums and malignant ulcers and fissures of the lips and for malignant ulcer in the nose and round about.	0.7010235
And the way of bleeding them is that you sit the sick person in front of you and tighten his neck with a turban, then you turn his lips and look at the two veins that you see, one on the right of the lip and the other on its left, and you distinguish them by their blackness, and that is also because around them are thin black veins, so you cut them with a severed cut.	The way to venesect is to seat the patient in front of you and bind a sash round his neck, then roll back his lips and look for the two veins, one of which you will see to the left and the other to the right; their dark colour will show them up against the lip and also the fact that round them are fine dark veins; so cut down upon both, dividing them.	0.8621814
If it is difficult for you and you do not know which they are, then aim to cut the largest and clearest of them, and likewise do with the two veins that are in the lower lip.	But if you are in doubt about the matter and are not sure what they are, set about incising the largest and most obvious. Do the same with the two veins in the upper lip.	0.774
As for the two veins that are under the tongue, the benefit of bleeding them after bleeding the cephalic vein is for the ulcers that are in the throat from disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth.	The two veins under the tongue: their venesection is, after section of the cephalic, of good effect in the quinsy arising in the throat from disease of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth.	0.8301705
And the way of bleeding them is that you sit the sick person between your hands facing the sun and lift his tongue and look under the tongue on one side for a vein and on the other side for a vein, and their color is blackish, so you bleed them and be careful not to go deep in cutting them, for beneath them are arteries, so perhaps bleeding might occur from those arteries.	The way to venesect them is to seat the patient before you in the sunlight and raise his tongue, and look, and you will see beneath the tongue one vein on each side, blackish in colour. Cut them; but be careful not to go too far in your incision, for beneath them lie arteries from which there may be haemorrhage.	0.8585823
As for the three veins that are bled in the elbow, they are the ones that are customarily bled in all people, and their bleeding is in two ways: either by piercing with a wide basil-shaped lancet or an olive-shaped one tending towards thinness, or by incising with a knife-shaped lancet, which is the scalpel [and this is its image].	The three veins that are opened in the elbow are the veins which universal custom has used for bloodletting. There are two ways of venesecting these: either by piercing with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel or a rather fine olivary; or by cutting with a knife-edged scalpel, the lancet whose figure follows.	0.7791418
Image of the wide basil-shaped lancet:	The broad myrtle-leaf scalpel.	0.4194554
It should be wide, as you see, so that it is suitable for opening the hollow, full, prominent, visible, thick veins that contain thick, turbid blood.	As you see, it should be broad so as to serve for opening hollow, full, outstanding, obvious and thick veins, and those containing turbid blood.	0.92842126
And this lancet is less wide and thinner at the tip, suitable for phlebotomizing thin veins that contain thin, choleric blood. And this is the image of the lancet:	This scalpel is less broad and finer-pointed. It is suitable for venesecting fine veins that contain thin jaundiced blood. The lancet.	0.79797745
This is the lancet that is suitable for incision, and there are wide and thin types of it, depending on the width and narrowness of the veins, and this may be inferred from others, and it is well known among artisans.	This is the lancet for making a slit. There are broad and narrow varieties of it according to the breadth or narrowness of the vein. This one indicates what the others are like; it is well known to surgeons.	0.8229419
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and neck, from what is next to the chest and abdomen.	The basilic vein, which is one of these three vessels, helps, when cut, by extracting blood from disorders below the throat and neck, in the parts neighbouring the chest and abdomen.	0.78328794
And the phlebotomist should be cautious when performing phlebotomy on it and be careful of it, for beneath it is an artery, and if he makes a mistake and increases the insertion of the lancet, he will cut that artery, causing bleeding, so therefore, its phlebotomy should not be with a piercing lancet, but rather by incision with the lancet.	When one venesects it one must be careful and wary of it, for beneath the vein is an artery, so that if one is inaccurate and sticks the scalpel in too far one will cut the artery and cause a haemorrhage; therefore venesection of it should not be done with a transfixing scalpel but should be an incision with the lancet.	0.800995
If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it should be avoided and another should be used, or some of its branches should be sought, or the arm's tendon should be phlebotomized in its place, for it is clear, and incise it with the lancet as we have said.	If the basilic vein is not clearly discernible, leave it and turn to another, or look for a branch of it; or venesect the brachial cord instead, for that is evident; incise it with the lancet as we have said.	0.83288944
If you want to phlebotomize it specifically, then it is necessary before tightening the arm to feel the place until you identify the location of the pulse, then mark it with ink, then tie the arm and incise the vein with an oblique incision with the lancet as we said, and make sure that the strike falls away from the location of the artery.	But if you wish to open the basilic vein itself you should, before you bandage the arm, palpate the place till the site of pulsation is found; then mark it with ink; then bind the arm and cut the vein obliquely with the lancet as we said, and take care that the stroke fall some way from the artery.	0.77666837
And when you see, when tightening the bandage, swelling in the place that you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.	If, when tying the bandage, you see a swelling in the place that you have marked with ink, that swelling is the inflation of the artery, so avoid it.	0.87639904
If you see the blood, at the time of phlebotomy, jumping as the urine of a child jumps, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the blood of the artery, so then immediately put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger, and if the blood stops, as it often does, then tie the arm and leave it.	And if, on section, you see the blood spurt out like a child's urine, and it is clear and red, then you may know that it is arterial blood; so then be quick and put your finger upon it for a long while; then remove your finger and if the bleeding stops, as it often will, then bind up the arm and leave it.	0.78401154
And warn the patient against neglecting it, and let it be on his neck, and let him not move it for days until he recovers.	Caution the patient against neglecting it; let him be careful and not move it for some days, until it heals.	0.8127219
If the blood does not stop and overcomes you, and you do not have medicine at your disposal, then sever the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract and the blood will stop.	But if the bleeding is not stayed but resists your treatment and you have no medicament there at the time, then cut the vessel through if you can see it; for the two ends will contract and the haemorrhage will stop.	0.80752325
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, and take one half and tighten it on the location of the vein tightly with a bandage and padding until the next day.	Or else take a pistachio nut shell and split it and take one half and bind it over the site of the haemorrhage with a pad and bandage until next day.	0.9311032
Then if the blood stops, and if not, then treat it with what was mentioned previously regarding placing the styptic powders.	The bleeding may stop; if not, then treat by those means mentioned previously, namely the application of styptic powders.	0.7859602
And stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases because of the smallness of the wound and the effectiveness of the bandage on the arm, so know this.	It is not difficult in most cases to stop the bleeding, because the wound is small and it is easy to bandage the arm. So get to know it.	0.7983772
As for the Akhal vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the top of the head and the lower part of the body because it is composed of a branch from the Basilic vein and a branch from the Cephalic vein, as we have said.	Venesection of the median vein results in drawing off blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; this being due to the fact, as we said, that it is composed of a branch of the cephalic and a branch of the basilic veins.	0.77556944
And the phlebotomist should be cautious when performing phlebotomy on it, because there is a nerve underneath it, and if he goes too deep with the lancet and hits the nerve, numbness will occur in it, which is difficult to heal, and it may not heal at all.	The venesector should be very careful in opening it because there is a nerve beneath; and if he takes the scalpel too deep and hits that nerve it will cause stupor, the healing of which will be difficult and perhaps even impossible.	0.7445258
This nerve is often perceptible to the touch. If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not apparent, then you should make your incision with the lancet lengthwise and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then incise the vein lengthwise.	Generally this nerve can be felt, but if in some persons it lies hidden and is slender and not discernible, then you should make your venesection an incision with the lancet and diligently avoid the nerve. If the vein lies between two nerves you should cut it longitudinally.	0.8955779
As for the Cephalic vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the head and is useful for eye diseases. It is recommended for this vein, especially, if you want to perform phlebotomy on it, to do it by puncturing with the olive-shaped lancet or the broad basil-shaped lancet because it is the safest of all veins, as there is no artery or nerve underneath it, except that you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and look for the soft spot.	The cephalic vein: section of it is effective in drawing blood from the head and in diseases of the eyes. Particularly in this vein you ought, if you wish to incise it, to make your incision by puncturing with the olivary or the broad myrtle-leaf scalpel, for this is the safest of all veins as there is neither artery nor nerve beneath. When you are cutting it you have only to avoid with the scalpel the head of the muscle and to look for the soft place.	0.82589805
It does not harm it if it is not hit on the first try to repeat the phlebotomy several times, except that it may swell in some people if it is not bled on the first try, but that swelling does not harm it at all.	It will not injure it, if at the first cut you miss the vein, to repeat the incision several times; except that in some people it will sometimes swell up if the section is not made at the first stroke; nevertheless that swelling will do him no harm.	0.7299963
As for the method of phlebotomy, its complications, and what should precede it in its preparation, the first thing you should know is that phlebotomy is either used to maintain health only or used in diseases. The one used to maintain and sustain health and to prevent the occurrence of diseases should be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Akhal, and the Basilic, and the phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear, and it should be done on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of daylight have passed.	The manner of venesection, the accidents that may supervene, and the necessary preliminaries for performing it properly. First you should know that venesection may be employed either for the preservation of health or in cases of disease. When used for the preservation and maintenance of health and for guarding against the occurrence of disease, the venesection should be in one of the three vessels at the elbow, cephalic, median, or basilic; and it must be performed at the beginning of spring when the signs of repletion appear. The venesection should be done on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of the day have passed.	0.8250904
As for the phlebotomy used in diseases, it has no specific time, but whenever the need and necessity for it arises, whether at night or day, at any hour and at any time.	On the other hand, venesection administered for diseases has no fixed hour but when need and necessity arise, either by night or by day, at any hour, in any season.	0.70554006
Children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, and the elderly who have passed sixty years of age should not be bled.	Children should not be venesected until their fourteenth year, nor should you venesect old men of over sixty years.	0.92291546
If someone intends to have phlebotomy for any reason, it is necessary to cleanse his intestines before phlebotomy with a mild enema if there is a lot of retained waste, so that excess putrid matter that harms the main organs is not drawn from the intestines to the veins during phlebotomy.	When anyone has decided to be bled, for whatever reason, first of all his bowels must be purged with a gentle enema if they contain much excrement, lest at the venesection putrid superfluities be drawn from the bowels into the veins, that might harm the chief parts of the body.	0.7983018
Do not bleed the bloated, the drunk, or the intoxicated until that condition has passed from them. Also, avoid phlebotomy immediately after fever, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and anything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental.	No one suffering from indigestion or surfeit or drunkenness should be venesected until recovered from these; nor a dropsical patient. Beware also of venesection after stomach-trouble or vomiting or diarrhoea or much intercourse or fatigue or exercise or sleeplessness or fasting and anything else that diminishes the strength both bodily and spiritual.	0.7925639
Then consider thinning the humors before that if the blood is thick, with foods, drinks, and medicines, if possible.	Then, beforehand, see to the refining of the humours, if the blood be thick, by means of food and drink and medicines, if that is practicable for him.	0.835243
Then he should enter the bath if there is no impediment preventing him, or he should engage in some exercise so that the blood thins. And make his phlebotomy in the middle of the day, as we have said. He should aim to clear his mind that day of all bad psychological symptoms such as worries, anger, and fear, and of all physical symptoms such as excessive fatigue and exhaustion, intercourse, and so on.	Then, if there is no contra-indication, let him enter the bath; or let him take a little exercise to make the blood thin. Then perform the venesection in the early part of the day, as we have said. Let him endeavour on that day to have his mind free from all such evil spiritual affections as anxiety, anger, or fear; and from all bodily affections such as excessive fatigue and weariness and intercourse and the like.	0.8850455
And have present in his company things that people are accustomed to using, such as various perfumes, fragrant herbs, entertainment, and so on, each person according to what they can afford.	There should also be in the place where he is sitting such things as are customary for men to enjoy, such as various perfumes, aromatics, and music, and the like, as each one may.	0.7672674
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion that is higher than the cushion on which the person being bled sits.	Then the venesector should sit on a cushion raised above the cushion of him whose vein is to be opened.	0.64128596
Then he extends his arm, and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then tightens the bandage with the cord and twists it two or three times. The tightening should be moderate because if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening, it will prevent the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it will also prevent the flow of blood.	Then let him stretch out his arm, and let the venesector chafe it two or three times with his hand; then he should bind a bandage round it by means of thongs twisted two or three times. The ligature should be moderately tight, for any other sort of ligature, be it too tight or too loose, will hinder the flow of blood.	0.8260502
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be firm and take his time in all these matters.	Wherefore it behoves the venesector to be firm and deliberate in all these cases.	0.6774485
Then he lowers the lancet. If it opens the vein on that attempt, then fine, otherwise, he should try again a little below that spot or above it quickly if the area has not swollen.	Then he should apply the knife and if the vein is opened first time, good; but if not, let him repeat a little lower down or a little above, quickly, if the place does not swell.	0.8390945
If it swells or the patient becomes distressed, leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, as it may cause a hot swelling. And he should not enter the bath.	If it does swell or the patient be anxious, then leave him for a day or two and do not bandage, for that might perhaps provoke an abscess; nor let him go to the bath.	0.9187374
Then he can resume phlebotomy if he wishes.	Then if he likes, let the venesection be repeated.	0.6523106
If a large swelling occurs at the site of phlebotomy, which often happens, especially for those who have only been bled that one time or if the opening of the vein was small, then quickly place a sponge dipped in slightly warmed water and salt on the swelling and tighten it for an hour, and it will dissolve.	If there occur a big tumour at the site of venesection, as often happens, especially with a man who has not previously undergone venesection or if the opening in the vein be small, then quickly apply to the place a sponge soaked in lukewarm salt and water and bandage it for a while, then it will go down.	0.74876434
You should do this after the blood has completely come out from the vein itself or from another vein.	You should do this after the blood has gone out altogether from the same vessel or from another one.	0.93339187
If something of blackness or greenness remains in the area after a few days, it does not harm. If you wish, apply something of dissolved aloe and myrrh, or some extract of fudenj and the like.	If there remain after some days some discoloration or greenness at the site it will not hurt; if you like, apply some solution of myrrh and aloes, or juice of penny-royal or something similar.	0.85770905
Swelling and a bump often occur during the phlebotomy of the basilic vein, so place your hand on it, and if you find it softens when you press it, then it is a bad bump, so be careful not to put anything on it that we have mentioned because it might bleed arterial blood. But bandage it with something astringent to make the area firm, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.	Often in section of the basilic vein there occurs tumour and swelling. Put your hand upon it, and if you find that it sinks when pressed then it is a harmful swelling; be careful not to apply to it any of the things we have told you; for often arterial blood comes from it. But apply a poultice with some styptic qualities, to harden the place; then treat in the usual way until healed.	0.8353499
It is necessary to extract blood from every person according to his strength and what appears of the dominant color of the blood. For, if the blood is black, let it out until it turns red, and similarly, if you see it thick, let it out until it thins, and likewise, if it is sharp until its sharpness is gone.	Now in each case you should extract blood in proportion to the person's strength and to the prevailing colour of the blood. If the blood be black, let it flow until it becomes red; in the same way, if you see it is thick, let it run until it is thin; and again, if it be sharp, until its sharpness is gone.	0.90437925
It is necessary for whoever is full-bodied and strong and needs to remove blood all at once to widen the phlebotomy of the vein and let the lancet be wide. And whoever is weak, then the opposite of that. It is best to extract it in rounds and to have the hole narrow.	In the case that is plethoric, robust, and requiring venesection just the once, the incision should be wide and the knife should be broad. And on the contrary for the debilitated person, in whose case you should venesect several times and the opening should be small.	0.6645839
The best way to perform phlebotomy is obliquely, angled and with an incision, not a stab.	The best method in venesecting is if the incision be at an angle, oblique, cutting, not piercing.	0.6878405
This type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve, and it is better and safer than horizontal or vertical phlebotomy.	This manner of venesecting is safe from haemorrhage and from cutting the nerve; it is better and safer than cutting straight across or straight along.	0.79607594
Whoever usually faints during phlebotomy, it is necessary to feed him before the phlebotomy some bread soaked in sour pomegranate juice or oxymel if he is hot-tempered, and let his blood out in three or four rounds. If he has a cold temperament, he should take before the phlebotomy bread soaked in a drink of water-mint or in honey drink sweetened with spices or in basil-flavored drink.	To the patient who habitually faints during venesection you should give to eat beforehand a little bread macerated in the juice of unripe pomegranates or oxymel, if he be of a warm temperament; and draw off the blood in three or four instalments. And if he be of a cold temperament let him take beforehand bread macerated in syrup of quinces or in aromatic syrup of honey or in fragrant syrup of basil.	0.8793182
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy, and its cause is the loss of a large amount of blood, he should be given meat broth and a thin basil drink. He should use rose water perfume and have his chest gargled with it, and all other things we have mentioned in the section on fainting caused by bloodletting.	If the patient faints during venesection and the cause is great loss of blood, then be should be given to drink meat-juice and thin syrup of basil; and he should perfume himself with galia moschata and anoint his chest with it. And for the rest, use what we have spoken of in its place in the chapter dealing with fainting due to evacuation.	0.8140274
As for whoever wants to relax his arm and let his blood flow again, it is necessary for someone whose phlebotomy was for excessive bloodletting and whose strength is weak, to release blood little by little, according to his strength, on consecutive days.	As for him who wishes to ease his arm and draw off blood a second time, when he is undergoing the venesection on account of great evacuation and the lowness of his strength, you should let the blood slowly, in proportion to his strength, on successive days.	0.81940603
As for whoever wants to relax his arm and let his blood flow again, and whose body is strong, let him do so seven or nine hours after his first phlebotomy.	For him who wishes to ease his arm and draw off blood a second time, being of robust body, it must be done seven or nine hours from the first venesection.	0.84656173
As for whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it has flowed, he should be treated on the second or third day.	He who wishes to draw blood from his body to the side opposite to that toward which it tends, should be eased on the second or third day.	0.93241346
As for whoever has a lot of blood in his body that has become hot and acute and has caused fever, it is necessary to remove the blood from him all at once and take out a large amount of it and widen the opening until fainting occurs, after having examined all the conditions of phlebotomy, and to place your hand on his pulse when the blood is flowing so that death does not occur instead of fainting. This happens often if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.	He who has abundant blood that has become hot and sharp and has produced fever should be bled at one time, and a large amount should be taken with a wide opening, until he faints (all the rules of venesection having been observed by you); but you should keep your finger on the pulse while the blood flows lest death take the place of fainting, for that often happens when the venesector is ignorant and there is carelessness. If you wish to loosen the arm and let blood a second time and you find that the opening of the vein is now closed up and the outflow of blood is difficult, you should not press hard upon it nor twist the arm violently, for that is very harmful.	0.80714536
It is not necessary, if you want to loosen the arm and release the blood again, and the mouth of the vein has closed and the blood flow is difficult, to press on it hard or twist with force because that is very bad. Rather, either leave it until you perform phlebotomy again, or remove with the blade of the lancet what has clotted from the blood at the mouth of the vein, or apply to it some salt that has been dissolved in water, or apply some theriac or scammony, and press gently until the blood comes out.	If you wish to loosen the arm and let blood a second time and you find that the opening of the vein is now closed up and the outflow of blood is difficult, you should not press hard upon it nor twist the arm violently, for that is very harmful. Either you must leave him a while and then bleed him again; or the clot of blood can be removed from the opening of the vein by using the blade of the scalpel, or by applying some salt dissolved in water; or apply some of the great theriac or shakhzanaya; and put light pressure upon it until the blood comes out.	0.90465
If the vein is swollen, leave it alone and do not touch it until the swelling subsides.	But if the vein has begun to swell, leave it and do not touch it until the swelling has subsided.	0.8127216
If there is a need to release blood again, it is unavoidable; then either bleed him above that area, or bleed him in the other arm or in the other vein.	And if you are unavoidably called to let blood again, venesect either above the place or in the other arm or another vessel.	0.80719167
As for phlebotomy of the median cubital vein, it is phlebotomized as a substitute for the median and the basilic veins if they are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of the two.	Section of the cord of the arm: this is cut in place of the median and basilic veins when these are not to be found or are hidden; for this vein is composed of those two.	0.68493426
The method of its phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm becomes red and the vein appears clearly, then you tie it above it with the bandage slightly, moderately tight, then you phlebotomize the vein obliquely, a little, not horizontally or vertically, and let the opening be wide and let your phlebotomy be a little above the wrist joint.	The way to venesect it is for the patient to dip his hand in hot water until the forearm is red from the warmth and the vessel stands out distinctly. Then bandage a little above it with a moderate pressure, and then cut the vein a little obliquely, neither transversely nor longitudinally. The incision should be broad, and you should make the cut a little above the wrist.	0.8099062
If blood flow is difficult, put the hand back into the container with hot water and let the blood flow into the water until your need is met. If you are in the summer days, you might not need to put the hand back into the water. Mostly, flowing of the blood into hot water is practiced during winter.	If the blood does not flow easily, have the hand again put into the vessel of hot water and let the blood flow into the water until you have extracted what is needed. If it be in the summer time you may be able to dispense with putting the hand back into the hot water; it is mainly in winter that you let the blood flow into hot water.	0.9251293
Phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.	Venesection of this vessel is safer than all others for beneath it there is neither artery nor nerve.	0.79977477
As for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments, and the method of its phlebotomy is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells and becomes very clear to the touch, then you phlebotomize it slightly obliquely, and even if you cut it completely, it will not harm it at all. Be careful not to go deep with your lancet because the nerve of the fingers is beneath it and the area is devoid of flesh.	Section of the salvatella of the right hand is efficacious in case of diseases of the liver. The method of venesecting it is to tie a band round the wrist or grip it with your hand, after you have put it in hot water until the vein is swollen up and is plainly to be felt; then cut it somewhat obliquely; if you cut it right through that will not matter at all. But be careful not to go too far with the knife, for underneath there are the tendons of the fingers and the place is bare of flesh.	0.7763945
Then put the hand back into the hot water and let the blood flow in it. If you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will clot at the mouth of the vein and stop flowing. Once you have removed the required amount of blood, put some fat and salt on the vein so that it does not heal quickly. The same applies to every narrow branch.	Then put the hand again into hot water and let the blood flow; for if you do not put it into hot water again the blood will clot in the opening and will be prevented from flowing. When you have extracted the required quantity of blood, put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not heal too quickly. You should act thus with every narrow branch.	0.9111359
As for the benefit of phlebotomizing it from the left hand, it is beneficial for spleen ailments, and similarly you do in its phlebotomy as you did with the second one, the same way.	Incision of the salvatella of the left hand is of value in diseases of the spleen. Venesection of it should be carried out in the same manner as you did in the other.	0.63913584
As for the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower body such as uterine ailments, menstrual retention, kidney diseases, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.	Venesection of the saphena is beneficial in diseases of the lower part of the body, such as afflictions of the uterus and retention of the menses, and for diseases of the kidneys, and for chronic ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar diseases.	0.7992901
The method of its phlebotomy is to put his leg in hot water and massage it until the veins flow, then tie it above the ankle joint. The vein is located at the heel, visible towards the big toe, and it branches out into many branches on the leg. So, phlebotomize it at its widest branch, or at the heel at its confluence. This is best and safest.	Now the manner of venesection is for the patient to put his foot in hot water, then friction should be applied to it until the veins fill up; then bind a thong over the joint of the foot; then the site of the vein at the ankle is shown up running toward the big toe and forming many branches on the surface of the foot. Then make your incision either in the broadest branch or at the ankle before it ramifies, for that is better and safer.	0.80963343
If you phlebotomize it on the surface of the leg, be careful of the nerves underneath on the surface of the leg, and make your phlebotomy oblique, as if you intend to cut it, and the lancet should be sharp.	If you venesect it on the surface of the foot, be careful of the tendons that are beneath on the surface of the foot. Make the incision obliquely as though you were cutting the vein through. The knife should be a lancet.	0.77800715
If the blood flow is difficult, let him put his leg back in the hot water and leave the blood to flow until it drains.	If the flow of blood be impeded, put the foot back again into hot water and let the blood flow out into it until it is evacuated.	0.9005084
If the phlebotomist misses the vein with the phlebotomy in the first round, let him repeat the phlebotomy slightly above it, for the area is safe and there is no fear of a problem if you are careful of the nerve as we said. And similarly you do with the saphenous vein of the other leg in the same way.	If the venesector makes a mistake the first time in the vein to be cut, let him repeat the section a little higher up, for the.place is safe; you need fear no mischief as long as you are careful of the tendons, as we said before. In the same way you may deal with the saphena of the other foot.	0.8061412
As for the sciatic vein, its place as we said is at the heel of the lateral side, and the benefit of its phlebotomy is for hip pain if it is due to hot blood. The method of its phlebotomy is to have the patient enter the bath quickly and tie his leg from the hip to four fingers above the heel with a thin, long bandage, because it does not appear otherwise.	Now the position of the sciatic vein is, as we said, on the outside near the heel. Section of it is effective in pain in the hip when it arises from hot blood. The way to venesect it is to make the patient get into the bath. Then hasten and bandage his leg from the hip to a distance of four fingers above the heel, with a long narrow bandage; for only this will cause it to appear.	0.7742788
When it appears, phlebotomize it in any case you can, either obliquely, which is better, or sever it completely or make an incision, because its place is safe.	When it has appeared then open it in whatever way you can; at an angle, which is best, or right through, or only cut it open, for it is a safe place.	0.7633833
It is very hidden in most people. If you do not find it and it does not appear to the touch at all, phlebotomize some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot towards the little and ring fingers. Beware of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood you want, then loosen the bandage and put cotton on the place of phlebotomy and bandage the area, for it heals quickly.	But in many people it is very hard to find; and if you do not find it or it is in no way palpable, then venesect one of its branches, which will be seen on the surface of the foot towards the fourth toe and the little toe. Be careful of the tendons, and let the amount of blood you require. Then loosen the bandage and apply cotton wool to the site of the section and bandage the place; it will heal quickly.	0.7735802
