Chapter Seventy-Two
On the Treatment of Imperforate Anus
Imperforate anus is when the woman's vulva is not perforated or the opening is small. This can either be congenital, something she is born with, or accidental. The accidental type occurs due to a preceding cause, and it results from excess, protruding flesh.
Or a thin or thick membrane, and it may be in the depths of the uterus, or in its sides, or in its top or bottom.  It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and sometimes it prevents menstruation.  Knowledge of it is through examination by the midwife.
If the obstruction is apparent and near, (treat it). If it is not apparent, then examine it with your fingers or with a probe. If the obstruction is of a thin membrane and it is near the labia, then immediately perforate it. That is, you should place something like supports on the labia, then place both of your thumbs.
With the woman on her back and her legs spread apart, then stretch the labia forcefully until the thin membrane ruptures and the obstruction opens. Then take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area. Have the woman engage in intercourse every day so that the area does not rejoin.
If the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel resembling an ace of spades. If the obstruction is from protruding flesh, grasp it with hooks and cut it. You should have with you medications that stop bleeding without stinging, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly; keep it in for several days.  Use a wick of dry linen. Then treat it with other wound-healing treatments until it is cured.  Another fleshy growth may occur in the uterus; it should be cut in this same manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, for a cancerous tumor that occurs in the uterus should never be touched with an iron instrument.
