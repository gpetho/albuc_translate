of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins which habitually bleed, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become bluish; and we have already spoken in the division about their nature, and the symptoms, and I will speak here of those that can be treated.	Haemorrhoids are an inflation of the heads of the blood-vessels leading to abundant and constant bleeding. When haemorrhoids are chronic they turn into warts. I have already mentioned in their place the kinds of wart and their symptoms. Now here I shall say which kinds permit of treatment and which do not.	0.75812674
I say that for hemorrhoids and bluish swellings, when they are deep in the anus and they cannot be felt, the treatment is not with iron.	I begin by stating that haemorrhoids and warts in the depths of the uterus that are not palpable are not able to be treated operatively.	0.7120873
Those that are at the opening of the anus, that can be felt, are those that can be treated.	Those at the orifice that are palpable you can treat.	0.7139175
And if it stops, that's good.	And if the bleeding cease, good; but if not, apply to the loins and breasts cupping-vessels without scarifying.	0.4182573
If not, have cupping glasses applied to her back and breasts without incisions; then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or in holly juice with old wine, and apply it warm to the area.	Then take wool and dip it in the juice of red cynomorium or plantain or wild eglantine, together with syrup of oak galls, and apply to the place. And when the swelling has subsided treat the place with ointment until it heals.	0.60693806
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed; and the one that is called "albathir" is red, and looks like a rough head, you must cut it like I said for the swelling; and then treat it until it is healed.	And when the swelling has subsided treat the place with ointment until it heals. Now red pustules resemble the heads of thyme, and are of rough appearance. All that appears on the surface should be cut away in the manner mentioned for treating warts; and dress the wounds until healed.	0.7388897
