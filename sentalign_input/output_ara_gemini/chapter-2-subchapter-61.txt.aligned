Stones rarely form in women.	It is very uncommon for women to have stone.	0.8087654
If one of them develops a stone, its treatment is difficult and prevented for many reasons.	But if it should happen to a woman the treatment is indeed difficult and is hindered by a number of things.	0.6426736
One of them is that the woman may be a virgin.	One is that the woman may be a virgin.	0.9498159
The second is that you will not find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a physician if she is chaste or has close male relatives.	Another is that you will not find a woman who will expose herself to a (male) doctor if she be chaste or married.	0.75698316
The third is that you will not find a woman who is skilled in this craft, especially working with the hand.	A third is that you will not find a woman competent in this art, particularly not in surgery.	0.8424183
The fourth is that the location of the incision for the stone in women is far from the location of the stone, so it requires a deep incision, and in that is danger.	Then a fourth is that the place for cutting upon the stone in a woman is a long way from where the stone lies, so the incision has to be deep, which is dangerous.	0.88160646
If necessity calls for it, then it is best to find a skilled female physician.	If necessity compels you to this kind of case, you should take with you a competent woman doctor.	0.77187353
And they are rarely found. If you cannot find one, then seek a chaste and gentle male physician, or bring a skilled midwife in women's matters, or a woman who has some knowledge of this craft, and have her do all that you instruct her to do, starting with examining the stone.	As these are very uncommon, if you are without one then seek a eunuch doctor as a colleague, or bring a midwife experienced in women's ailments or a woman to whom you may give some instruction in this art. Have her with you and bid her do all that you enjoin; first of all, in searching for the stone.	0.82304406
That is, she should see if the woman is a virgin, then she should insert her finger into her rectum and search for the stone. If she finds it and presses it under her finger, then you should instruct her to make an incision over it.	If she perceive that the woman is a virgin she should pass her finger into the anus and palpate for the stone. If she finds it and keeps her finger on it, then bid her cut down upon it.	0.8444156
If she is not a virgin but is a widow, then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.	But if the patient be not a virgin bid the midwife pass her finger into the vulva and palpate for the stone, after she has placed her left hand upon the bladder and applied a good pressure.	0.83091503
If she finds it, she should move it from the opening of the bladder downwards as far as she can until she reaches the base of the thigh, then make an incision over it opposite the middle of the vulva at the base of the thigh, from whichever side she can reach it and feel the stone in that area, with her finger not moving from the stone, pressing it underneath.	If she finds the stone she should gradually push it down from the outlet of the bladder as far as she can until it reaches the bottom of the pelvis. Then she should cut down upon it from about the middle of the pudenda near the root of the hip on whichever side she can conveniently feel it; she must keep her finger on the stone, pressing from below.	0.87461287
The incision should be small at first, then insert the probe into that small incision. If she feels the stone, then she should increase the incision to the extent that she knows the stone will come out of it.	The incision should start by being small; then let her introduce a sound into the small incision, and when she finds the stone then she will enlarge the incision until she knows that it is big enough for the exit of the stone.	0.87468946
Know that the types of stones are many, including small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and branched. Know their types to be guided by that to what you want.	You should know that there are many kinds of calculus: some are large and some are small; smooth and rough; long, rounded, and pronged. Learn to recognize these types and you will have an indication of what to do.	0.801679
If the bleeding overcomes you, sprinkle crushed vitriol on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work until you remove the stone.	If you are hindered by a haemorrhage, scatter powdered vitriol on the place and keep it there for a time until the haemorrhage has ceased, and then return to your operating until the stone is out.	0.8988726
Make sure you prepare for yourself the instruments that I mentioned for removing stones in men, to help you in your work.	See also that you have ready the instruments mentioned for the extraction of stone from the male, to assist you in operating.	0.82082856
If the bleeding overcomes you and you know from the pulse of the blood that it is from a severed artery, then place a cautery on the area and tighten it with bandages tightly, and leave it and do not return to it, and leave the stone and do not remove it, as the patient may die. Then treat the wound. When the intensity of the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area putrefies, return to your work to remove the stone.	If you are hindered by a haemorrhage and you know, by the spurting of the blood, that it comes from an artery that has been cut, then put styptic powder on the place and bind up tightly with bandages and leave it and do not come back to it; let the stone be and do not extract it, for often that loses the patient; then dress the wound. And after some days, when the acute haemorrhage has subsided and suppuration has set in, return to your operating until you get the stone out.	0.8858638
