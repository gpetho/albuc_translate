The twelfth chapter on the reduction of a fracture of the arm.	CHAPTER TWELVE. On setting a fracture of the forearm.	0.67062575
The arm is composed of two bones called the two ulnas, one of which is small, and it is the one next to the thumb, and the other is large, and it is located below the small one from the bottom; so perhaps the larger ulna may be broken alone or the small one alone, and perhaps both may be broken together.	The forearm consists of two bones and is sometimes called 'the two firesticks'. One of these bones is small and is in line with the thumb, the other is large; this is the one placed lower, under the smaller one. The larger alone may be broken, or the smaller alone, or both broken together.	0.8945237
So when the small upper ulna is broken, its repair is easy and its healing is faster, and when the lower ulna is broken, its breakage is bad and its healing is difficult, and the worst of it is if the two bones break together.	When the small upper bone (radius) is broken it is easy to set and its mending is rapid. When the lower bone (ulna) breaks it is bad and its mending is difficult. Worst of all is when both bones break together.	0.8371954
So, if the bone that is broken is the small upper ulna, then the physician should, when repairing it, make its extension slight gently until he straightens it; and if the large ulna is the one that is broken, then he should make its extension stronger; and if both ulnas are the ones that are broken, then he should make the extension much stronger.	If the broken bone is the radius, the doctor when setting it must use light traction, gently, until he has it straight. If it is the ulna that breaks, he must employ stronger traction on it. If both bones break he must employ very strong traction. During setting and extension the hand must be disposed on a cushion, spread out with the thumb uppermost, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger downmost, while the patient sits cross-legged upon the floor.	0.74578035
And if there are splinters in the bone fracture, then you try to return each splinter to its place with your best effort. If a loose splinter appears in it and it is piercing the skin, and you have no hope of repairing it, then incise upon it and extract it in the manner we mentioned previously.	If there be any splinters in the fracture he must do his utmost to restore each splinter to its place. If a detached splinter appears there and is piercing the skin and you have no hope of restoring it, cut down upon it and remove it in the manner we have mentioned earlier.	0.90775096
And if the fracture is with a wound, then I have devoted a chapter to it, so you take the treatment for that from there.	If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, we have devoted a separate section to this, so take the treatment of it from there.	0.84604824
And if a hot swelling occurs at the beginning of your repair, then smear a cloth with the cerate made with rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thick and thin, and tie the cloth on it with a gentle tie until the swelling subsides, then remove the cerate and apply the poultice prepared from mill dust with egg white, then apply the splints, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be slightly wider and stronger.	If, when you begin to set the bone, an effusion occurs, smear a cloth with the wax made from oil of roses and white wax, of medium thickness, and bind the dressing on gently. When the effusion subsides, remove the wax and apply the plaster prepared from mill-dust and egg-white, then apply splints; the splint that goes on the actual fracture should be a little wider and stronger than the rest.	0.86392075
And know that the number of arm splints is six in most cases, whether the fracture is in one ulna or in both ulnas together.	You should know that the number of splints for an arm is, as a rule, six, whether the fracture be of one bone or of both together.	0.8293334
Then make your tightening on the site of the fracture stronger and tighter, and whenever you turn the tightening upwards or downwards, make the tightening slightly looser, as mentioned previously at the beginning of the chapter.	Then bandage more tightly and strongly over the site of the fracture, and, as you wrap the bandage above and below the fracture, bind little by little more loosely according to the instruction given at the beginning of the book.	0.8147967
And let the cloths that are wrapped on the fracture be soft and moist cloths, and let them not be very hard, and let the thread that is tied with it be specifically linen, medium between thin and thick, as we described.	The dressings wound round the fracture should be gentle and soft, not very hard, while the cord for binding is best made of linen of medium thickness as we have prescribed.	0.715021
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days, and if something happens that needs to be corrected, such as an itch occurring in the limb, then it is necessary to wash the limb with warm water until the itch subsides, and leave the limb untied for a night until it rests, then resume tightening.	Some days later, examine the limb and the bandaging and if anything has happened that should be put right, such as pruritus in the limb, the limb should be bathed in warm water until the pruritus has subsided. Let the limb be unbandaged for one night so that he may rest, then put the bandage on again.	0.8869709
And if the tightening has loosened and the bone has shifted or something like that, then repair all of that with your best effort.	If the bandaging has become loose and the bone has shifted or anything of that sort, correct it all diligently.	0.83519375
And look also, and if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, then you should loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until the nourishment flows to it, then tighten it.	Look also to see if nourishment is being prevented from reaching the part on account of over-bandaging, in which case you will have to loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it; then bind it up.	0.801044
And if nothing of what we mentioned happens to the patient, then it should not be loosened until after twenty days or so.	But if none of those things that we have mentioned happens to the patient, it should not be loosened until after about twenty days.	0.943323
Then hang the patient's hand from his neck, and let his arm be straight, and let him diligently avoid turbulent movements, and let his sleep be on his back.	Then the patient's hand is to be suspended from his neck, the arm being level, and he should guard carefully against agitated movements, and should sleep on his back.	0.89015055
And know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days, all of that according to the states of the temperaments and the states of strength.	You should know that this fracture of the arm mends in thirty or thirty-two days, and sometimes in twenty-eight, depending on the individual's constitution and the condition of his strength.	0.8277267
