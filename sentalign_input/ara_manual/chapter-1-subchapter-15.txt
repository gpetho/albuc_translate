Chapter Fifteen.
On Cauterizing Relaxation of the Eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize a little above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, and keep away from the temples, and the length of each cauterization should be along the length of the eyebrow.
And do not overdo the cauterization, but only to the extent that a third of the skin is burned, and the shape of the cautery iron should be of this form.
