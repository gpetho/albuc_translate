Chapter Twelve.
On lifting hair irritating the eye with a needle.
If there is a hair or two, the procedure is to take a thin needle and thread it with a smooth, thin silk thread. Then, bring the two ends together and tie them in a very delicate knot. The length of the thread should be about a span.
Then, attach to the loop another thinner thread, shorter in length, and tie its ends if you wish. Then, have the patient place their head in your lap, close to the sun so that the work is clear, as it is delicate work. Then, insert the needle with the loop at the root of the extra hair.
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair. Then, pull the thread over the loop and insert the extra hair(s) into the loop, whether one, two, or three, no more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid, along with the natural hairs. If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, pull the loop down with the thread that you attached to it until the loop comes out of the upper hole.
Then replace the hair in it and pull them both. Do this until it rises in the upper hole and you can see it clearly. Then, release the loop and thread and remove them. Tighten the eye and leave it tightened for two or three days until the hair takes hold in its place and the flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, you can either add a long natural hair to it so it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a while, at which point you can lift it.
