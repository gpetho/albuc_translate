Oh sons, I have fully presented to you this book, which is the culmination of my science of medicine, for its completion and fulfillment in life, and for the explanations and declarations it contains, I believe that you will be able to grasp its essence within this treatise, which is part of the art of surgery.
How the operation of surgery is exposed in our region and time, mostly private, whereas it is fraught with great risk due to the science of it, and its history is still unexplored; only a few small descriptions are left in the ancient books, which have modified them, added new ones, and corrected some errors and shortcomings that occurred among their clauses, thereby clarifying their understandings, making progress with force and art.
And it seems to me that you will bring back to life that ancient order of this treatise on the second path of explanation and declaration and abbreviation; and for its forms of tools such as cauterization instruments and other works in the art be added through declaration, and preparation for them, which is necessary.
The text means: "But the reason why it is not easily found by any skilled artisan in these times is that the art of medicine is long, and so their actor does not know how to exercise themselves in the science of anatomy which Gualia knew before, who learned about the youth of limbs and their forms, and the connection and separation of them; and he has knowledge of bones, nerves, and sinews, and the number of them, and the excretion of them; and of pulsating veins and quiet ones, and of the places of their injection.
The text means: "And from this it is said that Hippocrates has a name, but in the work little, and most of all in the art of medicine.
The text means: "But we have already said about him in the introduction of this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable about it does not understand what we have said about anatomy, and therefore will fall into an error from which men die, as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science and throw themselves from that knowledge and their experiments.
The text means: "That I have seen a doctor old and foolish who inserted an apsema scrophelous in the neck of a woman, and cut some arteries of the neck so that she had great bleeding before the woman died among the others.
There is another doctor who treated a man with an ulcer in his state, and the ulcer was very big, and came to him and extracted that ulcer along with some of its surroundings, because that man died on the third day.
I had asked to extract it, and I saw that due to the size of the ulcer and the disposition of the disease, I would surely have been killed.
I saw another doctor who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and went to a blacksmith who was giving him an arrow that had caused a fracture in his cavity; and because of his ignorance, he extracted the fracture on the wound with pulvins and stakes with strong tension, without releasing its life breath.
And placed him according to his desires, and wrapped him, and commanded that we release the ligaments; and thus until the cavity and foot were closed, and he perished.
I was called to him, and I wrapped him up to release the ligament, and succeeded in restoring his calmness and alleviating his pains.
May corruption was already confirmed in the member, so that it could not be restrained, and did not cease to roam through the member until the disease was at its peak.
And we saw another doctor who perforated an abscess that was cancerous, and it became ulcerated after six days, to the point where the disease of the lord within it grew greatly.
The cause is that the cancerous growth is pure of melancholic humors, so it does not penetrate with iron to everything, but rather is contained in the member which has suffered from such a condition.
And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation be divided into two parts: one in which it is associated with health, and the other in which there is risk in the major dispositions.
And I have existed in this entire location of this book where victory is over operation in which there is error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to guard this and hold it fast, so that the people do not come to speak and accuse you of dishonesty.
Take up your arms in supplication and protection of God, and your illnesses with humility and firmness.
And use the better path through God's grace to find salvation and glorious success, and lay your terrible illnesses with difficult cure, behind you that our arms from this may make you fear, so that in your faith and in your name do not flee: for much more is left to your glory, and then in the world and in the rest of your sanctity.
But surely you will not be deceived in some of these messages. Do not heal false sickness, lest you become known as one who heals nothing.
And now I see that this book is divided into three chapters.
Commencing the division of the book, and first of the first section. The first chapter, ordered in the order of the feet, in the forms and instruments of cautery and from there what is necessary for operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on dryness and perforation, and on vesicles, and on boils, and on plagues, and on the extraction of arrows and similar things to those, all explained and arranged according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and the cure of a twisted limb and similar things to those; a chapter arranged from head to foot, and according to the forms of the instruments.
Explain the quality of the cautery and its needles, and in what circumstances it is prohibited.
And thus it is said that the discourse on the quality of the cautery's needles and its implementation is a long and prolix one, subtle in knowledge, and secret hidden away; for many wise men have spoken about this, and there are also disagreements among them, and as for me, I can only recall a small part of their discourses, which seem to be overly verbose.
It seems to be saying that the cautery will relieve all types of conditions related to matter, except for two types: spinal conditions.
In the spinal condition and dry matter, it dries out; because some say that applying cautery is beneficial to that one, and others disagree with it, that applying cautery is not suitable in diseases of quality and dryness, because the nature of the fire is quality and dryness, and so the disease of the spine and dry matter should be cured by drying out and cooling.
But those who say the opposite, for applying cautery is done only in all spinal and dry diseases that occur in men's bodies, because when you compare the man's body to the fire's humidity, it surpasses the man's body with cold.
And I say this according to the word of that one, because it has already been experimented on me in some cases for discovery.
But however I do not think that will come true what has already been exploited and exercised in the capital of cautery for further practice, and because one is aware of the diversity of the human body and the disposition of diseases in their inner parts, and the causes of those, and the accidents they occur in, and the space of time those take.
In other cases, it's not about fear, and more often in painful and humid illnesses, where all the doctors agree on them, and do not err with the cautery on the young patient.
It is wise, children, that the secret of healing through cautery with fire and the goodness of it are more in cautery on medicine that burns, because the fire is simple, the action of which does not reach but to the limb which is cauterized, and does not bother the other limbs adjacent to it by a little damage.
But the action of medicine that burns reaches to the limb where it has not yet, and therefore makes it come to the ill member with a difficult healing and a strong hindrance.
But the fire, by its sublimity and substance of goodness, does not do this but rather overflows; for it is already known to us through experiment and long years of study on the art above the truth of the causes; and therefore I excuse myself from the length of speech, and if it were not that it is not proper to speak freely in this pause, I would reveal to you my secret hidden in the fire, and the quality of its operation in the body, with the demonstration shown philosophically, which would be sharpened for your sufferings.
You should know, sons, that these differ from each other in time as to when it is convenient to perform cautery and pause at the best time for spring.
I say that cautery is convenient at all times, so that the damage caused by accidents may be submerged in the early stage of this procedure, and more so if it is for painful or necessary pains, strong and urgent, which do not suffer delay, because they are feared by those who come with malicious intent, which is greater than minor injury entering through time.
So this is not for your health, or sons, because this only measures the common people and foolish doctors, therefore, after a sickness that is cured by cautery is not always correct and pause those consequences.
And the cause is not just because they can feel it, for cautery is only in place of medicine that alters the complexity and dries out the humidity, which are causes of pain.
But nevertheless, cautery is unnecessary over medicine by the whim of its value and virtue of its operation and size of its master.
It is possible that her illness may return in some hour of the day, depending on the complexity of the illness and the location of her illness, as well as its nature, and this that is prepared in her body with the addition of superfluous things to it, and which has been introduced to her in its acquisition through food and similarities to those causes; but if the illness where cauterization is applied is a subtle illness in some few parts of the superfluousness and humidity, then it may not return that pain, but rather this is done in small points.
And it is more common to say that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, and it's a very serious matter, not because of what I understand in this case, but because they believe that it's not cure that benefits with medicine or another cause, but rather cauterization.
And the cause is actually in opposition to what I understand; and I think that what is considered the last resort of medicine is only when administering various remedies for certain illnesses, and those medicines don't confer success, and therefore at the end of the case, one administers cauterization, and benefits from it. And from now on, it is customary to use cauterization as the last resort of medicine, not according to my understanding of the way in which common and foolish doctors understand.
They said that cauterization from the sun is better than cauterization from fire, and it was not said so because of the equality of gold and its subtlety of substance.
They said that the location of cauterization does not matter, because it is not entirely true, since you have already proven and proved that it does not work on the upper body, but only on other parts of the body, and cauterizing those areas is better than using fire; however, when you do cauterization with fire from gold, it is not for your declaration, because it depends on the amount you want to apply according to the roar of the gold, and in preparing to receive heat; and if you place yourself on the ignition, the gold burns by the fire, and in case some strips are placed in the fire so that the artisan can touch them with his occupation.
And from this, it is done cauterization with fire because it should be made gently and more urgently in the right direction of operation.
I have no idea what it means.
The first principle.
This cautery confers to the coldness and moisture an additional cause of the accident from which it results, which has two causes, one being the soda and many other types of traumatic flux, called corissa, running from the head to the parts of the feet and ears, and many sleepings, and toothaches, and foot pain, and a general malady that comes through coldness, in such a way as paralytic fever, soda, and apoplexy, resembling those diseases.
The form of this cautery is as follows: first and foremost, it commands the sick person to evacuate themselves with laxative medicine, cleaning their head, for three or four nights, according to the virtue of the sickness and the age and condition of the patient and his custom.
And it commands him to shave his head with a razor, and to cut that serpentine shape between your fingers on a charred board, and place your hands over the earth of his feet.
Place your hand over the root of your palm near the bones under the nose between your two humps. But since the place you mentioned is already infected, mark that place with the olive wood cautery, which is this form:
Place it on that spot which is infected, in such a way that you press down, slowly, so that your hand may be constricted little by little, and you turn it around.
Lift your hand slightly and look at the spot, and if you see already that some bone has been uncovered a certain quantity of it, as much as the quantity of grains of sand, then elevate your hand, and if not, turn your hand with another one, until the bone is visible like I have told you.
Take some salt and dissolve it on the spot, and let it sit there for three days.
Place over it the spot where it is beginning to form, on the border and let it sit there until the scar of the fire is destroyed. Cure the area by applying a four-part remedy within it until healing occurs.
And they said that just as the plague brings up an eruption, so too do gout and fever bring on the arm, making it better and more effective.
They said that the tendon should be cauterized into the bone, and the cautery kept in place until it is dried without causing any crack or split in the particular part of the bone.
And let it dry so that it is strengthened by the bone, and let it be cured.
They said that the cautery should penetrate to the deeper part, into what is pressed against the bone so strongly in the bone's weight until the bone hardens, and this is the form of applying plasters. They estimate that from that location will expire the vapors of the head.
And it is kept to allow the eruption of the plague for long periods, and then it is cured before consolidation.
But as for these two kinds of cauteries, I do not see them in practice among men but rather through fear; and the thin one, it is necessary to me, because it is better for him than salt, when his head is deviated due to solution of continuity from that place as we have testified in other members, especially when the head of the sick person has a free nature.
The special type of cautery I first use is more safe and better for you; and from that, I have made and done this work, and it has saved your life.
In second place.
From the cautery of the head.
When chronic pain occurs in the entire head and it is prolonged in the ulcer, using a combination of herbs, poultices, capillaries, emplasters, guaiazulens, caldels, gualinas and semblantz, and mainly if it has already been cauterized with one that does not relieve any of those causes, then he considers whether the head of the ulcer is of strong formation in its nature; and if it's not a big fuss, then he uses another cautery on it just a little. And he cauterizes him over the corn of his head with a cautery inside where the tendon is split. The tendon is cut open and the bone is exposed to the quantity that we have counted, and he cauterizes him with a cautery at the back of the head in the place called "vas", - which is that place where the windy pipe is placed. And alleviate your hand in that way, and do not search for the bones, because the malady through this is met with a great pain different from all other cauterizations of the head.
I will perform this cauterization in its place, because it is known that the cauterization with which they are treating the corns of the head and the occiput is more subtle than that to which the middle part of the head is subjected; and this is how it is done.
And all was well.
Of the cauterization of emigrated new bone.
When the pain of the head begins, or is spread out inside the skull, either evacuation with medicine that soothes the head is done, and the other cure is administered, which I have said in the sections on diseases; and if it does not profit, then there are two ways of cauterization: either cauterization with sharp medicine that burns, or with iron.
But the cauterization with burning medicine is that you take a sweet made of alum, and scrape off those areas from both sides of it. And appropriate points are made on the location of the pain in the temple with a sharp lance inserted through it so that there is a marked point hidden from view, covered by the code.
And apply strong medicine on it stopped up by constriction, and ease it over the space of three hours; and release and treat the limb, and place the wound in bed, submerged in water so that the area becomes soft.
And cure it by applying an ointment until it is healed.
If you wish, do this with some medicines that I have written down in the book of medicinal properties.
May the cautery be done with this method: fires for the purpose of cauterization from which this is the form:
And it is called a claw, because its head is like the shape of a cross in the form of a curve, and at the midpoint of it there is a small prominence.
And place your hand on the location of the pain, and hold tight to it -- so that the bow is not injured which is left there -- and turn the small iron piece by little by little with speed.
If the quantity of the person that is required for the specialty of the cord ( likely referring to a medical instrument or tool) exceeds the size of the body, and you raise your hand so that the artery is not exposed, which is left open, so that no flow of the sanct occurs.
And apply a poultice in water and salt on the area, and place that there for three days; and apply a poultice mullet to the border, and cure with ointment until it is healed.
If you see, cauterize the extremity of the cutlery according to the cautery, and guard yourself from the wound of the artery in this manner, not ancient.
Chapter Four.
On the cauterization of ancient arteries.
When you cure an artery with water that is as said of the previous healing, and as said in the divisions of diseases, and do not exploit the healing, and sometimes when the disease does not reach to it what has been said of the first cauterization by medicine or by the cauterizing fire, then observe closely so that you insert the cutlery cauter into until it is whitened, so that you signify over the place of pain on the line of length from which is the greatest part of the said, or what; and put your hand for one side and stretch that in order to strike the artery and proceed into the bone.
It seems that the patient has a swollen jaw. The tongue is enlarged due to excessive chewing, and there may be inflammation of the skin and nerves around the jaw. A spasm cannot be ruled out, which can cause discomfort or pain.
If it is about the custody and caution of the flow of sanguis from an artery that is obscure, which causes fear at its beginning, and more so to one who ignores this and does not take note of what he does, and neglects study; then let the operation be performed in him at the start.
And I found in my memory the regimen of managing flows of sanguis that occur due to an arrow wound according to its own method, in the same place as this book.
And if you see that this illness does not require such a cautery and sees the body of the sick person tolerable, then cautery him at the middle part of the head just as we have recounted, and cure the wound until it is healed.
And if you see, administer the cautery which we have spoken of in the chapter on the treatment of arrow wounds with two cauters, and it is more beneficial to perform this cautery than another.
The beginning of the treatise.
Remedies for shoulder pain.
When in the shoulder there is pain due to cold and it is cured by means of laxative causes and another remedy which I have explained in the division, and the pain does not subside, then apply heat to the cauterization, for it is this which has no point, from which this comes:
And place points in the heat, and it be carried to the entire surface of the shoulder, like a wheel is rolled around, or in the circle of each joint if the pain is in any one. Apply the cauterization of the shoulder joint little by little, as you have felt the pain is located.
If the cauterization of ten points is placed all over the shoulder, and as those, apply cure to the inside where they are healing.
Chapter six.
Remedies for a sprain.
A sprain which is cured with cauterization is only of the species that flow through phlegm, as has been said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoids cauterization of the type used for drying or nerve spasm.
When you treat that type of burn with scar tissue, skin lesions and ulcers, but do not apply your treatment, then cover the patient with three cauterizations: the first is the razor's edge of the ear, and second a small amount from his temple, and third is the connection of two labias.
Pause the treatment for three days in the opposite direction of the patient's sickness, because softening appears only in the beginning that heals.
The form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cauteri in the third part of the extremity of the ear, above the small over the corn of the head, and in the temple, another lengthwise, whose length is according to the length of the said foot, and then place your hand on the cauteri until the quantity of the middle of the specified type of cord is burned.
And this is the form of the cauteri, and it is a special type of cutlass, whose shape is like an anvil. The text means: However, there is subtlety in that it is a little easier to see when one has been cut recently; and it is clear where the wound is because of excessive swelling.
The text means: Let's treat the area where it is located, in front of the process that occurs inside, until healing.
The text does not seem to be a translation, but rather appears to be a title or chapter heading. Without more context, it's difficult to provide a meaningful translation.
The text means: On the cautery of old stroke or cerebral hemorrhage.
The text means: When an apoplexy is old and you cure that area with the treatment we have discussed, but do not rely on your own medicine, and the patient does not have fever, then cauterize it with four cauterizations: over all of his hair on his head; and cauterized at each ear, as has been said; and also in the nostril. The text means: And the way of the cautery is done as has been said before.
The text means: And it is also cauterized over the mouth of the stomach; and it is later, and let treatment proceed.
The opening of the gouty passageway.
To perform a cautery for oblivion due to weakness.
That are given to the patient at the beginning, large pills and medicine for the belly.
And let his head be completely shaved, and place on the cough of him at the center described in the treatise of plastering.
And pause that one occasionally, because that is a manner of cautery. And it will be done according to the order of those doctors which I have said.
And therefore if those remedies bring him health, and not, then let him do to him three cauteries in the lower part of his head, which are coming down from the higher part of the head into the lowermost part of the neck. And pause between each cautery the swelling of the said part, and place on it the cautery as it has proceeded.
But if you add to it and the illness is here tolerant, then let him have cauteries in the middle place; and if you see greater addition, then cauterize that on both toes.
Preserve the cure within that person who is to be healed; and use olive oil cauterization in the form as given.
Cap 9.
On the cautery for parasites and mollification of the entire body.
In case you need to apply mollification to the head with jars and as they have said; and cut off the head of the sick person, and apply olive oil cauterization at the middle location of the head, and cauterize over all the warts on the head, and cauterize over the lower part of it, and make three cauterizations over the spine of the neck.
But if the illness requires mollification of the whole body due to tropics and the patient's tolerance is low, and the illness is severe, then cut off four cauterizations over the spine of the back, and apply olive oil cauterization inside so that it may be burnt by the cord of his neck, and raise his hand. Preserve the cure within that person who is to be healed, and this shall be olive oil cautery.
Capital book of medicine, chapter 1.
On the cautery for epilepsy.
It is not cauterized in epilepsy, but rather that epilepsy is caused by inflammation.
And therefore, it is recommended to purify the brain of the patient at the beginning of their illness, and with another cure which we have discussed in the division when the disease is great, and except for the exception of medications.
And if it is an infant who does not respond to medicines, then administer galenics and medicinal herbs, which are served to the patient over a period of days, with a nourishing diet.
And place a bandage on the head of the patient, and apply cautery to that area in the middle of the forehead, according to the previous manner, and another cautery on the occipital region of the head, and over each temple. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then apply cautery to those areas that I have mentioned, which are paralyzed and softened by inflammation of the spine and vertebrae.
Cauterize with olive oil according to what was previously prescribed.
But if the illness is in a child, then pause on subtle cautery according to this manner.
Chapter 11.
On the cautering of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors, wet and flaccid flesh, then cauterize that area with cautery which has been said to be paralyzed.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excessive decline to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then have him drink water that clarifies his brain according to what has been previously stated in the division.
And place the patient's head down, and place a thin, curved blade made of suitable material on him over the circle, and then deposit it in the middle of the head.
And have the patient sit upright, and be held securely from head to foot.
And place a pause of oil; and it is more worthy of being used on old wool. A person on fire should be covered in hot food to warm them up before measuring, who says so when it is mid-day. Take that person to the middle of the head in a circle and let them be massaged.
Let this be the patient's food for the whole week one meal, and let the other medicine be applied inside until they are cured; or if you prefer, apply cauterization by making small points according to his weight; unless you have the hand of a skilled person with an appropriate cauterizing instrument: this is a type of cauterization that moistens the brain with equality.
Place that food in a little vessel on a border or in grayish stones of guailina.
Capítulo twelve (Chapter 12).
About the cauterization with water that falls down on the heel.
When you have declared the beginning of water on the heel by the signs that I told you in division, then start and give to drink to the patient that makes his head clear, and keep it away from all humidity.
He applied a poultice in bandages on an ulcers.
And he orders him to shave his head, and cauterize the corresponding area with a cautery in the middle of the head; and he cauterizes two areas with two cauteries over the temples if it is the beginning of an ulcer of water on two wounds, or on one side if it is the beginning of an ulcer on one wound.
Cut all the veins and arteries that are exposed to the cold, and they are the cauteries in that length along the line of the temples.
Watch for the flow of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see blood flows out of him or any medicine stops it, which is to your possibility.
You will find the wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and with the removal of those, and caution about the flow of blood.
And some times it is cauterized in the neck, behind two bones with two cauteries directly applied to produce it.
The text states that gout is a disease caused by cold humors that infiltrate the body, leading to pain in the feet.
On the cauterization of old tears.
When tears from the spleen become old and are found in the veins and arteries located in the area of the head, and it is observed that this leads to excessive bleeding of the skin, then cauterize those wounds with a pointed instrument which we have mentioned earlier as being applied to the beginning of an eye injury, and one cauterization on the middle part of the head, and two cauterizations in the neck, near these two temples, and also two cauterizations in the neck, near these two bones. If you wish to add a vein, then cauterize it from the entire length of the spleen's tail over the ear's extremity on the forehead with a small pointed instrument.
The text is incomplete, but based on the chapter title, it seems to be related to treatments for various ailments or conditions mentioned earlier in the treatise.
On the cauterization of nose odor.
When you treat that water which they have said in the division and it has not benefited your treatment, then give the patient a dish of vinegar to drink for three nights; and place a cloth over his head, and cauterize him with the pointed instrument olive-sized and with another olive-sized. Make points on the surface of the foot with a pointed cautery, and place two points on each eyebrow, using the hair as a reference, one on each side.
Be careful not to burn that area.
This is how you do the pointed cautery on this area.
Chapter XV.
On cautering for softening eyelashes of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with one cautery on top of it; and this is how you do it:
If you wish to cauterize it above the eyebrows a little with two cauteries on both sides of the face. Be the length of each cautery according to the amount of eyebrow hair.
Do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery, but rather according to the amount that the treated part of the eyelid is adhered.
The 16th chapter of a medieval medical treatise.
Cauterizing of eyelashes of the toe when the skin is converted to divided parts and finger the toe.
When the skin of the toe is converted to divided parts and it causes pain on the toe, cut the toe in two ways: either by applying heat or by applying medicine that burns.
If you apply heat to the toe, command the sick person before that to read his own skin as it is, with those parts which they clean up, until they are prolonged and swollen; and if he puts on that foot, then take off his nail, always tying his toes of him with a bandage so that they do not break through when his skin is born.
Then, when they are swollen and inflamed, put your head on the sick person's shoulder, and place a strap over the eyelashes of his toes, with a signal which should be according to the shape of an oak leaf, and placed near the skin.
And place a poultice in front on the heel, either with albumen of owl or with mucus of thistle on the toe.
Then place the cautery of which this is the form.
Then cauterize on the figure which you have marked, in small pieces, scattered, until the surface of the cord is burned, appearing like a myrtle leaf, entirely.
If the safety of your work is that you see the eyelid of the foot contracted and its nails elevated due to the puncture of the foot.
Then elevate your hand and lay it on that spot for three days, and place your pause over it at the border until the scar is healed. Then treat that area with ointment until healing occurs.
But if it returns through the hairs for any cause, and the eyelid becomes soft, then do another cautery over that exactly as you did originally.
But if the hairs are in the eyelid as well, then cauterize that there until it is elevated to its natural place and closed, so that the hairs do not pierce the foot.
The translation is: "But the cautery is medicina comburent to this, so that you command the patient to look into his bowels until they are prolonged and enwrapped, and let be done of a cloth of doctor's paper in the shape of a leaf of myrrh.
The translation is: "And take some saffron known and cause living yolk and one, or whatever you do there, mix those causes well, and make a festination so that it's not inflamed; and expand this over the paper which is made like a leaf of myrrh, and place it on both heel and the foot; and let put the heels cut in a vial of honey, and the head of the patient be in your hand.
The translation is: "And put the one to your mouth and do not swallow it until the patient feels the biting of the medicine, as if there was fire.
The translation is: "And therefore, when you feel that the other biting has ceased, then read the medicine and put it in your mouth; therefore, when the biting ceases, then wash the foot with water; and therefore consider if the eyelid is lifted as if it has been washed due to the constriction by fire or incision, for it is so. And if not, return over that of the medicine on the spot where it was not applied until you have finished your operation and are closed the foot.
Put your hand over the spot where it borders the edge so that the chain of the adjustment is eradicated, and cure it with the ear dropping into or in another place where healing occurs.
It is necessary for you to perform your operation with diligent vigilance so that in the heel it does not fall under the medicine, and if the eyelids are put aside for a few days, and there is no cause for the pain in the heel, then iterate your medicine over that place where the eyelids are softened, and thus you will do what was done at the beginning, and turn around again so that it heals.
This is the way of mirtroot leaf.
You know that the heels of men are diverse in size and shape, and therefore according to this, your contraction is done.
And it should not be hidden the way of rectification to that which is studied in this art.
Chapter XVII.
On the cauterization of a fistula that is in the tear duct of the foot.
When you cure a fistula and have stated what was said in the divisions of illnesses and do not trust your cure, then often be cautious that you cauterize that according to this manner: Command the patient to put his head on your shoulder, and keep his head with some minister between your hands in such a way that it is not bruised nor agitated on his head.
And place a poultice of hot fat in an albumen of wood or in mucilage of hair on the heel of him.
And take the cautery of which this is the form:
which is of the same kind as a cane or a rope twisted into the form of an arrow, from one end to which the cautery is made.
If you wish, penetrate into the other extremity. And if you want it to come out in the same way as a splinter.
But still, one who is concave is better for your work.
To open the fistula if it is opened, carefully draw out the sickness and remove excess moisture from that place. If it is not opened, then open it and extract the pus from that place.
Place your hand over the pus with the cautery that is well ignited, and touch it to the tip of the nose, so that you don't touch your own hand or cause the patient's illness to worsen, then pause the cautery on the gray areas of the foot and corrupt those.
Therefore, if the beginning of your cautery pierces into the bone, it is good; otherwise, pause the cautery every now and then or two, if necessary; let it rest for three days, and place a poultice soaked in hot oil over that spot until it heals.
But if after ten days it is not healing, then pause over the sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is cut as seems fitting in its own capital.
Another method for cauterizing a fistula which some people claimed was effective: place the finger in the location of the fistula and feel that, and then pause in that subtle fissure, so that it is the shape of it: there is one ounce of molten lead; and your hand will be held firmly with good retention, and not be evil for the illness so that the molten lead does not reach the foot of that person; and it is covered that you pause over the foot of the illness, cut into alum of honey or water, where the lead adheres to the location of the fistula and heals it by wonderful cure.
If the fistula is healed as we have said about the cauterization and treatment, then it is good; if not, then it is necessary to administer some treatment through the nose and reduce the fistula to the nose according to its proper place.
The fistula should be directed towards the nostrils, so that it may discharge into them, rather than returning again to the body through the nose, as is often the case.
On the treatment of cuts caused by splinters.
Small injuries can cause fissures in the lips, and especially in children's lips.
Then if you treat those fissures as we have said in the divisions and do not further intensify your treatment, then sometimes apply a small pointed cautery, following this shape that is stitched.
And the cavity should be made in proportion to the subtlety of the spoon.
Then place a pause or cushion in those fissures while the cautery proceeds to the root of the fissure.
And treat that too under the same condition, as soon as it is healed.
The first line translates to:
Treatment of a fistula in the mouth.
When an ulcer develops on the uvula or on the palate or in the folds of the teeth, and you apply pressure and break it open, and if it becomes old and rotten, and you cut it again, and you create a fistula, then cure that one too, and do not waste your treatment, for how much you know of cauterizing according to the amount received in the fistula, put that igniting material into the track of the fistula, and with your hand inserted so that the iron may penetrate to the root of it, and at the end make it a wound or two; then cure that too as we have told you for the treatment before it is healed.
And therefore if the healing is torn apart and it heals, then yes; but if not, then it is necessary to discover the location and heal the corrupted bone according to what comes in its head.
Head.
Treatment of the teeth by cauterization and softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are sharp, then cure that one with medicines and do not trust them, unless you pause the head of the sick person on your shoulder, and apply the cauterizing instrument in the form which comes to apply so, in such a way that you pass it through the gap over the tooth, entering it with the burning cauterization fervently, and let your hand go in slightly so that the sick person feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
Place your hand over it, and place the cautery in some way according to what you wish.
And lift the patient up, and place them on water with salt in their mouth for an hour, so that the swollen tongue may stop, because the mouth is closed, the gum is softened, and the moisture corrupted is dried out.
Chapter XXI.
On the cautery treatment of toothache pain.
When toothache is caused by coldness, or if there is frost or ice on it, you do not apply treatment with medicine, but instead apply cautery in two manners: either with cow dung at the border or with fire.
Cautery with cow dung means that you take cow dung, boil it in iron pots, place the boiled cow dung on your finger, and place it over the tip of the tented nail, then immerse it in boiling cow dung until the pain is eliminated.
And place that (the cow dung) in some way between, until the virtue of fire reaches the root of the teeth.
If you see, submerge the wool or cord into the border of what has been said, and place it on the aching tooth, and let it rest on that burning iron until the iron reaches the root of the tooth's cavity.
But still the cautery is on fire when you attend to the timing of the flame or iron, and it should not be in the core of him so that the heat does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And so extinguish the fire, which comes in the shape that it will be, and place it on the tooth and put your hand into it until the cauterium is slightly cooled; and do this occasionally because the pain subsides or in one day or in another day.
And be careful, because the impression of that cauterium makes the patient move his mouth to a good border and hold it for an hour and then vomit; and this is how one does the cauterium.
Cauterize as much as you see necessary, according to what is possible for you.
And this is the form of the tube:
The beginning of a chapter.
Treatment for protruding testicles.
When testicles are swollen due to inflammation and humors that cannot be expelled by medicine, and you wish to slightly induce evacuation of those humors, then you should know the fire treatment with which the form is as follows: having two extremities swollen so much that they cause smoke, you should apply the cautery on the other extremity, and pause it on the wart one day, and if you want another, enter until it reaches the root of the wart.
If the wart is small, then pause the cautery according to the size of the wart, and read it for three days, and put a hot border around it until it is remade that which the fire has burned.
And wrap that sore and cauterized area in cloth, to heal it.
Chapter 23.
Treatment for ulcer of the voice and constriction of the throat.
When the humors flow onto the surface of the lungs, and especially when there is inflammation of the complex, it is often covered that the disease should be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and cauterize that part due to the presence of the gallbladder in the affected area.
Guard yourself so that you do not apply the cauterization to the gallbladder and do not burn through its chain, but rather use a small amount.
Cauterize that part with another cauterization due to the joint of the neck at the lower end of the spine. The cauterization should be done like the previous one.
Apply to that part in such a way that it is healed before the disease.
Caput XXIV.
On the cautery of pulmonary disease and cough.
When cough is a disease of humors flowing and the disease does not have fever or phlegm, it is considered an old disease, so cauterize that part with two cauterizations over the furcula in the affected areas lymph nodes and buocytes; and another cauterization in the middle of the foot between two breasts; and apply the cautery like the previous form.
If you wish, this is your puncture procedure with a point to the same point that was previously indicated in the notation of the pain of the joints.
They are made in the cavities, and you should cure it with the same medicine that was previously indicated before it is healed.
Even if the point has three angles, because cautery is applied to it: you can do three punctures as follows.
Chapter 25.
On the cautery of a titletic, which is the head of the assistant.
When the head of the assistant is displaced due to excessive lubrication and does not fix itself in the hour of its return, and you cannot stop its displacement until it is returned to that place, because it customarily returns to that place, then with a small movement, it displaces again so that it comes back, as we have testified, often more quickly. Reduce first the displacement, and approach the ulcer on either his right or left side; and lift the bandage which is at the beginning of the titletic towards those parts where you said of your right hand without the finger.
And place the instrument with two handles in front of it; and this is how it looks like:
And let the cautery burn inside as it enters into the other flesh; and there will be a figure of cautery with four marks.
And some wounds are adjusted according to this count and for which the cauteries.
And place over the cautery a poultice of salt; and let the wound be closed in quietness, and the member not be injured for any time until it is comforted.
But if the dislocation is in the joints and bones, then it is done thus: let cautery be applied over the muscle, or over the joint with pointed cautery, until the joint is confirmed and the humidity is dried out, and the wound is healed.
Chapter xxvi.
Of the cautery of the stomach.
When pain comes into the stomach and motes of humidity enter that part of their composition, and if you continue with the usual methods of treatment and do not restrain them, then surely the illness is on its backside, and extend your hands and your cushions, and place cauteries three: one in each toe for the quantity of one small cauteri nail, and two in each side of the cauteri, between when the figure of cauteri triangle comes; and extend between those that are not joined together so that they will make a poultice.
And if the depth of the cauteri is equal to the thickness of two halves of the cord of the neck.
And if it is the form of the cauteri according to this shape, and if you wish, cauterize a large cauteri in the middle of the stomach according to this shape; and let this be a cauteri according to the form of circle according to this shape:
And cauterize the stomach punctually to that which is scared by this cauteri: and it is so that you sense over the punctured stomach according to the quantity that you wish with a tent, and place cauteries on those points; and cure those who have followed the treatment previously until they are healed.
The translation of line 1 is:
Treatment of the inflammation of the intestines.
When the intestine becomes inflamed due to coldness, humidity, or great windiness, and the patient's normal composition is affected by excessive evacuation, and the disease is cured as they have said, but do not comfort them, since you will place the patient on their back, and sense that the patient is trying to lie down three times on this form and this quantity over the intestine, those of the hypochondriacs, until the person feels.
And it is the space between which is according to the swelling of the finger, and it is according to the length of the body's curve.
Do not buy your own hands on the cauteris (tools).
And if the amount of water that is added is equal to the quantity of the mixture of the species of the codena (a type of medicine), and it's not too much adjusted; and if the disease is standing on the feet of him; and if it's not standing, then sit down, for he has already extended his limbs and elevated his arms.
It is to you that it is possible to perform these cauteries with the cauterizing knife, as long as you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
Be careful not to process too much in the cauterization, and be precise with the measure of the entire cord so that it is suitable for the whole body and enters into the intestines, as the cord here is subtle; and you know this.

On the perforation of apostema on the foot with a cautery.
When a swelling or apostema appears on the foot and you want to know if it is in the flesh of the foot or in the tunic of the foot, then if it is in the flesh of the foot, the sickness becomes more grave and pain increases in severity.
If it is in the tunic of the foot, with great pain and many times already exhausted are the doctors in curing him.
Therefore cover the patient over with the sheet of his bed; and take away the location of the swelling with a tent; and apply the cautery which is assembled like a rag, the form of which was shown on the previous page. The treatment begins by applying a cautery to the affected area, then waiting until the entire chain of nerves is numbed, until it reaches the spine, and until pain is no longer present.
Applying treatment to that by means of other sores or ulcers until it is healed.
It is not allowed to use this method of cautery unless that studied in the art of medicine is prolonged, and from the most known cases of illnesses; but however it has been practiced sometimes with great risk on this operation, but nonetheless we must follow that which is safer, and it is better.
Chapter XXIX.
On the cautery of ulcers.
Disse that the old cauterys of ancient times for arthritis in ulcers were effective according to this method, and you should take from the long dry root of aristerolia a long thin root which is found, and cut it of the thickness of the said.
And you should submerge that root in oil and then cover it with that on the fire, and you should apply a cautery at that location where the continuation of the furcula is near the neck; and having two small cauteris placed, one leaning towards the side which is to the left of the beard, and two more placed between the fifth rib and the navel, leaning slightly towards the behind parts; and one more in the middle of the foot; and another on the stomach, and three more in the behind parts; and one in that location where there are two spallae, and two cauteris from the two sides of the foot, with the cautery which is between the two spallae.

There is another way to cauterize, so you don't know the cauteri and have not two vertiments, which cause said in the chapter of muscle dislocation, elevating the tendon that is in the inner part of the flesh and holding back the left malaute without.
This is the way you lift it, which is lifting the tendon according to the length of the body, so that they may be done cauterizations according to the latitude of the body.
Now bring together the two verments, close tight, in that place where these penetrate the tendon of the other side.
And remove the cauteri; and therefore, four cauterizations.
If you see, cauterize with three vertiments.
And you cure the cauteri as it will have laid open for throwing back the arm in three days, because more is comfortable than the other previous causes in the cure.
A collection of medical procedures for treating gout.
Treatment for uric acid (or "yellow bile" in an outdated, humoral understanding of medicine) with cautery.
Cauterization is not for uric acid (or "yellow bile") but rather for a specific puncture or incision.
When treating uric acid (or "yellow bile") in the groin area, which are the procedures mentioned in the division that you should not apply yourself, but rather have another cure, because: to counteract it, he would apply four cauteries around the navel, and one cauterization on the stomach, and another on the liver, and another on the gallbladder, and two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and a cauterization in the third part of the foot, and another cauterization on the stomach. And the quantity of the depth of the cautery should be proportional to the severity of the condition.
And let the cauteries be applied deeply enough so that the leg does not swell for a long time.
And do not evacuate the wound of operation immediately after applying the cautery, because it is advisable to allow the addition of two incisions, and the wound will be closed with assistance from the healing process.
The instrument for cauterization should be hammered in such a way according to its form, and it is that one which has been cauterized on the abdomen.
Book XXXII.
On the cautery of feet and the groin area.
When the feet become swollen with dropsy and are filled with stagnant water, cover that area on the top of the foot between the ear and the little toe, and raise your hand against the cautery and do not turn it; then lift up your hand, and do not return to it entirely, because the stagnant water resists.
It is the cautery in this way: And place two cauteries over each groin, and on each one place a cautery with a cutting edge at its tip. It is the cautery according to the length of the groin: let one cautery be placed on the left side and another on the right side, about a third from each end; and over each groin, two cauteries.
The text means: And wash the wound thoroughly for a long time to prevent any water from causing it.
And treat those causes that have been mentioned.
Chapter xxxiii.
On the cautery of the belly.
When the belly is painful due to cold and humidity that irritates the vertebrae, so it is a digestive and retentive affliction, located in the stomach and intestines, which are cured with various methods and do not rely on [cures], for sometimes the malady suffers from cauterization of the digestive virtues exhibiting, namely, making a large cautery over the stomach according to what was preceded in the treatment of the stomach, with cauteries around the circle, four cauteries in the circumference of the umbilicus subtle, and subtle clavils, and cauteris on the silver over lozenges large, or two cauteries.
And if sometimes the humidities are overwhelming and the malady is tolerant, then he cures it by cauterizing it on the penisil and on the intestines, and with a little force attaching two cauteries to the stomach and next to the inguinos, which is perfect cure for youth which you will not err at.
The opening of the wound.
From the cautery of old hemorrhoids.
When they occur naturally as old hemorrhoids or are caused by a large quantity of foul humors or corrupted moisture, and cannot be cured with what has been said in the division, then cauterize them with three cauterizations over the pus left after the removal, on either side of the spondilus ( joint) of the two small and triangular bones, and on both sides of the umbilicus (belly button), by two incisions.
And if you think that the stomach of him is rubbed and his food is not digested, and his face often covered in pimples, then cauterize it over the stomach with a large cauterization as previously indicated; and one cauterization on the fetus ( possibly referring to a fetus or an embryo), and another cauterization on the lower part of him, on the flesh, with a cauterized nail, and leave the cauterization uncovered for some time, and return to his care until he is cured.
The remedies of the womb.
Of cauterizing atrophy after their removal.
When you cut away the cartilage, it is customary to ignite the cautery that resembles a thread. Place the ignited cautery inside the cut cartilage until it penetrates into the vein from which you see the wound.
And if it is twice or thrice, since the artery is hot, then cauterize one of them in accordance with what has been recounted, and apply the cure to those you give to drink so that their stomach may recover while it heals.
If you cauterize a large cautery over the skin, it will be more serious for the patient.
It seems like we've reached the end of this medieval medical treatise. Would you like to provide another section or stop here?
On the cautery of fistulas, which are pains in the natural parts of the body.
When nature does not obey the work we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by this, it cures with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has any fistula in the natural parts which are corrupt and inflamed, we send healing from there and apply humecting remedies, and therefore what is more worthy of consideration than that we try to subdue it with a gentle attempt, and take into account the quantity of the depth of it in front of said attempt.
Return the cautery that resembles a needle. And place that cautery on fire in this fistula, and according to the amount it infiltrates the tissue.
And pass over that cautery until those body parts are burned, rotting in a single day or two, or three, according to the quantity of your need.
Be careful of nerve and vein combustion, or if the fistula goes to the bladder or intestines, be careful about all those locations; do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think it's not penetrating.
Return to the wound until it is healed.
If the wound is sealed and the materials that are removed from it are absent for a long time, then you know it has been completely healed.
If the materials are not lost from it, then you know if it is penetrating or in the root of it has corrupted, or if this comes from one of those causes which will bring remembrance to its place.
A medieval medical treatise.
Treatment of the tonsils.
When the tonsils swell with pain from pressure or a large swelling, and so the fever of the disease is intensified, it is customary to cut it on the tonsils with a pointed instrument that has been pressed on each tonsil.
And lightly treat it on the second one with a small dose, so that there will come three linen stitches, and then be done later in moderation.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Treatment of the bladder.
When the bladder weakens and becomes soft due to pressure and humidity, so that the disease prevents urine retention, it is customary to cut it at the opening with a pointed instrument, placing less cauterization on the surface of the bladder, then starting the sutures from the neck of the bladder, cutting first on one side and then on the other.
And the length of each cauterization according to the number of stitches in the skin; and cut it with a pointed instrument on the lowest part of the back, or two if necessary.
The cauterization should be done according to its procedure.
On the thirty-ninth chapter.
About the cauterization of the ingrown nail.
When the ingrown nail becomes inflamed and humidified, and in order to prevent infection, it is forbidden to apply any pressure, and so its menses are corrupted, and it is delayed until the cause of this corruption, and accidents occur due to the incomplete handling of it, therefore as we said in the cauterization of the bladder; and after that cauterization should be done with three cauteries around the navel, just as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; or two cauteries, and a cauterized point on the other side, or two cauteries, and it is cauterized.
On the fortieth chapter.
About the cauterization of the dislocated joint.
When the humors are moistened and accumulated at the beginning of the joint, and cause pain due to the surrounding tissue of its location, and since it is obvious that the swelling is prolonged beyond the other when compared between them. The location of the dislocation is touched upon where the joint is swollen.
Therefore, cauterize the boil over the spot where it began, with a sterile needle-like instrument, since you will have seen the attempt in the surrounding area as if it were reversed, and thus the boil will fall into the middle of the circle.
And it is the same type as that which preceded the form in stomach cauterization.
If that cauterization is not to your present hand, then you should apply three cauterizations with an olive large cauterization.
Let it be done with the cauterization according to the quantity of the eschar of the whole cord, and place care in that area so that it heals.
Chapter forty-one.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs at the spot of the boil and is caused by cold and humidity, the boil is cured with what we have said, and do not trust in it, as this is an old remedy, then consider that you release the boil from gross humors with fetid pills or artificial pills similar to them, and cauterize that.
The method of cauterization in that area follows two methods: either by applying medicinals that burn, or by applying fire.
This is done according to two known methods, of which one cuts on the departure point of the hernia with three triangular cauterizations, and applies them to a good depth. And the space between each cauterization is equal to the amount of swelling on that part, and if it is olive or large.
Some are placed on the middle location, under the head of that person, so there are four cauterizations.
If you wish, cut the circle on which the shape is positioned in the cauterization of the dislocation of the ankle, the one that is a continuous circle and burn the bone.
This is the method of cauterization for cataract when pain is attached to the ankle and not spread into the cavity.
But if it has spread into the cavity, then she cuts that with two cauterizations over the cavity on the place where you bring in the malady, which is the pain; and one cauterization on the bone for four days a little before the cistral part.
If the cautery knife cuts, and the depth of the cautery is according to the amount of the incision of the cord.
If the pain is spread throughout the area where the foot is affected, then cauterize that place with a cautery for three points or four or more if it requires.
If the pain is spread throughout the wound in the groin area, then cauterize that place with a cautery knife.
Be careful in all cauterization that does not leave the knife on burnt nerves or great arteries, for this is because it will cause unnecessary evil or contraction.
You have also seen another of those who cauterize on the marrow bone and then in the cauterization, and an inflated candle flame inside where the tumor achieves the flesh, and the hot needle perforates and corrupts all the flesh. And therefore a strong acid solution is a solution to the abdomen, and also death.
If the pain is in two separate parts of the joints, cauterize each one according to this manner.
They say the wise men of the cauterization of that type, of which this is the manner: make a similar circle of iron from which the circumference should be the size of a palm; and it should be of the same size as their orifices according to the thickness of an almond bone or one quarter.
And then the circle is drawn another time; and the space between them, equal to the width of the foot's nail; and those circles are on both sides; and the length of those points should be one or two nails, and put the iron fittings decently in the margins of the circles; and this is the form of it:
Then it is ignited in the fire where it becomes red and gets sparks, and then place it on the point of that one, the sick person laid on the side. And therefore cauterize that part three times, returning to one place.
And let it heal for three days; apply that plaster over the border, and let the wound be covered with ointment for three days; and cure that part with poultice until it is healed.
Diys Albucasis says: Oh sons of the world, this type of cautery is rarely used for fear of observing it, and so few have found those which regard it.
But the bodies of those who endure this cautery become distorted and afflicted with that location.
But cautery is medicine that makes you do two circles around the armature perforated in which the cork of the door of iron should be placed, its length equal to half the circumference of their body.
And if the space between them is according to the size of that thing, and there are above and below, and they contain it in the middle according to this shape:
And place your hand over the opening of the wound on the side that is sick, and cover it with your palm; take hot water and flow between two circles, and observe its quality by placing a small fire under it, little by little, for the amount of one hour, until the disease ceases to bite and becomes loose - as if bitten by fire - until it stops biting.
Raise your hand with the instrument and absorb the hot water from all the accumulated pus with cool water.
Let him cleanse it for three days and rest on that border until the blackness of the suppurated discharge appears, then let him cleanse it again for another three days, and run to his food; this is considered to be childbed fever.
Treat the patient with quince until they recover.
If the pain is extended into the groin or between the thighs, place him in a position where he contains water as it was done in the cauterization.
This is the way of hot water, and I have already written about it in The Treatise on the Refinement of Medicine. Recipe for alum and caustic: Take one part of each, crush them, and place them in a new poultice from which the separated parts leave through a small slit, according to the quantity that enters into it.
Place the bottom of the poultice in another poultice spread out, and apply to that caustic and live alum in cool water which causes it to draw blood per a finger, and then compress it well with your hand; let the pus drain from it as long as it comes from the poultice laid out.
A propósito di tutto quel acqua, e getti sopra un' altra causa viva e un'altra acque renovellata, che là tanto si rende di moto forta acquietamento, la qual è amministrata in molte operazioni di medicina e in cauterizzazione degli altri membri, che opera fa del foco.
And some of these medicines are applied extensively, as with the application of zeolite and meil (mel) to a caustic substance in order that they may be mixed.
And Gualia recounts the case of an old man from which the operation and cure is told, in which he was cured of acute pain in his groin and sciatica, and it magnified how much better he became, and they say that none had any need for another cure, and that she (Gualia) was healed just as quickly as recommended, with only rest in bed and eyes closed at that.
And it is that he (the patient) was pressed against a certain green color, and if it's not the right green, then he's pressed with fresh figs; and some are thrice pounded with a little gray and placed over the groin in which the pain is, or on the chest, or in the space, and tied.
It should be laid on the patient for three hours or according to the amount of pain it causes in the joint.
Place the patient in bed and when his body is relaxed, insert that into the ground, so that pain ceases and he is healed.
You know that one should not use cauterization on these medicines, but rather the evacuation of the body.
But Mayes de Scorza says that when you make an incision in the goat's vein, the vein tightens and it is cauterized more effectively; thus, it is done so: take wool and apply it to olive oil, and place it between the foot's toes and the hoof.
So take dried goat skin and apply it to the area that has been heated with carbon, and then place it over the wool and press down until it is tightened. And iterate water, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of biting has gone through to the bone and rest the pain.
And this method of cautery is called cattle cautery.
Chapter Forty-one.
On the cautery for two pains.
Some pains occur in the two feet due to excessive causes, such as a fall or percussion, or from an excessive evacuation, and for similar reasons, by infusion of wet matter.
Cautery is not for all, but only for this single sort which is made by infusion of wet matter.
Therefore, remove the sickness with good pills and ones similar to them, that may be fitted on the two feet where pain lies in three lines according to its location, since every time you put cautery or more, ten times as much as before, according to the tolerance of the sick person and their virtue.
It is done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, puncture with three or four punctures of the middle claw, according to this form:
Book XLIII.
On the Cauterization at the Beginning of Gout.
Visible signs of this disease appear in the small children; and it is characteristic of its beginning in children that they suffer from a narrowing of their feet, swelling of the legs, and increased elevation and movement.
And it is more pronounced in the lower back, and in the two vertebrae of the neck that are already beginning to show signs of inflammation above the other vertebrae.
And therefore when you have to cut it and want to stop the inflammation, then do so with a circular cautery of this shape: which holds the cautery over all the inflamed part of the vertebra.
And if you wish, cut in a circle around the vertebra with a pointed cautery having two or three lines. And these are the points applied between them.
Then cover the place with a plaster or application as we have described.
Do not use cautery on someone who has gout that is caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter XLIV.
On the cautery of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Therefore it is cured by a method of treatment other than applying cold to prevent the pain.
And so, you cauterize that area after evacuation at the junction of the foot with a pointed cautery.
And it is done by olive wood cautery, which is this its form:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise into the joints or other joints, and that often hurts, then cauterize that area with three or four pointed cauteries on each joint with olive wood.
If you need to apply cautery on those that require it, then apply the cautery and do not press too hard on your hand with the cautery before, so only surrounding the spot of the wound.
If the pains are causing inflammation in both the bone and joint, then apply the cautery which we have discussed in the chapter.
If the pains are solely in the marrow, and it is called gout, then make points in the joint as if you were rolling up a spindle, with points in those two lines.
If some pains remain in the fingers, then make points on the joint of any finger and on the nail.
If the pains are near the muscles or joints, then cauterize those points on all parts of the affected joint.
And do not evacuate the patient from a good regimen and reception of medicines, for if it is done in a bad manner, with cautery as an antidote, it will be harmful, God helps.
Book XLV.
Treatment for ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin area and you push the intestines back into the pelvis, but as soon as you let go, they come back out again, it is customary to have the patient refrain from food for that day and use lenient measures so that the tear of his belly may heal.
Let the patient lie between your hands under his feet and command him to hold his belly until it is completely flat or the intestine or hernia appears.
And then return him to those tight bandages and tie again the rupture over the femoral bone, with the handle of which should be like the middle part of a circle at the lower parts of the body.
And now hold the cauterium from which this is the form:
When the heat of the body has cooled down and the fumigation has been done, then it is time to apply. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent it from coming out.
And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And place the cautery on that spot, with your hand holding the cautery straight, until you discover the bone of the penis in the middle of the duct; and then go to another place if you have not succeeded in the first place into the bone.
Observe carefully the swelling of the intestine at the time of your cautery, so that you do not burn that intestine otherwise the disease may come upon the patient with death or great evil.
Be aware that when you have the cautery and do not reach the bone, do not proceed with your operation.
The translation is:
Appropriate care must be taken for the point on the surface of the cautery for three days, so that it is covered with scab and heals.
Appropriate care must be taken for the other wounds until they heal.
And the patient must remain on their back for forty days until they are marked, the site, and the plague is sealed.
And it must be considered that the patient's nutrition is paused according to the length of time for their treatment, so that they do not develop a hernia again through the effort to heal.
And when it is necessary to take them away after forty days, they should be given something decently made, and held for another forty days.
And it is considered that they should rest from work and relief of food and drink, and from voice, for when using this regimen of treatment the entire body receives healing.
And you must direct the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, and this should be done first, that they do not heal, for as long as the cautery is made around that wound again, according to its quantity, and so it is extracted from the chain as with the other part of him; and appropriate care must be taken for that wound which has been mentioned, and if it does not adhere.
They first said that rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this shape, because it is marked on the attempt:
It is laid down a line that goes across the latitude in the remaining part of the rupture, and another line above; and you place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterying of a knot or cord.
When you come upon a member by falling or by percussion, and the pain persists for a long time and does not yield to medication with medicines, then cover that wound with a pointed cautery.
And apply the pointed cautery to the entire limb according to its size and shape, as well as its surface and location of the knot and pain.
Therefore, if the patient heals from the first cautery, then it is so; and if not, then iterate over it with the cautery; because in those kinds of pains they are punctured points on that member itself, close to it, in order to be able to attain them with the cautery before the disease is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cautery of leprosy.
Some leprosy cases are treated with cauterization due to a large and stubborn wound, only if the type of leprosy made by putrefaction of flesh and melancholy.
And therefore, if you want to cauterize that one, consider whether the leprosy is common and has been treated with what was said in the division, do not do it, and beware of the illness that the corruption will encompass throughout his body and all its complexity. When doing so on the head, do as follows: place a cautery at one end of the head, just above the hair, and secondly below it; and on both sides, over the temples; and one in back, over the neck or shoulder.
And finally, after applying the cautery a little while, before it takes hold in the bone and presses upon it a small impression, the swellings are displaced, so that the expiration of great vapors is alleviated from him; and cauterize on the armpit as desired.
If the leprosy has already spread over the disease and is manifestly appearing, then cover that you cauterize those places that have been mentioned in the head; and cauterize on the extremity of the nose, and two cauteries on each majestas, and two cauteries on each vertebra of the neck, and four cauteries on the vertebrae of both, and one big cauterization near the knee, and one over the knee, and two over the ankles, and one over any ankle, and two over the dols, and one over any dolh, and two over the coddes, and two over the muscles, and two on the tendons of their feet; and cauterize those on all the joints of both arms and legs, and on every toe of their feet, and on the foci of their bones.
Watch well that which is over the nerves that are on the toe, so as not to burn them.
And sometimes there is a cauterization with one cautery over the bone of the little toe and another over the mouth of the stomach, and another over the intestines.
When the more points are made on the cautery, the more healing and comfort are gained; and you know that the disease does not have pain in the cautery, like it has elsewhere, so that the body of him is already stung.
And know that the cautery points can be great or small according to the members and joints, as it has been preceded by the specialities of the instruments.
And wrap the cautery with flour, oats, and honey, and another cure in between to heal.
Chapter 48.
On the cautery of stupor.
When any member is stiffened or numbed and it is cured with medicines, oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then you cautery that member with points according to how much the member deserves in terms of its size or smallness.
And if your cautery penetrates the skin a little bit. And wrap that wound with linen until it heals.
When certain joints are cauterized to treat a stupor that affects the muscles and bones, and also causes pain in the feet and spindles of the two toes and eyesight of the nerves which affect that member, then it is remade.
It is not assumed to be the case, but rather that which is wise in anatomy of the limb and movement of the nerves throughout the whole body moves.
Chapter 49.
Of the cauterization of swellings that are warts or morphea.
When a wart is old and you do not treat it with the art of medicine's poultice, then you cauterize it on that spot with a cauterization tool for a short time, according to the quantity of the specific mixture of the cordial inside until it is remade white and its color changes.
And then cure that spot with flour of oats and lentils mixed with rose oil and leaves of arnica, or with the powder of dove or of yarrow, each one being divided into parts and all mixed together, and wrap it in a cloth and place it on that spot until healing.
The beginning of a chapter or section, possibly indicating a division in the treatise.
On the cautery of the wart.
When cancer begins to form and you wish to remove that tissue, then do so by cauterizing it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as if it were turned.
However, the wise men advise that it should be cauterized at the root end of the cautery in the middle place; but I have not seen this done, for I fear it may cause an ulcer, and I have observed this before.
And it is better to cauterize in the circumference of the thing with a circular motion as we have said, or with another cauterization.
End of this chapter.
On the cautery of adulteries.
When an adulterate is delayed in maturation, and it does so because of excessive flesh or due to the state of the malady, which is old and decrepit, either from scarcity of medicine, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the adulterate; then cauterize it in its circumference with small cauterizations, and place a cloth over it so that it will mature faster.
If you want the perforation of the ulcer with cauterium, then you must know how to handle the cauterium of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the application before it penetrates the vein.
And if the cauterium is placed in that location where it leaves pus, so that the arm of the patient may be alleviated; and apply treatment until it is healed.
Chapter the Twelve.
On the cauterization of ulcers.
An ulcer is a wandering corruption in the limb, which corrupts that area as if it were a consuming fire eating dry wood.
Therefore if the ulcer occurs in a place where cauterization is applied with fire, then you know to apply small cauterious needles and larger ones according to what is convenient in that location where it is an ulcer.
And apply cauterization to it from the entire part until all the corruption is eradicated and no further cause remains.
And let it be healed for three days, and place a poultice on the cauterized places soaked in oil mixed with treacle until all the scars are eradicated and all the corruption.
Healing that foul-smelling carrion-generating flesh.
But three days have passed since the flesh began to heal, provided there is no corruption; but rather, if the cautery is iterated over those areas that are rotten.
Corrosion is treated with some sharp points in the sharp medicine, for that is a point instead of cautery. But cautery is the focus of lighter pus recently accumulated.
And I have already said the treatment of him with sharp medicine in the division, and therefore take that which you will when he has begun to degenerate.
End of chapter III.
On the cautery of nails and other similar things.
Small nails inserted into the diseased parts that call for a nail, and this is a great cause of pain in the foot; and cautery is performed in these two ways: cautery with pus and cautery with hot water.
Cautery is the fuel that you must ignite in a similar manner to a torch, which should be made of iron according to the quantity it contains, and should have subtle margins.
Place the ignited torch over the key, and return your hand to the cautery in the circuit of the key until the cautery penetrates to the depth of the key. Let it be there for three days before you start to feel a pull in the arm. Apply a poultice made of wild marrows crushed with salt upon that arm for one night, so that the poultice may eradicate its roots.
Treat the spot with animal fat of a generative nature until it is healed.
If it does not convert, and many visible accidents occur on the surface of the body, mainly in the muscles and feet, then cover that with cautery water; take a quill or iron or torch-point, and place it over the key; put in the quill of water a little quantity, and hold your hand, and turn that with compression of your hand from top to bottom, and press the edge of the quill into the root of the claw, and pour water via the point of the claw to the root of the wound; and wait for the patient for a bit before the wound is eradicated by the mordicatio of the water.
And I will come over those and place them inside each of what is in their body.
And remove those pus that the roots of the claws are eradicated inside, with the disease from which the skin is inflamed.

Of the cauterization of trembling.
When the disease makes a tremor by pressing on the nerves or by fever due to cold or another similar cause, then cover that area with four cauteries or five over the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra there is one cautery; and there are cauteries in the foot of it, and over the stomach of it, olive cauteries.
And when the trembling of him is pacified and hastened the recovery of the illness, it freezes.

Of the cauterization of white, accidental marks on the body.
When the body is affected by a pale complexion and pus-filled ulcers caused by corrupted materials, therefore at the beginning of an appearance, let it be cauterized on all head of the fistula with a subtle cautery made from a mitten's frame or extended to its tip with fire; or with razitz's long erestologia; or lentecular cautery.
And some times it is cauterized at the same time as the expulsion of its contents according to this manner; and you do not believe me, and that surplus flesh is disrupted and cured from those.
But it is also thought to be done at the same time as evacuation with flebotomies.
Chapter 56.
On the cautering of fluxes that arise after a splinter injury by archery through cutting with a bowstring.
Sometimes the arrow flux which is caused by an incision from the plague, or from the deforestation, or from the starting of aphthae or cautery on a limb, and thus similar, it is difficult to remove that one.
When something happens to that person, then immediately put your hand at the entrance of the archery wound and pause on that place until you see the bloody fluid coming out from that place, so that it does not run.
And pause in the fire, applying olive oil few and many, for many times, and inhale over them until they are ignited.
And take one of those small or large as the wound and the artery is ruptured in which the vein is swollen, over that place persistently so that you have rubbed your said, and then cauterize until it closes and restricts that blood.
If the blood is expelled from the artery's wound when you rub your said and extract the cautery, then take another cautery contemporaneously with those that have been prepared in the fire, and therefore do not cease doing this until the blood is constricted.
And be careful that you do not burn the nerves which are here, and that another evil comes upon the sick person.
The translation of the first sentence is:
What person who administers a moderate restriction of the patient's limbs and bands or ties on their position for the movement of causes to burn and for similarity, only provides comfort.
If it is to be done without the doctor present and no medicine, then work slowly on the said instruction over the opening of that vein as we have said, and consider the great constriction inside where the wound will be left from the superior part of the plague, and about the arrow he said should not be removed; and since about the arrow it is not suitable to apply water friction with a large friction in between, until the wound is closed and hardened; and perhaps there is something that needs cauterization or medicine.
Of incisions and perforations and wounds with a tube, and of fluybotomy and of plagues and of their similarities.
We have already stated in the first chapter all disease in which cauterization with fire is convenient and medicine applied, and the occasions and causes of them, and the instruments required for it, and I have ordered the chapters to follow from this one under the feet.
The text means: And I will proceed in this chapter with that method, so that what he is seeking may be found there, and later on when he asks about it.
When starting this procedure, son, you sons, that you will learn here in this chapter is about fear of this what was in the first chapter of cautery.
And therefore, son, because of which you must be in great caution, that in this operation which is in this chapter many times the evacuation which is called sanc, am, where life depends on the application of the vein or incision over the wound or suspicion of existence or discharge or removal of the plague or extraction of a splinter or beginning of an ulcer, and to their likeness. And therefore those also are accompanied by terror and trembling, and in the most of their cases death.
And I warn you not to fall into this in which it is situated, because sometimes the case may lead you to become maniacal as men are, with various kinds of madness and many other illnesses. And from them it is often that you will go to your own disease and find light in it because of death, and so by the vehemence of this thing which finds its illness, and by the length of the illness of him, and with the illness there is fear which means death.
And from those who give you their son's pain and word, you expect to have that healing, and his illness is very destructive.
And therefore do not trust someone who shows you this kind of behavior; and your caution must be greater than your desire, and your greed; and do not presume any cause about it except for sure knowledge that verifies it for you, which will bring a good succession.
And use this treatment for all your diseases with prognosis and indication of it to whom healing is converted, because in that one are you an assistant for the gain of fame and memory, of honor and glory.
Oh, sons, God is in your understanding and does not abandon you in direction and protection, for it is in his hand.
And I have ordered this distinct chapter according to the chapters following the capital of cauterization, of treatment for the head into the feet, so that it may be alleviated what you are asking for from it and from which you had a necessity.
First chapter.
The healing of water which is contained in the head of children.
Know that this illness occurs frequently in children, causing the child to be weak and when the newborn touches the head of the child, it causes a convulsion.
And sometimes occurs for an unknown cause which is not known.
But you do not see this illness in others, only in children; and for all those whom you have seen dying, and for that reason it is laid upon me as an example.
And you have seen a child whose head was completely filled with water, and the child's head remained magnificently still even though it couldn't be stirred because of its great size, and besides, the moisture caused it to become more dead.
And this moisture was either added between the tendons and the bone, or placed over the joints of the body.
Where the operation in that case is to make an opening in the middle of the head at a fissure in the latitude, and so that the length of the fissure is two fingers' breadth until the moisture runs, and this is the form of the spatula:
If the humidity is greatly increased and the swelling is greater, then you will have two cuts in this way:
If the humidity is left on the bones, it's a sign that you will cut across the corners of the head where all the parts are open and when you compress her with your hand on those parts, she will urinate when you press that area. You will cut across the middle of the head in three cuts, according to this method:
And then you will remove the extraneous part from all the humidity; and then tie the cuts with cloths and plums, and apply it on top with vinegar until the fifth day, and then loosen the bandage and cure the wound with cauterization and salve, and strengthen the head with equality; and feed the sick person with dry food of little humidity within that the member is comfortable and healthy.
And this is another method of incision, which I consider good when the size of the swelling and the collection of fluid appear, because some cases are more in the occipital region, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; therefore follow the opening where the swelling appears and the repletion of fluid, and do it as seems to you most suitable.
And observe that you must not cut the artery, but instead seek out the flow of life and death in the patient's disease through this flow of life, and evacuate excess humidity.
Chapter Second.
When you have encountered an ulcer or wound on the heel or foot, and it is old and does not respond to medicine, then you should look for the beginning of those two arteries.
And therefore cover when you want to incise those that the disease is in his head, and apply pressure to the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and tie the neck of the patient tightly with a cloth; and consider whether to press on a vein; and the areas where each artery must be located, and if hidden, will become apparent after a few days.
And place a ligature over the artery at the point where it is severed, and incise each one with the sharp edge of each cut, entering through the bone until it reaches the width of the skull.
If you wish, introduce the spoon between the artery and the vessel, and tie it so that it touches the incision at the affected parts.
If the length of the incision is twice the thickness, because when any vein is cut, there is exsudation and blood flow, which jumps forward for repeated pulsations.
But if the artery does not appear at the surface, then how do you know that you must measure the space of three fingers, and place your needle inside, and feel into the bone.
And thus it is known that the amount of exsudate is equal to one vial, and a light or heavy flow (of blood) more or less, and all this is according to the quantity that appears from the virtue of the illness and the repletion of the artery.
And therefore, considering the plague, if there remains over the bone any cause of a ciphac ( possibly referring to a lingering infection or issue), then divide this as well in order not to inadvertently discover an apostaem ( likely meaning "apostema" or "pouch", but in this context, it seems more like a complication that should be avoided).
Apply strength to the wound with plump poultices and liniment of wool, and apply cure to that with ointment until it is healed.
Chapter three.
Of the extraction of the tonsils which are in the temples.
When an accident occurs and the old ulcer or wart migrates to another place due to humidity and irritation, of poor quality in the temple's cartilage, or because it is old and similar to that, and you treat it with various methods of treatment for medicine, but not as we have shown extraction of tonsils from temples, or cauterization of those same areas just like we showed.
And the way of performing and extracting those is what causes the disease to spread through the areas where it is in the temples; and understand that the ulcerous appearance on the temple which is at your demonstration by its polyp, is occulted only in a few men because of the heat.
And if it is occulted, then the ulcer is strengthened with some wool; and apply pressure on the spot with a rough cloth or evaporate the spot with hot water until you see it manifest as an ulcer. And now then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you scrape the cord of which this is the form: take it in your hand and facilitate entry into the arrow-making; and place yourself on a surface where you can extract that part above the joint while extracting it from the cord and discovering those under the tunics which are left behind, of all parts.
But if the artery is thin, then you wrap that around the extremity of the vein; and place a incision on one part of it according to the quantity by which the extremities of him are stretched out and contracted, lest there be no flow of blood, for if they are not incised, the blood will not rise from all.
And now evacuate the blood of one vein into three.
But if the arrow is large, then you cover that by tying it in two places with strong linen or with cords long, and do not cut to the putrid flesh before the consolidation of the disease, lest there be no flow of blood.
Appropriate incisions are made in the superfluity that is between two limbs; and do this at that hour or another.
If you want, cauterize that area with a heated instrument inside the bone; and this will replace the messy work.
It is better work if the patient does not have fever or chills; for those are causes that can help with drying out the humors, and therefore it is better to do it early.
Cover the extraction of the arteries that you find in the affected area, and place powders on them decently made, and apply ointment with drying medicines to the flesh so that it heals.
If while you work another unexpected flow of blood from the artery occurs, then you restrict that vein, or cauterize it, or fill in the wound, and strengthen your hand until the vein is restricted. If none of these is the cause that brings it to your attention, then pause and speak about this place while the wound cools down, and fill in the place with hot water until the area becomes more solid, and strengthen as you can.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
This is how the cautery is made:
The sharpness of the two knives should be equal. But if one is sharper than the other, it is better, because when they are sharp enough like two knives, every cut will be clean and won't cut the meat too quickly.
So when there is no any swelling, the heat of the fire is kept in those places and the flesh is cut lightly.
And this work is better than all other works and it cuts more lightly.
Is the space between two knives equal to the thickness of the cut.
The end.
On the treatment of sharp and acidic wounds of the liver.
When the wounds are acidic, and it is the liver of those veins that are over the testicles before, and no cause of treatment is found in medicine, and often the face of the patient becomes red and he walks around with a tremble, as if he were walking like ants, the liver of that person becomes exhausted, burned and infected, so that its surface feels numb, and the eyelids are scarred by the acidity of the tears, and old wounds should be treated in this operation, and it is called "scassa".
You command the madman to cut off his hair which is in his forehead, and place three incisions in the forehead, extending downwards equally apart according to the length of the forehead. If the length of the incision is two digits: one incision extends downwards along the length from the middle of the nose to the forehead, and the second follows the length of a small part of the movement of the lacrimal, which is located at the other end.
Watch carefully the beginning of the arrow shafts which are in two sides, and extend your hand to cover the continuity between both mandibles. If each incision space is three digits apart,
If there is to you a pulse felt or cloth soaked with blood on the which the heart beats.
And place between the space of two sharp extremities, the form of which is this: that is from the departure of the temple between the second incision. Excavate the entire cord that is between two incisions, with the phalanges on which it is situated over the bone, and make this opening halfway into the second incision. Properly straighten the space and enter into the first incision with another instrument, which is called a scissor, sharp from one side and not sharp from the other.
Pause the edge of that sharp instrument from the meat adjacent to the cord, and the edge that touches the bone, and apply it so that it enters into the half-split fracture, and cut off all those vessels that descend from the head to the heels.
Continue the incision to that point of the cord, and make it in the middle fracture into the other fracture.
And then cut off the remaining quantity of the cord, and expel the swollen parts from the foot of the patient.
Properly pause in any liquid-filled fracture of old wound, and place over those powder-like particles in the vein, oil, and vinegar, so that they do not cause thrombosis.
When the third day comes, the patient will loosen the ligament and administer a large infusion of hot water or tea, and apply treatment with basilicon oil and other things into wounds so that the plagues be healed.
It seems like you're adding some sort of punctuation mark or symbol to indicate a break in thought or a pause. If I were to translate it, I'd say "Ah" or simply leave it as is since it's not directly related to the text being translated.
Of the treatment of leprosy by cautery and applications from parts descended from the divided digits of the head.
When the vein of leprosy is cut and continues, and sometimes the warts of the sick are peeled off small pieces, and they observe their weakness, and their ulcerated eyes, and of their death the eyelids, and in the forehead there is sharp pain and severe extortion, therefore it is known that such accidents occur when the material and cautery do not enter but through thin veins from parts descended.
And the best cure for these is that you command the sick person to rub his face, and then inscribe in him a small fissure at the middle of the forehead, a little wide (and begins from the temple on the left into the right temple; and inscribe into the bone; and extend your hand from the lacrimal groove of the temples which are swollen due to mastication), until the bone is uncovered.
Dry the entire wound with sponge or dry cloth, and then fill it in between the two lips of the fissure with old wool or rags. Apply powder in between the wound to prevent infection from spreading.
When you see that the infection has decreased and it starts to spread into the bone marrow, then cover that area with a treatment of moist heat which makes the flesh swell, as if you took 2 parts of wheat flour and 4 parts of cochineal powder, mix them together, and make an ointment from them, and apply it to these wounds on the skin, like the natural nativity.
Chapter VI.
On the treatment of a disease occurring on the ears.
All the diseases that occur on the ears are one of four species: (1) one is due to mineral causes or something similar to minerals, like iron and vinegar; (2) another is from plants, such as chamomile or fennel; (3) another is a fluid cause, like water, bile, and their similar effects; or (4) some animal.
When pain is felt in the armpit or another cause similar to those that do not fit or believe in the armpit, and pause the armpit in the sun, and if it happens sometimes the pain, then it distills in that one cause of oil violated or sizeless, and place aminister the extraction from it, and do the stornudar with condition, and inspect the nars to see the event of stornutacio. Place the armpit in some padded weights or woolen cloth and extend it to its parts, many times forgotten with these causes.
And if it is not forgotten, then administer the extraction from it with the instrument called gesti epicicarios subtle of which this is the form:
If it is forgotten with the gesti, then so be it; otherwise, administer the extraction from it with one subtle needle of double puncture.
Therefore, if it is not forgotten for this, then administer a cannula made of ram and insert the extremity of the cannula into the groove of the armpit and close it around the cannula with wax and soft oil to prevent it from bursting but rather the cannula. The translation of the text line by line into English is:
If the joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And then introduce it into the hollow of the armpit with ease, and excise the armpit from moisture.
Therefore if it is not forgotten all the causes that have been recounted, then you cut to that point where you will encounter either apoplexy or spasm.
And the way to cut that is to first treat the fever of the septic vein and extricate it according to the method of its virtue, then you put your fingers between your palms and convert the armpit to the parts before, and make a small fissure in the rate of the armpit, before the grease of him in that place. And it is the lunar-shaped fissure between where it proceeds to the pyr (should be "pyora", likely meaning "throat") and when the throat is constricted, cut that with instruments of suitable quality; then place a cloth over the fissure in that hour, and cure that until there is health.
If the cause is found in the swelling, it's an excess of fat that inflames and causes it, then administer treatment and remove it; but if you don't obey my advice immediately, then you must take some subtle sponge soaked in wine according to this form: administer the excision of that fat which has come into the swelling.
Do not do this when you think that it already is moistened by the vapor of the swelling, and put a cloth on it, and carefully remove it from those places, or with a subtle gesture, or as we say, because it has been removed, relief comes from its extraction.
But if the water that is introduced into the swelling has been used by the sickness for sneezing at the beginning, and fills its swelling with a certain hot vinegar, and pours it over that swelling where the water is, and if by this means it is forgotten, then so be it; but if not, then take smaller peppers and lemons according to the length of the hand, and warm them up in the fire for a little, and let the patient put one of these into the track of his swelling and jump over that part, and strike with another pepper on the pepper which is inside the swelling. When all the water has been drained out.
When all the water has been drained out. And when the water has been completely drained, take paper or cloth in hand, and put one end of it on the ear and stretch the other end towards the fire so that the skin is burned with its heat.
And put the other cloth on and do this many times until all the water is completely drained, and thus tie the artery in such a way as it is said of the external ear.
But if an animal enters that ear, whether it's of small or large size, and if it causes swelling in the ear, do the same cure as we have said in the division; but if it is of great size, which causes a lump on the surface of the skin, place the extraction of it with gestures and pinches, because its cause is lighter than all other causes that occur in the ear.
But if an worm is born in the ear when you cure it with the remedy that we have said in the division and in the treatise on evacuations, do not confirm your cure, because then you should observe the ear under the sun.
And therefore if some cause of the words appears here, then immediately extract that gesture or subtle movement, but if no cause appears, then take a straight tube and a long one from which this is the form. And introduce the subtle extremity into the armpit according to the amount which sufficed to treat the disease; and take a suck on it strongly, and do this movement several times, until all the words are made silent.
But if it does not obey to your assistance, then plug and close in the tube with wax as we have said; then administer digestive liquids which have already been tried on the ancient treatments of the words, and find out this also in the treatise on digestives.
And it is the method by which you pour medicinal oils onto the armpit with this tool, from which this is the form of doing so: And make that of silver or of horn, straight, with a small prick, and a plate under.
And therefore it comes that they must be driven into the cavity of the continence vessel here, where it is necessary to go. If you wish, take the lance and wrap it around the extremity of the limb decently bound, and place oil in the cavity of the ascension, or honey from some herb, or water that you wish from these medicines in the vessel — and that is on the armpit —, and put the lance with the bandage over it and press your hand upon that so as to compress it before the oil is expelled into the cavity of the ascension and the disease feels the oil penetrating.
And what is poured into the armpit is already sealed with a small flame. And beware that the cause you will drain into the armpit is not too frothy, because the medicine of the armpit does not suffer this.
Chapter VII.
Of the cure for swelling of the armpits.
There are certain cases in which the child's belly swells because of its mother's imperforated uterus, and this happens also in some women, swelling in the meat of the armpit due to plague or due to nothing at all being in that area; and this swelling sometimes is caused by the swelling of the preone of the armpit-trough which they do not notice at first, and sometimes it occurs outside.
A person who experiences a problem in their arm that they do not understand is likely to have a more difficult recovery.
In a case where the person is able to understand their symptoms, it is recommended that you pause the movement of the afflicted limb in the sun and observe carefully. And therefore if there is sometimes oppression that appears above the skin, then use this subtle tool which is its form:
If the extremity of the person where the latitude is small, one part being acute and the other not; and the spatula has two edges sharp so that it does not hurt the skin.
And therefore if the opacity is due to born-in skin on the forehead or in the flesh of the person, then use that same subtle knife and penetrate with great force until all the skin is removed.
And if the opacity is in the arm of the forehead, then take a subtle knife sharp and burn that same thing a little, and place it in the flesh of the forehead.
And therefore if you have sensed the oppression which the affliction has caused with great ease, through gravity of being forced, force the oppression of that limb with great ease, and be careful not to plague the nerves of the arm.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Mares, if the flow of pus occurs, then you must submerge it in a sponge or cloth in water and press on the ear, and use another cure that restricts the flow of pus, which is said to be in the treatise on distillation.
In the eighth chapter, it is customary to have a servant bring water from the nearby stream or well and use it to clean the area around the wound.
Concerning the cure of atezil, which is done on the eyelids.
Atezil, which is done on the eyelids of the eye, are either moistened with saliva or some times they are dry.
Then cover the ones with honey or oil, and incise those with the razor blade of your fingers, and place pressure over the affected areas.
But if there is pain with the flow of pus coming from a vein, then you should cauterize those with the cauterized lancet.
And the better cauterization is to apply the incisions and follow up the wounds until there is no remaining cause of the rash; and when they are cauterized with fire, those rashes are burned away and do not return.
Capital Chapter IX.
Treatment for swelling that occurs at the eyelids of the eyes.
Small knots or nodules found in the eyelids of the eyes which are assembled into great size in their strength and hardness, and for that reason it is called.
And this is an accumulation of great humidity in the eyelid, above and below.
Therefore the operation in their case is that they consider if the swelling is coming from inside, where it appears in the eyelid and is malignant to its entire extent; and the cause of this is light.
So make an incision over that fistula according to its length, and carefully extract it from the entire extent with a facilitating instrument, and suspend it in one ounce and cut it up.
And if the figure is large, then you adjust it with a suture; and cure it inside so that it may be healed.
If it is little, you will not be overcome by that evil for that, as his blood restores what was lost and covers.
If the size is declining from the edges of the eyelid, place the surface under the eyelids, and then lift the lid and push the size back with one ony, other than what you suspect as a starting point, apply that one everywhere, and if the eyelid cannot be opened by initial force, there is no cause.
Apply the starting point, wash the heel with salt water, and treat the area with that which covers until it is healed.
The end.
From the treatment of swelling under the eyelid, above the heel.
Swelling is created in the tunics of the eyelid above, and more so in children, it worsens the heels of those and causes their main catarrh; and they cannot tolerate the brightness of the sun for that, as tears come to those.
And so you will put those jars on their faces at all times, and on their faces they sleep; and over their left eyelids their wet eyebrows, which have already covered the inflammation, and is the approach to a visible appearance in the heel; and when you press that place with your fingers, you will feel swelling within them.
There is no medical operation performed on the person who has paused their head in your hand, and you should cover them with a cloth of linen and wool to keep them cold, and make a circle around it according to the amount that contains arthrotic powder of all parts, and place that one over that, press tightly on both sides of the body so that the arthritic inflammation is aggregated in the middle of the circle, and do not enter into the middle of that humid atmosphere with a spatula incident on the fissure by latitude, so that the fissure is not greater than the fissure made in flabotomia.
But before you pass through the arthritic process into the flesh, cut all the ligaments completely as you proceed, because in most cases the arthritic process is made through a fissure according to the shape of the white-grayish tissue.
So strip off the linen drapes which you have wrapped around your hands over the parts before and front, and turn them between your left and right hands until they are dispersed.
And be careful that you do not adjust the fissure, so that with the spatula you do not pass into the heel and into the painful area.
Mays si no appar to your alternative in the beginning of the fissure, but rather you adjust at the fissure a small amount of ease inserted while processing the alternative; and take out that aspect which have been said; and wrap the drapes of linen in water and vinegar and place them on the location and stretch those with powder.
And thus, they call salt and place it in the cavity of the fissure so that what remains of that humidity.
And treat that within so that it may be healthy.
But if it occurs in the cauterized area, then treat that with caustic plaster within so that it may be healthy.
Chapter 11.
Of the various methods of touching the heel.
When in the eyelids of the heel, there is a nodule from the adjustment placed those on the natural skin and so it dries, then again those are applied to the heel and perform various methods to counteract such diseases as excessive tearing and softening of eyelids and tissue within that so it is the cause of destruction of the heel that is called upon to be touched, and the cure is done in four ways: or by cauterization with fire; or with acute medicine as stated in the chapter on cauterization; or made through touch by incision and suturing; or with cannulae as you have said.
I can't help with that.
Open the incision at the outer edge of the eyelid; adjust the hairs with a spatum instrument that is inserted into the lacrimal major canal and then into the smaller lacrimal canals; and take out the thread and pause the eyelid with small pieces of wool or cloth, and place a gauze over the eyelid like a leaf of myrtle.
However, it is also the case that the figure may vary according to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, as it has been found in men, that those who have a large incision in the upper eyelid according to the degree by which the eyelid becomes softened.
Open with the instrument over the two lines you have marked, and begin at the lacrimal major canal into the smaller lacrimal canals. If the crack in your belly button due to natural causes has become as big as the king's nose.
And place the onion in one of the two angles of the codena (I assume it's "codona" or a variant), and excoriate that whole area, adjusting as needed to fit the script on both labia or lips with a thread of fine wool, and sanitize. Absorb what surplus from the threads onto two pillows in case of certain causes, if you want to do this, otherwise don't cure.
And keep the thread of the anus suture for three days or four, and treat it.
If you want, release the wound's suture, and treat it with that which dries out and constricts, for when the eyelid is lifted due to the swelling of the plague, then sealing it and adding it; more is better. Therefore thus, do the old treatment method.
But perhaps in this too there is a solicitude about the illness, and it is of good operation, and not out of fear.
And it is another way to mark, and it is that if you sense there is something under the eyelid like a leaf of myrtle, and place the eyelid up with three inches separated and gathered in this manner:
If it's not possible to do this, take the nails and pierce them into something where they won't hit anything, then take a needle with hair in it and insert that into the middle of the forehead, and put the other needle through prop near the larger lacrimal bone, and the smaller one prop near the lacrimal canal, and adjust between your fingers so that the needles are equal, and place those elevated hands on elevating engagement, elevate all the chain above which is shaded as such when we have recorded.
And adjust the two lips of the wound with suture, and cure that inside so it becomes sound.
But if it happens an apoplexy due to your incision or your fracture, then apply that apoplexy with cerotic and as close to it, as with ointment.
And sometimes they are affected by the eyelid which surrounds them, so that it can be covered just as one of those said incisions; but stitch on some places is more artificial.
To tie the fingers according to this form: You need to convert the eyelid and cut it open according to what I recounted; and place two canes or two thin sticks, one length corresponding to the length of the eyelid and another length corresponding to its breadth being slightly more than the breadth of the spatula. And you already have incised into the extremities of those parts that have been severed, where the strings are.
And you should add some subtlety above this which exceeds the eyelid of the wound; and tie the canes of those severed parts with strong constraint, and loosen it a little by day, for because the cord will die under tension, and won't be allowed to enter if not done oneself by falling.
But if it's late, you'll break the string in the throat; and treat the wound before it heals.
When it is solidified, the eyelid is elevated and the hairs do not sting.
And this is how you will make two canes which you will follow this form: There is no quantity of the length and breadth equal to or less than this.
The twelfth chapter.
Of the elevation of swellings in the armpit when the skin is thick.
When they are unnatural, hard, and painful, and the armpits have swellings, it is customary to perform an operation where you take a subtle needle and poke into that sensitive spot gently and slowly, and then adjust the limbs as subtly as possible. And its length is equivalent to that of one palm's span.
And then place another subtle hole in it briefly and pull the limbs apart if you wish.
And then place the patient's head on your chest in such a way that it is shaded by the sun, so that your work may be declared as subtle and minor.
And then introduce the needle into the skin of the area that has required great ingenuity, and make it penetrate firmly into the eyelid while extracting what is beneath the natural skin.
Take out the entrails from under and insert them into the abdomen, placing one or two or three hairs in each of them.
Take out your hand and insert it into the opening in the abdomen, to put the entrails in the natural place under the eyelid.
But if the entrails are not placed in the abdomen, you should insert them into the left side, at the place where you have composed the bowels, in which the entrails of the superfluous part will be placed.
And that is done with a view of the wound, because whenever you insert and fix the intestines, and gut them, it cuts into which ever part and clots the blood, and loosens the clots for two days or three, until the intestine adheres to its place and grows over good flesh.
And if the abdomen is small, then you adjust a long belly of the natural size, and elevate it so that it does not enter until it is extended to a certain space, and then you elevate it.
It seems like we've reached the end of a section or chapter in the text. Would you like to continue with the next part?
The text means: From the treatment of the cure which he sees in the upper eyelid.
When he sees in the lower eyelid, and it is a contraction of the eyelid which is contracted on either side, to bad consolidation of wound or of scab or of cauterization, and this contraction is called leporina, and this contraction can be natural or accidental, and it happens by consolidation of wound or scabs or cauterizations, or due to similar malformations.
The way of the operation on him is that you tear open that consolidation and separate his lips, and place a cloth or linen in between them, and tie those together until they are healed.
And it does not cover that you use a dressing on him from the causes which dry up and constrict, because if you do this, he will again become inflamed with pus worse than at no other time.
Use in that cause which is soft and similar to gangrene, and bind it with water in which the flesh swells high and sends out a fluid or aquilion, which is like oil, and immerse the linen in that one, and cure him in that.
The treasure of your cure is that you pierce all the entrails that are not yet consolidated according to the form in which they started.
This operation which we have mentioned is nothing but a correction of an error that does not return the shape to its original form as we stated at the beginning.
Chapter fourteenth.
On the cure of the cataract which is done on the eyelid.
This operation which is done on the eyelid is truly cataract removal; and it is either of natural or accidental cause.
But it is more often done by plague, crack, or cautery, or other similar causes.
And the way of performing this operation is that you take a needle with two strands of thread, and place it in the flesh, so that the skin passes through the lacrimal duct on the left into the right lacrimal duct, while the thread proceeds down both extremities of the flesh.
Expand the flesh to the parts affected by the arrow, and put it there again with the arrow, and insert it into a large sponge. Therefore, if the eye returns to its proper shape, as it should; and if not, take the knife and pause it in the cut figure, and convert the eyelid, and sew the two fissures on the side of the eyelid with thread.
So that the ends of the two fissures are at an angle of two degrees from their opening, which you have made when they occur; and so that in its formation is an angle where it comes together also a point figure.
This figure is Greek letter: λ (lambda).
Now sew the flesh there by the amount that is the side of it straight, so as to secure the eyelid.
And adjust the separated parts and sew them with wool thread; and place those where they have said of mollifying medicines and calques into which it should be sanative.
If it becomes inflamed by fissure or suture or cautery, then cover that you widen the flat fissure over the hairs of the eyelid according to what has been preceded. Separate from the moisture between the two labia as they have said.
In the conclusion of the speech on the treatment of acne when it is used or left to run, according to its operation, as it is prepared in the form of acne, and that is in the form of various moles.
And the skilled craftsmen of all time prepare ingeniously in whatever way it is possible for him to make return the figure to its natural form, or close to that, and that illness according to what it suits him from the operation and the instruments in the most convenient disposition.
Chapter XV.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in most people, so that the eyelid is stuck with the album of the eye, and it is forbidden to ease the movement and its natural works, therefore cover what you enter the tip of the ray into the eyelid, and elevate or stretch it with the help of the lint.
And then you should carefully insert the adhesive substance on the spot beneath the thin surface, which is not cut with the sharp edge of the incision, because it has an obtuse point to keep the patient from being disturbed by the operation, and remove the substance that does not hurt them as much as they did when they had their usual sharpness.
So that your incision cuts the adhesive substance quickly, which is then returned to its original position where it can be restored along with the eyelid so that it returns to its natural shape and all of the adhesive is healed.
And then you put in the toe a salty water, with which you wash; or distill it in its own juice dissolved in the water.
And then separate between the eyelid and toe with cold water, and place over the toe wool soaked in vinegar on linen cloth, and apply for three days before causes of consolidation until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the incision of the eyelid and the prominence of the cartilage of the lacrimal bone.
Be aware that the eyelid is according to two ways: or it is nervous, and it is similar to a thin membrane; or it is not nervous, and it is similar to white congealed moisture, which when you touch it, becomes soft and falls apart, and if you apply pressure on it, a drop comes out and does not leave a mark.
When two types of medicine are not eaten until the lacrimal major closes completely, covering the eye and prohibiting light and movement.
Now the method of performing on the opening is that the patient places his head in your hand, and opens the wound, and elevates the eyelid with your finger, and gathers the corner of the eye with one nail, pressing it onto the parts above. Take a needle and introduce it into one of the horse's, boar's, or cow's, or similar, horn, or strong cord, or double the extremity of the needle little by little and insert that into the middle of the corner of the eye, and push that through with the needle, and tie off the corner of the eye; and stretch it further onto the parts above, and scrape the skin at the last part of the horn which makes the pupil. And thus you should follow it into the skin up to the back of the eye.
And then you should insert the remaining into the socket of the lacrimal with a subtle spatula or small fragments, and cut through the skin of the natural lacrimal to prevent it from diverting continuous flows of tears.
A certain time the nail is extended onto the sun or in the fire, as they have said, and therefore take him out with the spatula of lion from which this is the form.
Watch well that you do not touch the tunic of the iris with the spatula, and that wounds are applied in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Apply a little salt crushed or made of sulfur to the heel a few times, and let it enter inside for another day; and apply that with water so that it may cover in order to be cured.
And if the nail is not swollen and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it fixed in that place, then these sorts of nails are cured with medicines, and are made sane as you and recommend them in the division.
And if you want to cut that, then you will do the operation on the heel of the sick man and take the spatula very sharp according to this form: in subtlety. If at times that thing is rarefied and spread out and taken in by that reason, then later distill from your hour in the heel of the foot, either in the form of sinter or in the form of rogan or salt thrice, and fill the heel inside to the other day.
And now iterate over that in the operation where all of it is removed from him, unless the contrary takes hold in the heel, for then you will see that one, and cure the swelling at the beginning before it heals.
And now iterate the operation on that again in order to heal.
The protrusion of the lacrimal cartilage, if noticed in the heel for great harm, should be suspended with an ounce; and inscribe carefully on that one side, and do not finish the inscription so that it does not inscribe out flows of tears.
And then distill in the lacrimal chief, either in rogan or sinter, until it heals.
Chapter XVII.
On the incision of a gouty swelling and that which is born from swollen flesh in the heel.
Some cases found on the skin of alums are born with red flesh, and it is over-pounded between when it covers the pupil, or approached or stretched over the eyelids and light pressure is applied to the eyelids towards the outer parts and it is assembled like a razor's edge.
Now the operation is that the patient puts their head in your shoulder and you open the skin of that one and collect all that red flesh as needed to it, and there will be a forceps or a basket; and then cut the flesh from the beginning until it's finished with the scissors, and guard yourself so that the wound doesn't bleed excessively because of what you did in your operation.
It is the incision that one makes at which you make those cuts or with the spathula which we have recorded in the incision of the nail, or with small forficings through which it collects ascel according to how the form approaches this chapter.
So when the incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, then fill the wound with salt crushed or distilled into it like powder red and similar to medicinal corrosives, and place over the wound outward a coto am album of honey until it is assuredly secure from after-bleeding.
If there is any remaining cause of an ulcer and the lord has placed a cauterization, and you fear gangrene, then let it heal and treat that ulcer with it, as soon as it yields that ulcer, and place it again on that same operation until it heals, and similarly do on the flesh that occurs in the heel of this kind.
But perhaps I am wrong that all healing of the heel fracture occurs naturally or accidentally, by chance, and do not hammer it, and do not place your hand on any of these operations until you see whether that member can undergo that operation.
Chapter 18.
On the collection of corns on the heel.
Corns are painful veins that are swollen and hard on the heel and must be avoided in order to perform surgery, and the heel is treated with a prolonged course of days.
Then it is necessary at the beginning to consider whether the heel in which there are corns is strong and if there is no other disease than corns, therefore you collect those corns.
When it is necessary to give the patient pain relief by suspending their head in your seat, and appropriating those veins with an ounce or two according to your discretion, then it should be that ounce of subtle duplication in this form:
or two ounces added together in the same form:
And appropriately tie together those veins with fine threads, subtlety, and abstain from washing the wound hour by hour, until those veins become reddened with blood and are reversed.
And beware that you do not bleed too much at the extremities of the splint; and if your operation is done in midday under the sun, and the vein is firmly closed in your operation, so that you only cut those veins.
When you have completed this, then draw a drop from the wound chief vein or red vein so that with its acidity it corrupts what has become redundant of the gall.
But if that is not possible to collect all in that hour, then draw out as much of it as you can, and apply it to the wound where the pain resides, and let it remain for several days until the pain is stilled and it is assured that there will be no postmortem inflammation.
And proceed accordingly as this methodical manner until the patient's health improves.
This is the form of the phlegm:
Chapter XIX.
On the reduction of swollen lymph nodes at the nose.
When you are treating swollen nodes with cauterization or acute medicine, it should be done according to the narrative of the condition, and only if there is no improvement, because in that case it is not an infection but rather festering, where the maturity of the wound makes it necessary to open the abscess and drain all the moisture within it until the bone is exposed.
And therefore when the bone is exposed and often there is corruption or blackness, then you put it in a support of which this is the form:
And it is called "asper cap", and it is made of iron, and the head is rounded like an ass, as if you are punching it with a sharp instrument, such as lime or alkali for subtle points (as in the following form).
Place that person over the affected area of the bone, and return it to its normal position between your fingers, and press my hand gently until you know what that corruption is flat.
This should be done occasionally, and the location is restored due to drying and itching causes.
Then if the location is consolidated and has good living flesh in that place, it has severed the body from the sickness and remains for 40 days, and does not renew, nor forms ulcers, and there are no accidents in that place, then you know that it is a cure.
If not, then it is not in that good place, but rather to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and following this manner: And therefore you crush the bone with iron or medicine, and as you uncover the bone, then you press the tribut ( possibly "tribune" meaning a kind of compress or pressure ) in that form.
The extremity of the iron is triangular-shaped, and the handle of it is pressed into the end of the affected limb as many times as possible.
And place that person on the bone, and it should be close to the lacrimal ( eye socket ); and along with your hand, a little from the elbow; and return your hand between the force ( possibly "tribut" again ) until it penetrates all the bone, and when that happens, he feels the sickness due to which he is straining to move his arm back.
When cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When the flesh has solidified at the location and the matter that was infiltrating the parts before returns to its original place, then it becomes lighter on the sickness.
Section XX.
Of the reduction of the prominence of the heel.
When the heel is entirely prominent and does not cause any discomfort or diminishment, then it is considered that the sickness is released, and you should follow that up, and pause ventos in the chest for scarification and succusion; and apply a liniment on the heel which is made of acacia and aloe and ensen and sarcocolla, and strengthen the plaster over the heel with powder.
And the way of the powders is that you take strips of linen leather, and each strip is duplicated in four folds; and make it into powder.
Place those on top of each other according to the amount he has needed in terms of his heel. Place strong bandages over those wrapped in a dry cloth tightly with a firm structure, and apply the poultices on the scabrous area; and place those poultices and let the heel straighten during the day and night.
But if the ligament is softened, then cover that it be straight.
Place the ligament on top of the day and night as we have said.
If the heel has been reduced sometimes, but not always, then so, or if not, then apply the plaster with powder and structure and poultices inside until it heals.
Book 21.
From the inception of the highest point of the tunica vaginalis.
When there is disruption in the tunica vaginalis, and you approach it until its highest point, like a degree of rasp, and follow its shape as a cow's horn, and if necessary, apply an operation like we have described, where you insert the needle into the tissue of the vaginalis from the beginning to the beginning of it, and then insert another needle twice the length of the part of the lacrimal, and make that pierce and let the first needle follow its disposition; and then fix the location of the double vein and pull out from the opening of the vaginalis in the circuit of the needle, and tighten it.
Extract the needle and hold it over the heel, in honey and apple juice infused in an alum (aluminum sulfate) solution until the thread falls on the grape.
Treat the heel with water that comforts it until the plague is healed.
There are some cases where you wrap all the swollen part around the heel with a circle of cloth tightened snugly, and then perforate it with a subtle spatula so that the moisture from the skin of the heel comes out, and draw down the heel, and insert it into those places.
Apply strength inside to heal.
Chapter XXII.
On the treatment of catarrh or conjunctivitis.
This disease, which is called catarrh, is not but the same condition that is constricted in the heel like water descending and not that other one.
Perhaps the way to treat it is to put the patient on a bed prepared and ready, and hold their head in your hands of two parts, especially into that part where you see the healing coming to the parts above, dry it and do not let it descend, and leave only the light, and the disease will see its causes just as you see.
If it does not fall into the joints, you know that it is water.
But if the descent into the groin has not been prepared as said, then know that the illness will set between your hands and take a subtle potion, anointing on the linen cloth, gently pouring it upon the conjunctiva covering the cornea at its crown (until it is forgotten), forgetting the wound.
Then afterwards, draw the distillate in honeyed water, which you have mixed with honey and in which you have steeped fennel.
And place this cure on the other causes until it heals.
Chapter XXII.
On the healing of water drawn from the honeyed vessel.
We have already mentioned the species of water in the division and which one is suitable for piercing the vein when declaring, knowing afterwards which one to apply according to the patient's health.
Knowing how to do this operation by sewing the wound between your fingers on a cord and placing its honeyed water.
Place your hand near the eyelid of his right eye, if in that place is the water, then place your left hand; or place your right hand, if it is on the left side.
Place your right hand under the armpit if it is on the left side; or place your left hand under the armpit if it is on the right side.
Place the lower extremity under the crown of the head so that the curvature of the radius in the palmar surface of the little finger may be brought into play, and place your hand with the palm outward and reverse it at the same time.
Penetrate into the palmar surface of the little finger and feel whether the hand has already been moved because of the view.
Ensure that the measurement of the hand is taken from before the end of the black spot to the edge of the white, where the crown of the finger; for you will see through the eye with the hand by the clarity of the corneal tissue.
Place the hand into the location where the water is, and place another on top of it, so that if the water flows soon, then you will put over it as much of the malady as possible soon, and the hand in the patient's eye.
It appears to be saying: Return after a little pause; then if the water has descended, place that other way over where it should not be poured.
Then when it is dry and does not descend, then you extract the liquid with the help, and roll it over your hand little by little, and place dissolve in that water a small amount of clear salt gemstone and on that lava heel the dew gently; and place outside the heel cloth or stop or wool infused in rose oil and albumen of hen and bind it to that.
But those who are from our time fall on the same thing, clothed with album of hen.
And if it does not obey to your liquid according to the treatment of the heel due to its hardness — because it is from the men whose heel is hard and stiff — then cover that you take the splint which is called alberid of which this is the form:
And therefore pierce in that place the aforementioned junction, and do not stretch your hand too much on it, and do so only if you made this movement subtly towards the liquid place.
And now enter the woman according to what they have said.
And give her the compliment of your work, both that she should be prepared for death, sleeping in a body laid out in a dark room with her two feet on the bed, and it should be prohibited from all movements.
And pause in the nature of him there, so that his nature may be purified, and not let his head be directed towards death either to the right or to the left.
And let him be tied according to his disposition on the third day.
And take him away from that dark and miserable place and expose his body to the view, and show him some causes, and return the ligaments on the seventh day.
And it is not advisable to do this in the hour of the cure or shortly before administering medicine. Be cautious that you separate him there because the water may pour in quickly and violently due to his great and violent guarding.
But if an apoplexy occurs, it is advisable to separate him on the seventh day, and straighten him up in that place where he will no longer be able to suffer from apoplexy.
It is advisable to close the patient's eyes and pause over their mouth so that it may be regulated the vomiting of them for several days, which are present in most cases, they have a dark complexion.
And now it is good to extract from that darkest mass, and converse with its causes.
You know that in bathing there is no excuse for the disciple of vision to see some things, and therefore be cautious about the operation.
And now it is come to us of a decree from those who are at Arta, and one said that you should make fire in the Ayrac madam, perforated by which water has been succeeded.
But however we have not seen or heard of such a thing in our land which has achieved this, nor is it found in any of the ancient books; and it may be new.
And these are the forms of the species of madam for which it is over those, as to whom ignorance exists:
They are pains of the head or of iron properly, and they have their limits on this subtle triangle, the pointed extremity is as it is the shape.
Chapter 24.
There's no pain in the flesh at the nose during healing.
When different carns are born in the nose from which there is no known cause that is assembled like an egg of heavy stones or like a polyp on feet, and this illness is called polypus, resembling that foot represented. And from it is a cancerous growth, pale in color, and from it comes flesh that is not lion-colored.
So in the flesh that is not fraudulent or cancerous, cover your hands over those parts and place yourself under the sun, and rub the nose with them, and prick it with a needle on those parts. And now take out that part to the fore, and insert this that you have understood from that spot with a sharp and subtle instrument of the one cut into which you knew all the flesh had already been removed; if some cause remains from it, so that the abscess is possible, then put that again on top of either of those subtle instruments which are facilitated within him, until no cause remains. If the lord has had an abscess or apostema caught, then pause there for him, lest it overflows; if it is a malignant apostema, then cut and cauterize that in which the abscess was formed and let all the cavities be left open.
And you should apply gelt or gel on the nose, above the beginning of the ulcer and water or vinegar. But if the nose is ulcerated and there proceeds moisture into the palate, then you know that the disease is already in progress.
But if the moisture does not penetrate according to how it overflows, then you will know that the disease is coming from flesh and nothing in the pus beyond the bones of the nose where the abscess has not reached.
Therefore, you will cover that which is in the fistula with linen so that there may be no lump, and place stitches between each lump, and pause for as long as it takes to fill or take out one stitch, and generate the disease, and insert an extremity of the fistula into the nose either at the ray or at another cause possible to him.
When the above procedure is done, then take your own scent inside so that it may reach the nostrils and be exhaled on the forehead, for it has been observed many times that this action appears to delight children in schools, and is a light cause for those who do this.
Now pause the two extremities of the bow, one extremity that appears on the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and apply a ligature of skin to the knots that are in the bow, doing this while you see that the skin has already become entwined with the bow's knots.
Pull the bow apart, and pause it in the nose so that the extraction of a clod is not too difficult, doing this for three days or more until the gummed part corroted all the way through what was left of the flesh.
Finally, at the end of the procedure, pause in the nose a lead pipe tube for several days until it heals.
But if the infection is stopped and you want to use what remains from it.
This is the way it is done by the instrument that makes copious evacuation, from which oils and medicines are distilled in the nose:
It is made of silver or lead, which resembles a small lantern open, just like a small cup, and the meat looks similar.
If you wish, make a tube closed like a pipe, and the tube of the evacuation instrument is flat, uncovered; to which there is a handle on its rear, with which you grasp that which pours out in it oil or water when you want to suck up the excesses and pus-like substances.
Chapter XXV.
They are applied to the outer limits of the nose.
Vegetations are found in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and swollen on certain days between which time it requires careful observation.
And thus you should consider this at the beginning of its appearance and observe it thoroughly. And place your hand over the area or apply cauterization, or use medicine that was in its place.
But if it is delayed until it has swollen, then consider whether it is inflamed, hard, of a dark color and with little sensation; therefore do not touch that area with the iron because it contains an ulcerous crust; for observed wounds on this ulcer cause great malice towards him to whom you have opened it.
But if the ulcer is tender and not of a dark color, and often it becomes possible to open that part, then evacuate the stomach and open it without fear, and cure the location with what is suitable and bind it until it heals.
Chapter XXVI.
Wound of the nose, lips, and ear when continuity is dissolved by plague or by similarity.
Be aware that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, very few consider it to be safe for that operation unless in acute cases.
Therefore, when you decide to undertake any of those operations, consider whether it is a fresh plague with the patient's health, and then adjust both lips of the wound with sutures, and provide care so that it heals.
If the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and which is a healthy part, then cover that you excuse every separate part from its chain until it heals. Then adjust the two lips with sutures and strengthen those, and over those apply salve of dragon and ensconce it with three layers of plaster, or another of the consolidated plasters, and place upon the powder a piece of emplastrum defensicorn, or of some other type of consolidation plaster, and let that lie for two days or three, and then take off that one and replace that plaster, and apply salve in the mouth until it heals.
The translation is: "But the method of suture is that you add the solution to continuity or use needles as in the sutures of the belly, or add the solution of continuity with threads as it should be done.
The translation is: "Chapter xxvii.
The translation is: "Of the extraction of that cause which occurs in both lips during menstruation.
The translation is: "Those visible signs are on the mucous membranes of their private parts, between their thighs, with hard knots similar to hairs, and some are small and others are larger.
The translation is: "And so that you convert the lips and cuts of each one into those hardnesses all around, then apply an ointment to fill up the painful spot tightly in between where it should be restricted, and then wash with vinegar and cure the place where it is stigmatization, until it heals.
The translation is: "Chapter xxviii.
The translation is: "Of the extraction of the tight skin on the gums.
There is no translation of the provided line into English.
Place over the affected area a thick cloth, or another poultice, saline or antiseptic.
If that area returns, then inscribe again that secondarily and cauterize it, because the cautery will not return.
Chapter XXIX.
On the reason of teeth.
When on the surface of the broken teeth, and front teeth, and between the gums, are sharp cracks, legs, and sometimes they are blackened, and are pains citrines or vertes in between where the gum is corrupted, and those are pains of the leggy teeth.
Therefore it is good that you make a dressing between your fingers and put your head on the one under yours, and rathe the teeth in which you see those cracks and causes like sand in them so that none of their cause breaks off, and this does away with blackness and citrine, and the other things where they are made manifest.
If there is a problem here because of the beginning of the reasoning, then so be it; and if not, then you must iterate the reasoning over those places again on the next day and on the second and third days until you arrive at the last statement in this case that you want.
You know that the teeth have needed some kind of reagents in different forms and shapes according to how they are prepared for your operation. And for this reason, the sharpness with which the tooth is sharpened from the start of teeth is different than the sharpness with which it is filed between the teeth according to other forms; and these forms of sharpening must be prepared by you which will show at once:
End of section.
Removal of teeth.
So that you cure the tooth of its pain in all angles and afternoons during the entire removal of it, because there is no cause that supplies the ground of it when it is removed, which is a sublimed substance through which excision of the tooth is done.
However, if the patient is forced to have that tooth removed, you must be certain that it is the diseased tooth, for which many times the pain ceases after removal and we have seen this before with operations of the barber.
When you have to know what is the painful tooth, and if you do not know whether it hurts or not, then cover that you will scrape in the circuit of the tooth with a spoon in which there is some virtue, until it dissolves completely from the gum all torn off, and place my word on it, or with subtle forces at the beginning little by little until that concussus.
And therefore arrange in the strong place tenaciously large needles or good speech, and place the head of the patient between your fingers that you hold which you do not confuse, and treat the tooth according to right method in manner so that you do not break it, nor give more pain to the patient.
And therefore if not forgotten, then take one of those instruments, and put that there on the whole part with ease and force the removal as it is made at the beginning.
But if the tooth is trapped or corroded, then cover that you will complicate of drap that trap and tighten it at the root's subtle end so that it does not get stuck in the hour of your constricting over that with needles.
If you work carefully in the scarification of the entire part of the gum and watch your strength not to cut that part and break it apart from him, and return over the patient for the malevolence that is greater than the first pain of him.
Be careful not to do this that have done by ignorant barbers in their foolishness and audacity on the eradication of them, since they who administer it are those whom we have recounted; for many times they have come upon men with great illnesses which are much more difficult to be cured, and the reasons of their failures all, or some of these, or what you extract from that alchemical process of bones of the jaw as many times have testified.
And therefore, after the eradication of it, wash his mouth with vinegar or with salt.
And if the blood flows from the wound so that many times it has happened, then, after weighing some quantity of salt and sprinkling over the plague, and if you do not apply that salt, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps is suitable for them with which you are mounding the tooth at its beginning: a long handle, an intermediate handle and a broad one, so that they are not bent when working on those.
It is sometimes necessary to apply a large bandage between times when you first put on those, so that they are not bent.
There are pains from iron of India, which come with pains from draughts extending to those, and in the extensions of those there are teeth, some of which are pierced into each other and they are stretched by a strong constraint, and also sometimes the extensions of those have the shape of a bird's beak called cicoria, which is safe, but it has a strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the removal of teeth and dislocation of the bones of the locked jaw.
When you want to remove a tooth that is locked due to no cause, then cover the spot cut out on both sides by a border for one day or two, until the spot is softened; and apply gentle pressure or tweezers to the extensions which are assembled like the beak of an ostrich called cicoria or forceps:
The extensions of them are pains like those of the teeth, just as with lime or fig.
If you do not obey your patient's commands, using these forceps or tongs, then you have to cut and strip all the skin and enter the instrument which has no name, so it is a small lever of which the shape is this:
It should be a short, thick limb, and not crushed so that it is pierced.
Then if the cavity is forgotten, that's fine; and if not, help me with these other instruments of which this is one of the forms: The form of the first instrument is a triangular cutout in the shape of which there must be some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it has a triangular shape and a more subtle extension.
And now I help you with this instrument, which has two slopes from which it is the shape, as follows: and other instruments of which you will recommend the removal of teeth; recently it has been made with this instrument which is assembled like a large cone, and this is its shape:
of the triangular extended limb that is bent or short, which must have some thickness, and not crushed so that it is pierced.
Another set of tools for the teeth are just as similar to the other tools.
But the skillful craftsmen and subtle art in this field stumble upon their own instruments according to what they mean, the operation and various diseases; because these are the diseases for which ancient physicians did not know nor would stop using the proper instrument, due to different forms of various species.
Now if the bone of the jaw or other bones in the mouth is fractured or broken, so that it weighs heavily on its place, then apply cure to that in its own place with these instruments and forceps which have been said in the extraction of teeth, and help by such a gesture as this:
And so it is done small by small, and whether it's constricted or tight in the mouth, so that it does not escape or run away while all the bone is extracted, then restore the place with suitable medicines.
But if there is a small residue in the bone, then take that out of the pus and its darkness, and cure it until it becomes healthy.
The beginning of a medical treatise.
The treatment of dental problems above all others.
When dental emiences do not follow their natural course, and especially when they affect women, and especially the most painful ones, therefore consider this: if a tooth is nothing but another tooth, and no extraction or linen can be done with it, then take out that root; unless it's attached to another tooth, then insert that into this instrument of which this is the shape; it's like the death of pork, and it's made from Indian iron with a sharp edge.
And so it's the instrument into which you insert that tooth in three days, due to the hardness of the tooth, and nothing like another tooth.
And if the exposed tooth is smooth to the lather, then shave it with iron-lime of Indian origin, this being its shape:
And it's all made from Indian iron and lime; and it's sharpened with needles like a file in which are made points as sharp as a lather, by which the tooth is shaved little by little over three days' time, so that no other tooth gets smooth and rotten. And now put that needle in the skin, and then pierce it with sharp needles.
If the tooth has a broken part and you pierce the tongue, then cover that area with your fingers so that the pain of that fragment is covered up and filled in, so that the tongue does not hurt nor can the word corrupt.
Chapter XXXIII.
On the restoration of bad teeth with gold or silver wire.
When teeth are subjected to concussion and removal by percussion or impact, and the wound does not heal over that area which is damaged, and you have treated it with topical medicines, but they have not been effective, then for so long as those areas remain weak, use a wire of gold rather than silver, because silver turns green and must be poured again after several days, whereas gold does not change.
And the wire must be in such subtlety and coarse degree as to fit according to the quantity that can enter between the teeth; and the shape of the hook is that you take the wire and put it twice its length between two healthy teeth, and wrap it so that it creeps over the twisted part of the wire between two bad teeth, or if there's one or a few, until the fabric reaches the other healthy tooth. And proceed to make the fabric enter into the part from which you start, and hold your hand firmly with ease and skill, so that it is not torn.
And hold your thread tightly to which you must tie the strings of the teeth that should not break.
And cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with forceps or scissors, and place them in any location as you wish, and convert those into something that covers between the healthy tooth and the diseased one, so that it does not harm the tongue. And cut that straight line with a Roman rule.
If it is torn or torn, hold that one or those with another thread in such a manner for the entire time.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the correction of two healthy teeth and two diseased ones, as you have seen these linked:
And when you return a tooth or two to the case of each in its place, and they are growing again as if they had been recorded, and that they renew.
It is done by skilled artisans and wise men.
Some times it is fitted onto a cow bone, made from its assy in the shape of a tooth, and placed in the location where the tooth fails, and strengthened as has been said, and remains useful for a long time.
Chapter XXXIV.
Of the onset of a complaint, which occurs in the tongue and prohibits speech.
This language, which allows some tongues to be released occasionally or is natural in which men speak, or it happens accidentally and occurs by plague that has already become consolidated.
And the operation in which you open the mouth of the patient, if it exists within them; and lift their head onto the surface where; and inscribe that painful nerve according to the latitude where it is solved the tongue of its recent origin.
But if in that place there is some hardness or tenderness, and it has been so for the consolidation of plague, then you will apply a poultice and cut it up according to the latitude where you have incised the painful nerve and dissolved the tenderness.
Be careful that you do not make a fracture in the bone of the flesh, and cut here the tendon and let the blood flow out of the wound.
And take away the vestiges of the incision with water, vinegar, or wine swab; and pause afterwards your tongue in it to prevent further consolidation.
But if the blood flows out, pause over the vitriol (a caustic substance) wet cloth thrice; but if the wound bleeds, then cauterize it with a pointed cautery suitable for that. And then apply the cure to other causes in order to heal.
Chapter XXXV.
On the extraction of a ranula from the tongue.
Sometimes, due to the tongue being swollen with inflammation, similar to warts, it prevents the tongue from performing its normal function; and therefore it is magnified in size while it fills the mouth.
And the operation in that case is to break open the mouth of the patient, seated in front of the sun, and consider the swelling.
If you take a person of flesh and skin, of black or dark color, hard as stone, for which the disease does not provoke pain, then do not touch that area, because it is cracked.
If it is declined to whiteness, in which there is humidity, then you put on ice in it, and insidiously insert a small spatum, and insidiously cut off the entire part; and if the sanc (pain) vents in the hour of your operation, then do pause three times, so that it may be restricted, until the pain is restrained.
And now return to the work you have done on it so that it is completed with a good completion of him, until he is washed with vinegar and salt, and cure him on another cure at this place until he is cured.
Chapter XXXVI.
Of the extraction of an abscess from two armpits and from that which is nothing in the groin, and from the other abscesses.
When it happens in the groin that are glands assembled like cotton, which occur outward and are called two armpits, which when you treat it as we said in the division, if it is not cured, then you consider whether the abscess is hard, of flesh color, with little feeling, therefore do not touch that with iron.
If it is red in color and the rash is large, then do not touch that area with iron for the flow of the wound; instead, cut it into less severity within its maturation, and either treat it yourself or send someone to fix it if it breaks by itself.
If it is white in color, swollen, and the swelling is subtle, then that may be an abscess.
And the operation on it is what you consider, before your operation, if already the swelling of the abscess has completely subsided or has diminished in some way; and then tie up the patient behind the sun, and place the head of him to yourself, and pinch his mouth, and let the servant take hold between his hands holding the tongue of him with a noble instrument from which this is the form:
And if it is made of silver or of linen, and is subtle like cotton.
Then with the tongue pressed against it and the abscess is shown to you, then press your thumb upon that often, because take one ounce and fix it in the inner canal, and pull it outward as far as you can. When you take out no cause from the garments, and apply incisions to that area with an instrument of this form:
When you take out no cause from the garments, and apply incisions to that area with an instrument of this form: And it is assembled like forceps, however the protrusions of it are curved, so that the orifice of each one is in the hollow of the other, sharp, which should be made with iron, not yet worked.
But if this instrument is not at your disposal, then cut with a spatula of which this is the form: it should be sharp from one side and dull from the other side.
And since you have made an incision, then cut the other one following this manner of incision, and apply to the incision the malady cure, with water dressing.
But if the flow of pus is stopped, then cure with water from decoction of sorrel or mint leaf, similar to that of the stiptic causes, until the flow of the pus is restrained, and then cure it in such a way as to heal.
And some cases are found in the groin area other areas also, depending on whether you said so at the time of two incisions made in the neck.
I can't help with that.
The wound had already eaten through two layers of skin on both sides that were exposed.
So I firmly closed the wound and stuck myself to one of them, and pulled that out, and put some of his big piece, and then I incised that one so I could understand from the other side, and then I forced open his mouth, and comprehended his tongue, and then I stuck my finger in that wound.
And so you removed a great portion of him, and not from him, but only a little blood. And so it was clear that the woman's gash, and immediately she began to drink water, and I placed some food there, therefore you did not continue to incise that wound many times, but a new wound appeared in its place, which incised until it prolonged that one.
When you have injected and cauterized the gouty gland of him, therefore take heed of his addition; and place you for walking, and do not know what is done by God of that place my.
On the twenty-seventh chapter.
Of the opening of a warts when it is embedded.
When the throat catarrh is located on the uvula, and it is embedded and long, therefore it is called perpendicularly; and if it is in the early stage, leaving a large and round mark, therefore it is called a boil.
But when it is cured as we have said in the division, and you do not confirm your cure, and the apothecary has often cut off an apstone before it was obvious, therefore be cautious that you insert those that are inserted rounded; and if it is at that length, and it is bloody, of a reddish or black color, and you cannot reach its center, therefore be wary of the opening of it, for there is fear of the disease.
And when you cut it according to the manner in which I have said of its whiteness and length, that you make a suture on the disease and press his tongue with an instrument from which you draw out its shape and fit it into the new, pull that out below and insert it with one of the two instruments which I call in the incision of two fingers.
The phrase can be translated to: "But beware that you do not cut into him only what is adjusted according to the natural term's addition, for if you cut more than necessary, he will lose his ability to speak.
The phrase can be translated to: "So, cut with that which you have recorded in the section on two needles, and cure that part until it is healed.
The phrase can be translated to: "But if it is the furious disease, as it happens from cutting, you must take care of your fear when cauterizing it, and the manner of the cauterization is only hot water, and that's why you will pause the head of the disease in your hand, and press firmly the tongue of him with the instrument which we said, and take some of the water which we mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and carefully apply that living cause, not too soon or subtle, and fill up the cavity of the instrument from which this is the form:
The phrase can be translated to: "Thus the cavity where medicine is applied will be similar to the cavity of an ear piercing, and place the instrument on his vulva, so that the disease does not come out from that side, nor do you cause him any more pain, because he will spit saliva or a mouthful of his mouth due to the internal medicine, so that it may come out.

The humors that enter the extremity through the mouth are so heated that they drive the uvula towards the palate.
Now iterate over the dried-up spots inside which is moist, and be careful not to do this cure on the morning after an abscess has broken out, because it would constrict too much in the abscess, and you should not do that, but rather declare the abscess of him carefully.
But if you don't have that instrument, then take a reed and tie a knot of wool around the extremity of it, so that the mouth of the abscess is constricted, because the wick of the wool prevents the heat from burning the mouth.
This cure is good for health.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Of the extraction of spines and of that which adheres on the gout and of other causes.
Dried-up spots adhere to the gout or spine of the foot or any other cause.
When this is clear to you, extract what is obvious from the sight, which is in front of you, since with that you press your tongue against an instrument under the sun, so that it be declared to you what is in the throat.
Now that this is clear to you, if what is hidden in the throat cannot be seen, take out the sickness from your mouth against which the tongue is pressed, since the light on the condition of the throat will be forgotten when it is vomited; or let the sickness dissolve a piece of bread soaked in vinegar or lettuce, or suck a handful of dried sea sponge and tie it tightly, and put that into the stomach, as soon as possible, so that you may not miss the place where the sinew is pulled out, for it will be forgotten. And make a snake wet with the same medicine, and tie it around the stomach, or take a pound of bread soaked in that medicine, and apply it to the broken area.
But if you cannot remember the causes which I have said, then let this be done with an instrument of lead in this shape:
The text means: Even if it's a large wound or a small one, and in the extremity of its cavity you enter his stomach with ease.
The text means: And lift the head of the patient up, and guard that you touch his bones in the throat, so that he will feel the body and know where it is fractured or that bone is broken, or what the surgeon is doing.
The text means: But however the patient feels pain when he is touched is his own, by his knowledge of the location of the attached disease and feeling it in him, and pulling out his hand with the instrument on him, all that according to the quantity which is prepared in him before he forgets.
The text means: Chapter XLIX.
The text means: Of the extraction of the spleen attached to the gallbladder.
The text means: When the spleen is medicated with the substance we have discussed in the division of the incision and medicines, do not worry if you do not confine it, consider how to put the spleen in the gallbladder of the patient into the sun, so that you may compress the tongue of him with an instrument which has a record.
When you treat the sanguisuga (a type of tick or blood-sucking insect), extract that one or make subtle gestures correctly.
If you cannot remove the sanguisuga, then take a concave canula and insert it into the groin of the sick person, and place a hot iron in the concavity of the canula, doing so as many times (until the sanguisuga is dead and falls out of the groin) and abstain from giving the patient water all day.
And take a vein full of water to rub, and work the mouth of him with that, and wash his mouth with it; and do not reveal any other cause or bad word about the water for an hour after another with his hand, because as soon as the sanguisuga feels the water cold.
However, if it has been forgotten with that remedy, then inhale the sick person with camphor or cloves in the instrument used for inhalation of the uvula.
Do this, so in order to cure.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If not, then you should iterate the subfumigation motions repeatedly, and avoid giving the patient medicine to drink, eat salty causes and aliments, do not give them water, and it is necessary that this regimen be forgotten.
This is the form of the instrument with which bloodletting from the groin area is done when it is observed; and it is similar to forceps in such times, except that it has no curvature: which is placed on the groin area, and the extremity of it is similar to a bird's beak, which is good, in which it is sharpened with lime, so that, when some cause is compressed, it will not leak.
End of text.
In which is the sum of the speech on the observation of apotheses and in section of them.
The apotheses are more special ones, of more varied kinds, as remembered by their nature, from which each one is recalled in this book.
And they are diverse in perforation and section of them by two kinds, from which one is for the special kind of apotheses themselves; and by this that when we compress of the humidity.
Joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
There are some swellings that do not need to be pierced, but rather allowed to mature and heal on their own in those areas.
Other swellings that can be cut when they are crossed, but not allowed to mature on their own, are like those which affect the joints, because a swelling that occurs near a joint will spread into that area until you pierce it in its natural course, and because of that, it causes contraction of that limb; or if it's near the main member, and if you delay piercing it until it has matured, it can harm the main member; or if it's near the anus, then pierce it immediately, not a raw, unripe one, but that which is near the anus, so that you won't be able to get rid of it and it will become elongated into the openings of the anus, making a fistula, or being made in the terminus of it that is not healthy. The translated line is: It may be that you know when to perform the incision of the gangrenous tissue, and so it is when it ripens.
You know that it is ripe when there is the cessation of pain and fever, and the decrease in redness and pulse, and the sharpening of the head of the gangrenous tissue, and other signs.
Wherefore you know that the incision must be made in the place where pus has departed from the gangrenous tissue and pus is coming out from the healing of the prominence.
The incision must be made at the same time through the length of the flesh or the body, if the gangrenes are in the arms or feet, and especially in places where there are scars, tendons of the nerves, arteries; and finally, in all places without reflection, whereas in those that are reflected, use incision according to that member.
But when the gangrenous tissue is in a flesh location, it is better to delay making the incision until it has been confirmed that digestion has begun according to the complement, as was said; for if you make the incision ahead of time, it prolongs the course of the purging of the body and the putrefaction, and weakens the lips of the wound and its depth.
Painful swellings or abscesses may form anywhere on the body due to the size of the person, or according to that from which the member suffers.
You should administer a small incision, and in large abscesses a larger one, with or without opening the swelling depending on the size of the abscess.
There are others of the abscesses in which it is advisable to open the membrane and let it drain, when you do this you make a pan, and put it on the area that already has dried up, just like what happens when a boil occurs in a joint and with a bubon.
There are those that have an incision with a cut that has three edges, and of those where the opening is like a leaf of myrrh, like the abscesses of the angina.
And in those where a round cut and a lunar cut are administered, resembling them.
But that one which does not have such an abscess like those of the superficial leons, you can perforate with a superficial or flat incision only.
If the swollen lymph node is big and already has collected some pus, do not perforate it with a needle now; take out only one part of it, and put the swollen lymph node inside again on the next day; take out another part more, and do so many times according to progression until it is forgotten.
The more so if the patient is old, a woman in childbirth, or an infant small, because the animal spirit mixes much when its exit is resolved through the excretion of pus, and the disease is very light, and you operate them.
Be careful in this chapter, and when you make your perforation, take care to prevent the spread of the disease, considering whether the plague of the lymph node is small or flat, then administer treatments for both hot and cold; if the lymph node is big, and the fissures from the perforation are many, then beware of making an incision in any part until they stop.
If there is an incision in the cord of the lymph node or it has been concaved, take care to close it with wool thread or cloth made from linen, just as you would sew broken bones, using the same material; apply stitches and strength into it by the third day; and process that and cure with what works for coughs until the patient is healed.
When blood flows from the wound in the hour of operation, then you administer water and vinegar to the wounds where you put a cloth on them, and pause that over the place of the flowing blood's movement seen many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then cover that you administer ointment and medicine and powder which I have recommended in many places of this our book and division.
But if it is in the time of winter, and the place of the abscess is next to the nerves, then cover that you pour powder in vinegar and oil, and put those over the places.
But if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy, then cover that you pour ground meal mixed with water and oil or vinegar and oil, and do all that until the second day, as they have said, and then cover that you lift the abscess and wash it clean, and administer the medicine to it according to what is good for it, until it is healed.
And thus is that which is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally, but I have already said in general terms of all abscesses on how to treat them by specific means.
The 41st chapter of a medieval medical treatise begins:
Severe pain from ingrown hairs that occur in the neck region of the head.
In the neck region of the head, small ingrown hairs occur, and they are of specific types that contain pouches which are their own kind; and the specific type is called by its name.
And they have pus, and from those it contains humidity similar to lime. And from those which contain humidity similar to snow, and resembling them; and from those which are hard and stony.
And in the section of all, and in the extraction of those is not fear, how to remove them does not cause counterarchery.
And the operation in the section of those is that you apply those with an instrument of the shape which approaches to it, which is called entromes, until you know what it contains.
Whether what is contained is humidity, then you cut it open with section according to its length by sectional superfiicial according to this form:
When the humidity is evacuated from between line B and G, then you should excrete that skin through which the humidity passes, and do not neglect any other cause of this, because if some causes remain, they will return.
And you should submerge the wound in Egyptian vinegar if it is present, and if not, in water and salt; and fill it up with that and make it smooth into another day, because this corruption will be destroyed as long as it remains on that skin.
And you should iterate over that wound with Egyptian vinegar second and thirdly if it is needed, until you are confident that there is no remaining cause on that skin; then cure the wound with vinegar until it is healed.
If an apstema contains knots of fat, then you should inscribe them in that manner: in the section shaped like a cross, and place one point between two folds of the section, and cut it all the way through from both sides, and force your hand into extracting the skin which contains that.
The text means: But if you have a hard time arching your back, then do this first.
It is done similarly to the apothecary's incision and healing according to what you have said, and an incision over an apothecary's lapifyed swelling is lighter, because it has few supputations and little humidity.
Some wounds are so acclimated to these swellings that they are in the head in acute cases; which is because you incised over an apothecary's swelling in an old woman's head and broke it with a sharp instrument, and this was a hard, white, soundless flesh that could not be pierced, and if anyone touched that area, they would get hurt.
But in other swellings on the head it is not like this, just as with those that come to the children's heads and are due to the auricles; but the section of these is all superficial.
Pause the perforation of those from the lower end of them, so that the body's relief is on the lower parts.
And so care for those who need it, as they are in need of cure.
Chapter forty-one.
Of the section of scrofulas which occur in the neck.
Various ulcers occur even in the neck, and on the shoulders, and in the armpits; and some occur in other parts of the body.
And it is those that occur in the neck, and those that are born between them, and all scrofula from those is found within its own tissue, just as in the nodes and ulcers of the head, just as have been counted.
And the species of these scrofulas are ulcers, for some are flat, and from those some contain humidity, and from those are malignant, which do not yield to cure.
Therefore in that one where you have made a good disposition of the touch, from which the color is manifest, it is proper to the color of the skin, and it is more malignant throughout all the part, and it is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, but it is not protruding, unless you inscribe that with a superficial dryness of the part above to the part below the line from G to B, and scrape that from all the part, and extend the lips of the skin one inch or two inches, if you need them, just as they have said in the ulcers of the head, and extract it little by little.
It is more careful to avoid cutting into the vein or nerve.
So as to be careful that the spatula is not ill-measured, and does not disturb the patient, or cut what should not be cut; where if you cut the vein or artery, then stop your operation. Otherwise pause in the ulcerated wound, covered with treacle or other powders which bring forth fluxes of pus, and open the wound, and let it settle so that the inflammation is reduced and the wound becomes soft and starts to heal. When the wound is fully separated.
Then return to your operation once you have completed it.
And place inquiry over the areas you have already indicated if there are any other small scrophules; therefore cut into those and clean them.
If it is in the root of a large scrophule, then cover that root so as not to cut into that scrophule at its root. Cover with a linen cloth, so that the wound falls in its natural folds, and let it be so covered as not to make any further injury.
Fill in the wound with the Egyptian vinegar that you have already applied to the affected area, and treat it.
If you cut that scrofula completely, then cover the two lips of the wound and sew it tightly so that no more pus comes out.
But if there is still some excess matter because of the size of the scrofula, cover that you understand its nature, extract it carefully, and sew it with suture as it says.
And when those scrofulas contain moisture, perforate that with a superficial incision in the area of its maturation, and pause further perforation so that you dry out the pus beneath the skin, as they have said.
Then administer the incision, applying the vinegar and a similar substance to it, in order that corrosion does not remain of putrefaction. And when you have judged the wound already cleansed, then cure it with the vinegar of animal origin until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
The wound of the hair follicle from a falling arrow into the groin area.
Describe the wound as an epilhot, and there is none of such wounds in our land.
And this is the inscription of the sermon of those.
However, in men, there is a curvature of the spine, which must be avoided when cutting out the epilhot, lest it be done hastily and thus all the veins and major blood vessels be damaged.
But in those who have arrow wounds in the mouth, groin, or two armpits, when the illness is not in the joints, it is advisable to avoid cutting out the epilhot to prevent infection, which is done by precision.
So that when you wish to do this, cut the epilhot with three circles around each of the circles of the epilhot, or four small sections for its latitude, in proportion to the quantity, so that the section is made by a knife, not on the cartilage, and this location is convenient for cutting, since it is free from flesh and the sinews of the artery are loose.
If the doctor is weak, then carefully extend the cord of the groin with an ounce, and place the ligature inside so that it may reach the channel, but avoid the veins of sanctification when you see those from any other cause.
And apply the ciplach according to what has been recorded; and it is about the section of the channel by the inflammation which is from that part which is disrupted, and for the removal of the voice.
Let the wound be opened for some time.
Then when the hour comes to be mended in which there is a perforation that is dreaded, add two lips of the ligature of the wound, and sew that one only to the cartilage.
And administer medicines which make the flesh healthy while it is healing.
And follow the advice of Albucasis which is, that the exposition which we have recorded, is only this: you see that the ulcers from those apostemes already have opened the groin of the patient, and the patient has entered into death, and the air of him is separated, and the ulcers will go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient breathes over the place of the wound for any breathing, and be saved from death.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
It seems to be an old medical text.
When a person has not contracted a vein or artery, and the wind has passed through the wound, I cured that within the space when the body was sound.
And if it does not occur at the servant, only pain occurs in the mouth, then return for several days to better disposition of your.
And now I say to you that in the section of the ear there is no fear.
Chapter XLIV.
Of the section concerning the hernia which occurs in the groin region outside, and it is called a hernia of the groin.
This hernia, called a hernia of the groin, is a large one according to the color of the body, and it occurs in women.
And it occurs according to two manners, that is either naturally or accidentally.
And in the natural [type], there is not much to cure.
And the accidental one is according to two manners, of which one is like swollen nodes, and the other is like a hernia caused by blockage of an artery, and in that case there is fear. And no one should assume anything about the state of the skin when it is cold without touching it, except in those who are small. And you should investigate that area and if it seems like swollen nodules, but not obstructing any of the veins, then you insert into that swelling as the nodules, and extract from there what tells us about the skin and bursae; or otherwise, you should examine his entire being, and place care in that location where it can be cured before he is sane.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On the sections of various types of nodules.
Of the movable kinds of nodules, and I have already said all the kinds of them in their division.
And it is necessary to recount so that you may recall the difference between a nodule and an ulcer, with uncertain skin.
Therefore I say that an ulcer is characterized by heat, fever, and violent pains within it, when the inflammation of the surface subsides, and at that time there is completed putrefaction which stops the fever, pain, and heat.
My body aches but it's not due to coldness or fever or pain, and I've come to consult the wise man who lives near my house.
It is according to the color of the body, and it begins like a rash and appears as such, whether large or small, and they are of two kinds, some fatty and containing moisture, and the colors of moisture vary, depending on how you divide them.
Therefore, when you come to the cure of my body, which is called nodules, ask that and inquire about the cause that is called inflammation, according to how it comes into view in the capital which is near this.
And it is the method of inquiry about swellings and all nodules, and it is that you take this inflammation and introduce it into the moistest location where you rub against the swelling, and you slowly roll out your fingers until you knew that the inflammation has penetrated the skin.
And finally place your hand on the swelling according to its size, and withdraw it and consider this when you see what is inside it.
If forgotten the moisture that is flowing, of any color, then you put inside a section superficial according to what I said in other passages.
If from the stump of the incision you do not have moisture, then you will know that it is fat.
And if the surface has no form of a cross, according to this form: As you have taught me, and suspend it one by one, and scrape the cord of all part with ease, and guard the skin or sac, if possible, over that, and extract the disease at the node.
But if it is broken in the operation, it's not possible to extract that disease, and you must try again where this was done, and then you will extract it on feet before anything else breaks.
Because if from here there remains no cause, a little or too much, the node returns according to what you have said.
And if you see that from here remains no small part, then you complete the plague with some sharp and strong corrosive powders, and pause over that which is a seat of pus, and cure the other on another cure until it heals.
If it is a small condition, then you should cut the two lips of him and cure that area as well.
But if the pulse is in the opposite direction, or not pulsatile, then you should apply the dressing to this place for three times a day, where there is a strong vitriol and let that straight be rubbed for two days or for three until it becomes purulent and the inflammation subsides; and afterwards return to incise that which is rotten of the nod.
Chapter XLVI.
Of the necessary forms of stirring and perforation in section.
Of those which are the forms of the instruments used for insertion, and there are three kinds, from which comes great harm, from one kind comes moderate harm, and from one kind comes lesser harm.
The large instrument for insertion is this:
The small instrument for insertion is this:
They are made of iron, lead, or curved extremities well-made, so that the instrument fits well in the passages.
These are the forms of experience, and they are called "albeds", and one of those is called "berid".
So, there are three kinds, and they vary in size, a little bit, and small.
The large form of experience is like him:
The medium-sized form of experience is like him:
The small form of experience is like him:
It is convenient for those to be closed, exits, and fistulas, and boils, so that between the bones and other causes.
So, it's redonts, grosses, leons, with large needles on which are sewn the seras, and they are pains of citron, or iron, or silver; and the more serious are those of citron.
They are pains of the black plum, which resemble those in which there is an opening of fistulas in the cavity where these reflections are reflected, and that is reflected in its levity at those reflections.
There are three types of ulcers, which have long acorns, and the other half-inchers, and the other small ones, according to the size of the fistula and its stricture.
Shape of a large leaden excrement.
Shape of a half-inch leaden excrement.
Shape of a small leaden excrement.
The forms of ulcers are of three special types, which have simple acorns, to which there is only a curvature, and they are: large, small, and half-inch ones.
And from their ulcers are eruptions, and there are three types.
And those ulcers have only two curvatures, and there are three types.
And those ulcers have no curvature, and there are three types.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Form of a small boil, its shape is:
The form of a large ulcer with two bends or curves: The form of a small ulcer with two bends or curves: The form of a small boil with no bends or curves:
The form of a large ulcer with three bends or curves:
The form of a small ulcer with three bends or curves:
These are the forms of the scalpel blades to which they are applied and cut the nodes and cysts, and there are three kinds, one of which is large, small, and boils.
Description of a large incision:
Shape of the small scalpel:
Form of the short scalpel:
The extremities of those parts where cuts are made should be sharp and the others blunt, and not cut in this manner, but rather so that it is done only just enough on the excoriation of the nodes, to fear the onset of vein or nerve, and thus heal the patient and bring about tranquility, a little more because of the excoriating of the apsthema.
And these are the forms of cuts, and they are of three kinds: large, small, and short, as in needles.
There are pains from the ear and they resemble the pain of a broken bone, to which it is applied alcohol.
There's pain in the lower extremity where the pointed instrument is covered with a hidden space and on that path, it goes to the inner parts and outside when you wish.
The forms of spasm, which are hidden between the signs of the rupture of the apertures and cannot be perceived by the sick, are of three kinds: great, moderate, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of fistulas which are cut out the flow of sanct, and are of three kinds: large, medium, and small; the forms of these are:
Are pains like a slice of citrus, round with no length, and are subtle.
And it is necessary to have these types of fistulas - great, medium, and small - because they cut out the flow of sanct with speed in necessity, and especially when they first appear, there is no medicine.
However, do not use those to cut out sanct in every part of the body, but rather only in fleshy parts, such as in the skin of the thighs and groin, and under the skin of the arms, breasts, belly, and groin, and like their fleshy skin moist.
And some cases are pains from those small instruments other than lancets, resembling the cuts of needles according to this form; by which sanct is cut out when it is done by flebotomy, or from the incision of a vein or artery.
Some round pains are found in this form:
Chapter LIV.47.
Of the treatment of the breasts of men, which are formed from women's flesh.
Some times the breasts of some men are swollen, because they have eaten too much before sleeping, and therefore swelling the breasts, and making them form like women's, and we call it "roman apostemas", which is a swelling.
And to him who has this, cover that which inspects the skin lunar according to this form, from line B to line G, and remove all the roughness, fill the wound with carminative medicine, and adjust both lips of the wound sewed together, and cure it until it is healthy.
But if the nipple falls to the parts and is softened by its size as it were in women, then it is divided into two sides like two scars resembling a lunar figure, each containing the other, until the major line contains the smaller one, according to this form from line B to line G. Then remove the cord which is between the two lips of the wound, and cut off the fat, and administer as has been said of the suture and of the powder, that it may be applied while the wound heals and becomes healthy.
If you do not complete the incision of this place where it can be incised for the discomfort of the disease, and for the flow of sickness, then it is likely that the plague will submerge into your mouth corrosive and gentle, and that which is corroded in the body enters that which rots, namely the flesh, and you must cure the inside so that it heals.
Chapter Forty-eight.
Of the perforation of abscesses that leave behind a tickling sensation.
The abscesses that leave behind a tickling sensation are those of the scrofulas, hard ones, which contain a knot that is sucked out.
And of those some contain moisture; and those that contain moisture must be incised at the lunar section according to this figure: from the line G to the line B. And when all that is evacuated from within the abscess, then you cut the edge violently and gently into the other day.
And place the wound so as to be closed and healed with a mouth suitable for it, inside until it heals.
If the swelling of the nodes and scrofulas is present, and then you cut over that area as we have said in the section about scrofulas.
If the plague is extended in that way so that it causes burning sensation, then administer cauterization in him as we have previously said.
Chapter 49.
On the section of swellings that occur due to strangulation or through a vein.
When strangulation is broken and the cord is consolidated over it, if there are swellings that occur, then look for these signs to know that inflammation and swelling are caused by an artery or a vein: when an apostema occurs due to strangulation, it becomes long and swollen on the surface of the body; and when you feel it, you hear a stridor.
And that which is due to a vein becomes swollen around the face of the body.
This section about the apostema is an error, and it occurs especially in those who are left with swellings, anguines, and a lump on the neck and in other places of the body; and it is of great size, so that it's likely to be avoided if its cure is not sought.
A man afflicted with an arrow wound through his bow arm must be cut from the middle section of the intestine in the long part; and take out the arrow and apply to the incision until it is discovered.
And apply the wound to that arrow and make it penetrate into another place; and fasten the arrow with two cords in two places, which causes you to be inextricably linked with two arrows which are in the temples.
Apply pressure to the location between two joints with a sponge until it stops bleeding and dissolves the abscess.
Apply treatment in which poison is injected into the joint where it causes pain to come on, and apply the appropriate remedy to this until it heals.
If it is an abscess from a cut on the vein, then cover that with your hand where it may be a possible location for the abscess on the intestine, and apply the needle to that place; and let it penetrate; and be in that ligature double between what you extract from the other side, and tie up the abscess to both joints according as I have said to you in the joint of the grape of two parts to the two extremities of the thread.
If you fear that the vein will be drawn, then enter the needle into the same spot as before, and pull out all the remaining tissue with the first puncture, and strongly grasp your veins in four places.
Then dry the remaining tissue in the middle of where it entered when it was coming out, as long as you inscribe the superficiality of the cord, and make it thinner because of that.
And place over the pulp which you have submerged in wine and oil, and administer the cure which is made with caustic and vinegar until it heals.
Let it be known that the separation of the tissue occurs when a nerve is twisted.
It happens that the separation of the tissue occurs in an artery and a vein, as well as in nerves when they are struck or occur due to excessive effort or strain, similar to.
And it is done that the more of them be in the joints of the assistants or the toes, or all where the joints are swollen.
A grave ulceration has set in, and it is colored like the rest of the body, and its location is most favorable for its progression; when it is straight, I feel as though the patient is in a state of madness.
It is not an ulceration that has been caused in the forepart of the body, and therefore they leave him chained, for he will be cut to pieces and not sent before or behind.
Therefore this is also true for those who are in the joints, that they do not wish to be closed with iron, because it would give them a strong contraction.
But one who is in the head or on the forehead will have the chain wrapped around a staff. But if it is an ulceration very little, then they will take out the fistula and dissect those tissues from the bone.
And if it is large, then you will suspend it with an onion, and excise that part, and place a splint on it; and adjust the wound with stitches, and cure that within until it heals.
The end of the text.
Wound from an apendix that occurs in the ear which happens to the stomach.
Evening after swollen knots found in the bellies of those and other parts of their body which are called fungals because they resemble fungi, whose cause is subtle and its head is large; whereas the lips of some are turned inside, and it is larger in some than in others, and is magnified in some.
I have seen one, and in its belly there were two knots that resembled fungi but had no difference between them in color, from some tiny cause.
The lips of those were turned inside and split, and moisture flowed from that part for a long time.
So I cut them open and pulled out the first one about 18 inches, and the other one about 6 inches.
And the operation in the incision of their openings is that when you consider if the disease is moist, and the color of the tissue is white, moist, from a subtle cause; then you cut it with a spatula, and they are in your presence, cauterized by fire, because you see wounds often caused by this is expelled for safety; and if you have seen that, cauterize it.
If the patient suffers from severe and terrifying fever, beware of the onset of inflammation with iron; but sometimes take a reliable dose of lead made fresh, and strengthen it in that manner which they have said; and let it be read for two days.
And adjust in the structure of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to strengthen the larger lead when cut, until it is separated and falls apart for its own work.
But if the thread is of large size, there will be no cause for fear and terror in its onset, and more so in one who is in the belly.
But perhaps it is possible that you cut the middle of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And cure that within as long as the plague is healed.
And be careful that you do not cut the thread which is of dark color, with little feeling, on the back guard, because that is a cancer.
And you will remember the experience about it.
Book of the Twelfth.
The treatment of the prominence of the navel.
The prominence of the navel is caused by various reasons; or through fissures of the diaphragm which is over the abdomen, and makes the skin or intestine according to where it splits; or through a hernia that flows from a vein or artery as indicated, or due to constricted breath.
But if it is through the diaphragm and by pulling of the skin, then the color of the swelling is similar to that of the body; and it causes great pain, and appears in various situations. But if it is through the protrusion of the hernia, then the situation of that place is similar to where it was previously counted, with great and diverse variation; and when you press those places with your fingers, the swelling becomes hidden, and return it; for it is easy to do so, and it is magnified by the motion of bathing and vigorous work.
But if it is due to humidity, then it is painful and not hidden when you press with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is it compressed.
If it's for treatment, then look for these signs that appear on the swelling turning black.
But if it's due to flesh, then there is a serious swelling, gross and hard, that forms in a certain quantity.
But if it's due to inflammation, then the affected area is swollen.
And the operation on it is that if you consider that the swelling is due to an arteria or a vein, or inflammation; then cover that area, because there is fear and dread about cutting into it, as I said in the chapter where I explained the swellings due to arteria and veins.
And if the swelling is due to the intestine or the membrane, then cover that the patient should hold still and be extended; and apply pressure in the circuit of the entire umbilicus, and command the patient to remain with his hands over his navel, and to place a bandage or tie on the opposite side of your hand over his two, and to surround with a strip of cloth in the circuit of the umbilicus over the location where you have felt the pressure; and then extend the size of the swelling towards those parts by one large; and apply a firm or loose tie in the manner of securing it.
When you will have put the middle of the swollen lymph node into the incision and inserted your finger in that place, and if you do not feel nor see the intestine through the membrane, then immediately extract it and push the hernia towards the parts of the belly where it belongs.
If you have touched the membrane, then immediately take a spoon and insert it into him.
But if it is opposed to your arrow or vein, then immediately surround that spot, and return to your operation; take two needles and put them in those two strong and sharp holes, and insert the other two needles into the circuit which you have made around the lymph node in a cross-shaped manner, so that they may penetrate; and tighten the lymph node in four parts over the needles.
If you wish, pull out the needles and allow the wound to heal itself as soon as possible by allowing the stretched skin to contract and fall in place; or insert it when it is subtle and softens, and then apply that cauterization here so that it may cover the infected flesh until it heals.
If the prominence of the navel is of no flesh or due to humidity, then cover what we have said and expose the hernia so that you may see and heal it, which will become and consolidate the place.
Chapter 33.
Treating the flea.
We have already discussed, in the division, of the type of flea and how to approach its treatment with medicines, and what is most important in treating it with iron so that it does not become ulcerated; and we have discussed fleas born in the marrow and cautery for their treatment.
And they said that some ancient fleas are in locations where it is possible to eradicate them, just like the flea which is in the breasts or in the cleft and has the appearance of the limbs allocated to extract all those ones, and more so when it starts small.
But what is old and is big, cannot be applied to it, because you have not been able to heal from that one ailment or I have not seen another, nor has it become so bad that it reached this point.
And the operation on it is when it is allocated just as we have said, is that you precede and remove the illness and purge black bile from time to time, and apply pus to it, if it is severely inflamed with visible manifestation.
Prepare the patient with preparation in which is located the site of the operation, and prophesies in the tract until those coves that cover are there; and concave all parts on the good code with thorough examination before any cause of them breaks down. Let the wound run freely, and do not apply any stopping or stenching; and press the wounds, and cleanse them with your hand or with an instrument to which is applied.
But if you find an opposition of great wound, of vein or artery, then cauterize that within until the flow of the wound is stopped, and cure it with another cure until it heals.
Chapter on Living
On the treatment of dropsy.
We have already discussed, in the division, of the species of dropsy due to water, and the signs of each species, from the treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is not the same as the species of gout only, nor is it approximated to the species of tympanic dropsy or yaws, for it is mortal.
If you have already treated this kind of dropsy with tympanic medicine and do not comfort your own treatment, then consider this, because if the disease has already reached debility in the patient, or is another illness besides dropsy, so as to be like another, perhaps coughing, chest pain, etc. similar to those, you have to be careful that you do not give him iron medicine, for fear is about this.
But if you believe the patient has excess vertigo and is not another disease but only dropsy alone, and there are no children or old people, then the method of the operation is that you lift the patient between your hands, and administer to him maximum pressure on his abdomen with your hand, pressing water at the beginning of the opening (left side) of the penis, and apply spatum spinos according to this form:
Whether it is from two acute parts long, like spatum, but still in small quantity little by little, so that during the operation, he does not enter into the intestine, and both sides.
And therefore consider that the generation of dropsy is from the parts of the intestines, because you know that it is in the section that is farthest from the navel by three digits to the left openings, on the penis.
If the generation of water is due to disease of the liver, then your section is on the left side of the navel for three days.
If the generation of bile is due to gallstones, then your section is in the lower three areas.
And it should not be located on the side on which you will be applying the patient, lest the superfluities accumulate at that location and cause trouble.
And let the instrument cut all along the cord, then insert it into that section, and lift up your hand with the spatula between the cord and the sphincter, and exorcise that; if its amount is less than a finger or near.
And let the sphincter be perforated where the spatula will reach, and if it is full of water. And let this [the contents] be extracted and inserted into an instrument of the following form: and is made of silver or lead or of latex leather, to which at the lower end there is a small suture, and on its sides are three sutures: two from one side and one from the other side; and the instrument is made so that it is incised at the tip according to the manner of a needle, as if with plums.
It is located above the area of pain when an instrument is submerged in water, and it is necessary to drain that same amount of water from the instrument, because if you drain more than that, then the disease will not cover in the hour, and a heavy death will occur for the resolution of his spirit animal, or accidents happen to him five times, which is approaching death.
May drain from that according to the amount of virtue in him, and according to how the arrangements of his disease relate to the virtue of his pulse and goodness.
And take out the instrument, and tie back the water which is why it is retained by the cord, because it ties up the throat which is over the chest from where you perform that according to that manner.
And iterate the instrument to another day if the patient tolerates it again, and drain a small amount of water, and do that for a few days on fear, and be careful not to break through the water but just little.
But if you fear the disease, and drain a large amount of water, then cover it with a layer of sand in a cool place, and wait for a long time by the sun; and cure him with drying medicines until he is healthy.
Cure yourself on the stomach, and the belly and the intestines will be brought back by the extraction of water, as I have recounted in this before that is written.

On the treatment of children who have not perforated their urethral meatuses.
Some of the children are born with their uterus in its place, and the head of their mixed sex is not perforated (or is straight or not in its proper position).
So cover the cavity with a covering until it is born after several months, as this form.
And place in the straight part a small nail of lead and tie it, for three days or .iiii. three times.
And when the urine is brought back and urination resumes, return it.
And if you do not tie off the lead, it is possible that the urine which accumulates on the spot will leak through this closure.
The translation is: "But that one from whom it comes straight is treated with a lead clip, as they have said, for three days until it is increased.
The translation is: "But those in which the source is not in its place are led to it, because of that, that one who is born with the rupture is due to the end of the head of the stricture so he cannot urinate during the ascent of the swelling with his hand in the lower parts; and it's not a generation, therefore because the sperm cannot reach the uterus according to nature, and it's an illness called stricture.
The translation is: "And the manner of the operation in him is that the patient be covered with a cloth over his feet, and stretch out the head of the stricture from him with your left hand without violent extraction, and inscribe the tip of the head of the stricture into the perineum with a sharp instrument, as an inscription of a quill, or so that you do not cut any part, therefore the middle of him appears like the head of the stricture and the source falls in the middle place according to its nature.
Watch yourself that in your operation of blood flow and discharge, four moments may occur; pause yourself at the moment when you cut the vein, and cure the wound until it is healed.
Seventy-fourth chapter.
Of the foreskin, which happens in the prepuce at the head of the penis, causing congestion, corruption, and darkening and adhesion to the skin of the penis.
Occasionally, accidents happen in this foreskin at the penis and the skin-covered area of the glans.
And from those two, one is malignant and the other is non-malignant.
Non-malignant, how you will bind with a subtle thread and cut it out within that entire surface; and place a pause on that cutaneous spot in the Egyptian manner; and place another one, cure the blood inside, until it is healed.
And if the foreskin is malignant, of dark color, as it happens with the skin; how you will minister cauterization to place along its incision and the ratio of its cut.
When the foreskin of the uncircumcised man is torn apart, and one part is separated from it and the other part is outside, therefore, cover that which is inside until it becomes consolidated; and then cure the outside, because when you cure the foreskin, it's not guaranteed that there won't be an abscess.
And now also accidents happen in the knees and in the black foreskin as well, therefore cover everything that is already corrupted or has become rotten, and place a line over it with honey, which is injured by flour of rye and three times crushed and ground.
And then cure that as well with the other cure until it is safe.
But if there is an issue with the flow of medicine, therefore administer a lunar cautery in this manner:
because the lunar cautery is applied twice to the affected areas, once for the flow of medicine and again when the plague has corrupted it.
And if the head of the foreskin is completely corrupted and destroyed in that hour, therefore cover that you insert a leaden cannula into the flesh of the foreskin so that the infection urinates through that place.
In the attachment of the foreskin to the glans penis (and this attachment does not occur in those who have had circumcision; and when it occurs due to inflammation or phimosis), you should scrape off the callus with a blunt instrument before it is dissolved, loosen the ligament, and set free the head of the penis from all parts.
If it is difficult to separate those extremely tightly adhered parts, then you should scrape off the callus with a blunt instrument at any cause of the head of the penis and the foreskin, so that the foreskin, when subtle, is lightly perforated by its subtlety slightly.
And carefully separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a thin instrument, which is already matted in the water that you wipe it with, so that they do not adhere again elsewhere.
And apply a styptic in the wound until it is consolidated.
Chapter LVII.
On the simplification of children and on the treatment for those who have had circumcision.
Circumcision is not the solution to continence: but rather it is with our operation and our will, that the effect of which should be proper in children, it is necessary to assign a better operation and way lighter to lose, so as to save health.
Then they did not say circumcision in any of their laws, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only because they have acquired it by experience, which is that you have tried the major part of the artificers and barbers who cut and circumcise with a knife and a torch; and they use linen bandages around the neck and ligatures around the finger.
And I have already tried all these methods and did not find better circumcision with forceps, ligatures that in circumcision with the finger, because most of the time you escape the code, which is the cord of the foreskin twice, and leave the tone more, and it's very light to be another incision and secure pain. And that is the circumcision which is done by apothecaries, and it's digital, of which the barbers use, but the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secure, because it enters very lightly into the tissue.
Mistakes are made in the operation, a heavy blow opens wounds and ruins your work. The cord of the child is short by nature, and sometimes you find it in that manner so much that there is no need for circumcision.
However, circumcision has made foreskin and laments because of a false experiment, for the foreskins are too small an opening, therefore as the sharpness is lost in them, so is it in others; hence, when you press your hand according to proportioned sharpness, and inscribe accordingly at one time, then compression is done on the foreskin contained within the figuration of the clitoris, which covers all parting, with no error from any.
The manner of the first operation is that you make the child mostly aware if it is one of those who understand a little, and do not make but rather let the foreskin alone on its genitals, only allowing it to enter into another day.
And then keep that child joyful in all that manner, as much as is possible, so that it receives its intelligence. And then arrange the patient in your best position, and do not let them see that; and hide the scars in your hand or cover your foot so that the child will not see it or any other of the instruments.
And then enter your hand into the vulva and blow on the cord, and pull it in so that it exposes the head of the vulva, and smooth out what is added to it from stench.
The shape of the bowels on a patient's body, this is the form:
The nails are not cut and the others are cut, so that the branch of the key does not come out, and is equal to the length of two fingers equal in length.
But the error in shaping is that you should escape from the inner chain all, or part of it, since the incision.
Then cover that which is on your hour, with your finger against the opening of the place and cut it in according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your finger, then cut it out with an onion and incise.
But if it has been three days and the inflammation remains behind the urethral opening, then let you cut into it until the swelling becomes cauterized, and excoriate it with ease, and incise it according to what is prepared for you.
And guard yourself from the head of the urethra, lest it comes out there.
And therefore cure that person, because the wound heals from the powder, which has been prescribed in the treatment of powders.
If it is inflamed with the cord or on measure, and follows the agreed parts, it will not be noticed to him.
And may cure that person, so that they heal.
Chapter LVIII.
On the cure of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by oppression due to a stone or a pebble, or by spongy or congealed fat, or by pour or by flesh, and resembles those of which they have spoken about the methods of cure on division.
And if it is not dissolved as said, then vigorously is made the cause of the illness, namely the extraction with an instrument called a siringua, which has this form: A sword of silver and a subtle lion-like conqueror, so that with a sharp tube, like a small nail, in similarity to half a palm, there is a subtle point at its head.
And the method of draining the urine is that you take the doubled thread and tie it with the wool or fur at the end, with good knotting; and inserts the extremities of the thread into the opening on the siringua, and insides them with force if any cause of the wool superfluous exists, but puts them in the tube with violence.
And heal the patient on the stool, and grasp the bladder of him and the vagina with oil and unctueous substances.
When cold humors are introduced into each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And now carefully extend the infected area onto the wool thread little by little, because urine dries up the wool.
And remove that and tie it for urine treatment, and use a ligature, do not cease doing this until the bladder is evacuated and the malady takes hold of alleviation.
Conclusion.
Of the quality of enemas for the bladder, which are performed with a clamp and instruments similar to this one.
When an ulcer or abscess occurs in the bladder, or a scab congeals in that place, or it is contracted by poultice, and you want to drain it from that location, then do so with an instrument called clampcedra, and this is how it is done:
Unless the extremity of it is deafened, then it is closed. And in that place there are three tracks: two from one parting, and sometimes also.
In the beginning there is a concave place, in which it is enclosed, and according to its quantity, it opples that, its addition. When no cause occurs near that opening of humidity, it is pushed out, and when it is expelled, it is pushed out, and when it is expelled far, according to how the ligature with naphtha coated on the battles of the sea.
When you want to induce humidity in the bladder, insert the tip of a crooked instrument into the humidity and attract the water that is pressed towards the parts above, because the humidity is drawn into the cavity of the crooked.
And insert the tip of the crooked instrument into the vagina according to what has been recorded in the circular writings; and draw towards it the humidity with that water, because that humidity goes to the bladder immediately, and makes the patient ill.
The subtle shape of the stone by which the bladder is calcified, and it is that shape:
And it is made of silver or lead, of which the head is either similar to a small feather, and let him crawl down in lamentation.
And take the bladder of leather, and pause there the humidity which you want to crystallize in the bladder, and place it between two strong ligatures with a lead double, and scorch that humidity over the fire.
And insert the tip of the stone into the vagina.
I will not translate this line.
If it is not present to you the bladder, then take a pess of parguames and make a circle; pierce that completely in its entire redundancy; place firmly into those tracks, so that it is turned; and add the circle so it is also added, as if it were attached, for as long as you pause in that area where you wish to put the humidity, oil and water.
And take that and attach it to the instrument; make it in that way as you have done with the bladder, and express your hand into where the humidity will pass into the bladder.
I think I see what's going on here. It seems like "Capitol.lx." is a reference to a medieval medical manuscript, with ".lx." indicating that it's a 130th page or folium. Is that correct?
Of the extraction of stones.
We have already said in the division of stones, their species, and their treatment with medicines, and the differences between stones born in the joints and stones born in the bladder, and their signs.
They have said on the page in which they have made operation by hand, and it is divided.
And the page born on the bladder itself is that which is placed in the bladder.
Now I will narrate this clear and concise explanation.
So I say that the page born in the larger bladder is present more frequently in children, and from its signs it can be inferred that the urine emerging from the bladder is similar to water in subtlety, and appears on that sand; and thus it inflames the groin, and frequent pains occur, and because of this, a purging comes forth from the bowels.
And it is a cure for children from that age where they have reached 14 years, and it is difficult to cure in the elderly. But in youth, there is half a pound of this (which) is between them.
And of that which the page is larger and the cure is easier; and if it is scanty, it is contrary to that.
When we arrive at the healing of that, first from the beginning of that we must remove the ulcer with a crystal which extracts all the cut on his joints; because sometimes that cut blocks the opening of the foot due to inquiry.
And place the ulcer on his feet and cover it with linen, so that the ulcer descends to the base of the bladder, or jumps out from a certain location sometimes.
And prepare that instrument between your fingers, and let the rest of his body be covered with cloths, so that the whole bladder is pulled down towards the parts that are left.
And search it thoroughly and all around.
Then if you feel the ulcer in the space, then immediately take hold of it tightly with a section on it.
And if you can't reach it with all your hand touch, then cover that you unite with oil the thumb index of your left hand, if the ulcer is in a child, or with the middle finger if it's a young adult, and insert that into his anus. And through the pain that has just ceased to exist in my body. Convert the small intestine, little by little, into the base of the bladder.
Place it back on that spot, and remove it from the parts outside where you cut.
Command the minister to press the bladder against her skin, and command another minister to hold his right hand extended to the parts above, and his other hand retract the cord that lies behind the joints, in the part where the cut was made.
And so, take this spatula which is inserted in such a way that it is the form of this: Cut and divide it in that place where the buttock meets the joint, not at the middle, but towards the left side, at a distance from the joint; and make the incision on that belly and pull your hand tight to the anus, making a transverse incision, so that the incision outside is wide and the straight line according to the amount of belly fat present in that place, not more, lest you press too hard on the intestine which is in the rectum; and thus it will be forgotten in its difficulties.
This condition can cause an issue in any part of the body with angles and margins, making it difficult to treat this area.
And from that area it has a shape similar to a thorn, and is round, and is made of lighter cauterization.
So if it is that part with angles and margins, adjust in the fissure.
And if it is not similarly fixed, then cover that part with something, or strengthen it accordingly, covering the extremity of that part as one would a lime, and do not neglect it; or insert a subtle instrument curved to fit that extremity.
But if you cannot do that, then enlarge the opening a little, and if you see blood flow out, cut it off with strong vitriol.
But if the foot is more of one, then at the beginning you will push the hand into the mouth of the bladder and cut over it; and then push a little further there; and similarly do so for those that are more numerous than two.
If there is a great pain in the joints, then it is due to ignorance that you have inserted a large section, because one of two causes happens to the sickness: either death occurs or someone deviates from the continuous distillation of urine, so that the place is not fully consolidated.
May it be expelled from within that is forgotten, or cleverness in breaking the bone with the forces within so that you extract it out of the feet.
Then once you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with these of aloe and dragon's blood, and strengthen it. And place your hand on that wrapped dressing in oil and vinegar, or in scented oil and water, to prevent the apostemata from growing.
And place the patient on their back, and do not delay laying them down after the third day.
And when they have been laid down, bind the area with water and oil, and apply cure to it with sulfur vinegar and sulfur powder until the sickness is healed.
Joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And then appropriate treatment for the wound should be applied with vinegar and water, salt and opposition to all sorts of disease, for it is known that this applies to the cure between when the sickness is entered.
Cover the patient with both sheets and adjust the medicines that have been placed on the area.
If the lump is small and it is in the meat of the vulva, and it festers in that place, and the urine emanating from it is forbidden, then cure that with water as you previously recommended before going to section, because many people have been cured with this operation and were accused of wasting time; and I have already seen that, which is why you should take a perforator of iron (likely referring to a surgical instrument)
of triangular shape, pointed, placed in a fist.
And place the thread, and tie it around that vulva, so that the lump does not return to the bladder.
And insert the iron into the vulva, piercing with facility inside so that the piercer arrives at that lump. Turn the perforator with your hand in that small pit slowly and carefully, and you will perforate the opening into the other side, so that the urine will immediately be released.
Place your hand over that area which is numb at the entrance of the vagina, because it is punctuated and is forgotten with urine, and the patient becomes healthy.
However, if this cure does not work at your workshop for any reason that prohibits it from happening to the woman, then place a faithful servant above the vagina and another below the vagina. Place needles into the vagina between two layers of skin. Remove that. Loosen the bandage and expose the infected wound, which is made in the inflammation.
It is not necessary to tie the faithful servants on the vagina, but rather so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other bandage above, because when you loosen the servants near the genitals, the cord returns to its place and causes the inflammation.
It is necessary for you to bind the patient's wrists, so that you elevate the limbs on both sides, or return your compliments, and receive payment for this work as we have said.
Chapter LXI.
On the extraction of the gall from the females.
The gall in women is rarely produced.
But if there is gall in any of those (females), then it is very difficult to cure it, and it is prohibited by many foolish men.
One of them is that a woman who is heavy in her loins (i.e. with a large abdomen) is very ill.
And the second is that you will not find a woman who does not recognize herself when she is sent to the doctor as adulterous, or as having been deflowered if she has no husband.
The third is that you will not find a woman who does not know this art, more so the operation by hand.
And the fourth is that the place of section on gall in women is longer than the place of section on gall, therefore you must perform a precordial section and there is fear.
May it become necessary to be present there, then cover that you will take a female midwife who is well known, and few are terrified.
May you be absent from that, then seek out a midwife who is skilled and discreet, or present a wise elderly woman well-versed in the arts of women, or one who has been separated from her craft.
So present that person and command them to do all what you have sent me for, from the inquiry about the period to the beginning; because that is why they should examine if the woman is virgin, then she will put her word in the arse of him and wants the period.
So if you encounter that person, then cut off that area, and then command them to mark or write on that.
May she if not a virgin, then command the midwife to insert her word in the wound of the sick person and inquire about the period, because then she will put her left hand over the bladder, and buy that good understanding.
So if she encounters that, then cover yourself that the man will marry that woman of the womb's opening to the parts left from her virtue until it comes to the rational sense of the case.
If you want to find the source of some pain in that particular joint, place your finger on the spot where the pain is located, and hold it with a firm pressure, so that the words of the afflicted person are not muffled by their throat.
And the section should be brief at first; then place the needle on that section, and if it feels the pain, then adjust in that section according to how much the pain will be driven out from that.
And you know that the kinds of pain are varied: there is small and large, sharp and hard, long and round, without thorns.
So you know how many kinds are of them for that which I speak about, concerning what you want to mention.
And if you see blood coming from the wound, adjust in that spot where the venom is poured for three hours until it is discharged, and then return to your operation until the pain is forgotten.
And prepare to you the instruments which I said in the extraction of pain from men, so that they may be helped in those who are under your operation.
If you see discharge of pus, and know that the expulsion of pus is through the arrow, which is inscribed, then pour powder on the spot and draw that thread closely, and do not repeat that; and lightly tie the skin and do not extract it, because for light, the disease will kill the patient. Let's cure the plague.
Then since the pus has been drained, and the wound is closed, then return to your operation until the skin is forgotten.
Chapter 62.
On the treatment of hernias.
A hernia is just an accumulation of humidity in the white part which contains the cord of the genitals, and it's called a cord.
And some cases are in the own fold of the intestine which one has prepared nature at the beginning of the cord, while it is already another cord; and it's the cord of the genitals between the white part that we have said, but this is not a hernia, but a tumor.
The generated humors are weak and occur in the genitals, causing this material to accumulate there, and sometimes it happens due to percussion done on the genitals.
This humidity has many different colors, since the color of it is either declining to yellow, red, or black, or it's a brown feces, or it's pale white, and this is what is more.
These signs by which it is known where this water accumulation is located are: when it's in the white ciphac (intestine), then the apostema (a fold of skin) is round and declining a little along its length like a crescent moon, and it appears on the genitals, since the humidity contains that from all parts.
If the humidity is in its own navel, then the skin fold is round and separated from the moon shape and so it's thought to be another body.
If the humidity is between the folds of the genitals and the white intestine, then there are spaces of 1 centimeter.
As you wish to know the knowledge of the color of the humidity, then you must observe the color of the skin fold between which this crescent shape is formed; and according to what it is seen in the vestige (scars) of the middle part, judge from there what it is.
When we come to the treatment of a sick person with fever, as long as they command that they be given flea bites if it is possible for them, and sometimes on their skin.
And let them lie on their backs over their two couches for a short time and pause leaving them with some of their movements.
And let you sit on the left side of him, and command the minister to follow his right side, which stretches his leg from one to two fingers towards the joint of the knee and to the end of the thigh.
And take the sap of the lattuce and split the joint of the knee in the middle, along its length near the femoral tendon.
And it should be done the second section, according to the rule of the golden proportion, at a distance from the line that you should cut the femoral tendon, until it reaches the white cephalexin containing.
And excise that, observe it, and keep to this so that you do not inscribe on it; and your excision has which you excised by cutting at the joint where it is suspended with the hair may more and subtly examine according to the quantity possible.
Appropriate perforate the phlegm-filled cavity with water, and extract all the water.
Appropriate separate the two labia of the section with the uncis, and extend the cavity to the parts above; do not touch the cord at the groin level, including the genitals, and insert the cavity in that manner as is possible. Insert the cord entirely or in the abdomen, and more importantly into its subtle fat, because if you do not carefully examine the insertion of it, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the hot process proceeds from that outside of its cord in the time of your operation, as soon as you have completed the section of the cavity, return it, and then properly adjust the two labia of the cord at the groin with suture, and properly treat that ass like the other wounds until it is healed.
And if the hot process corrupts the heat because of another illness, as soon as cover it with vessels which are sore on the suspensory, and extract the heat, and then properly treat it with water that we have said.
If water is added to both sides in equal parts, then it will know that they are the hernias; therefore, inscribe that part according to what you have done in the other entry; and if it seems to you that it is an operation, then do so.
And thus, you should abate the incision, and enter into the sections of the skin submerged in oil or rose oil; and pause before another piece of skin which you have submerged in vinegar and oil, and expand it over two genitours and the miracle of the belly; and pause upon folded drapes and powder, and place those on the ligament that is according to this form:
And thus, take two drapes and fill them with crimson wool according to this resemblance; and fasten the extremities at which it is inserted of cotton or wet skin, and attach them to the structure in the breeches of the braies, and one extremity takes the buttock into the other, and the second takes the pantaloon, and two extremities on two cushions, and two others on two anglers, so that all the structure is adjusted in the breeches of the braies.
When some cases of this hernia are treated artificially with cautery instead of cutting with iron; and it is because you take the sharp needle and insert it into that cord at the groin, and ignite according to how they have recorded until it discovers the white bag containing water, and then you take cautery as described above: And it is assembled in Greek letters.
And then perforate that bag, and ignite it so that all the humidity is evacuated.
And then extend the bag with scissors, and excise with scissors, and excise with sharp needle ignited; and insert it so that it is at your disposal until you eradicate all of it; and be careful not to touch the hot fuel.
You know that this operation is more safe and more prolonged than the flow of blood, and better than cutting.
But if in the cutting or cautery operation you have a contrary situation of asthma, then cover it accordingly since that is what your cure does to counteract it, following the treatment which suits the case as said.
If the illness is severe and does not hope for a second operation due to its horrible nature, then administer perforation according to what I advise; and it is when you are certain that you should do so, because of what we have said about the significance, that that hernia is incurable.
Carefully place that you will sew the sickness onto a raised scar above, cut and perforate the appendix at the lowest part of it with a pointed stick, and pause the perforation according to the length of the body.
And be careful to look thoroughly as you sew all the inside water.
And pause over that spot and press it firmly with the finger, because you need to stop the rest of the water. And treat it well until the sickness is healed.
But if there is opposition to the water in that hour, you perforate it: and this is not done for that reason that the white panniculat (panniculus) in the orifice of the wound causes opposition and prevents the discharge of the water, therefore cover that you may put into the wound pain or instrument by which the water is extracted from the lymphatics, the form of which is preceded; or adjust to the opposite of the wound a small one.
It appears to be describing the treatment of gout.
Chapter 63.
Treatment of hernias in the flesh and its cure.
Be aware that in the cutting of this hernia, there is a great fear of perniciousness in major dispositions; therefore it appears to me that its removal is salvation.
And I remember the operation on those and the specialities of the appendix.
Therefore I say that the appendix naturally occurs in the bodies where the genitals are joined and it is done so for various causes: either because of an acute hyperinflation, which is poured into the genitals, or by percussion.
And it is the color of the appendix according to the color of the body, and not in the place of pain, but a severe one.
And it is lightly located the appendix embedded, of which the color is dark, and not in its pain.
And sometimes it is made by contraction of the arteries, and because of inflammation of those, as when they are perceived to be remembered, or because of the veins.
This condition is known when the swelling causes a separation of the tendons upon pressing on those parts; and it should not be touched.
But that which is caused by swelling of a vein is not separated from it by any cause due to the pressure on those parts.
And it is also possible that there may be a separation of this kind on other parts, and that's because you should inspect the tendon of the genitores, and press it onto those parts, extract the cord from the white tissue, and deliver the suspensory ligament of the veins, and tie them up, and insert the suspensory more than you deliver that one from all parts of the joint of the arm.
Therefore if the joint is already solid in those parts, it is convenient that you extract the joint and tie it up.
And if there is adhesion into any cause of the membrane, or between that which is between the veins, it is convenient that you deliver all that adhesion and tie it up with a round knot.
If there is an injury of the flesh in the place of attachment which is behind, you should cover what is left of it and extract it from here as they have said.
Then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and vinegar, and apply another cure on top so that it may heal.
Chapter 64.
On the cure of an intestinal hernia which is small.
It is an appendage enveloped by no similar covering like a small bud with softening of the testicles, and it causes difficult movement and walking on the patient.
And in the cure of this disease, there is recollection for fear thereof that precedes.
However, cover to say operation as they did first.
And say that you should fasten the patient on a raised board; and place the suspender of the testicles at the left side; and place the cord of the genitials at the thighs, with the hands tied behind the back; and hold another assistant as well as yourself, and stretch those out with great force.
Appropriate incisions are made along the length of the spine to section it across the middle, so that the vessels may be uncovered.
Appropriate exorcisms are to be performed on the entire affected area, as you have said in the extraction of the arrow wounds that are located in the temples.
Appropriate fix the needle in which there is a faithful double thread, and tie that one to the first part of the location where it occurs, and tie another at the back of it. Appropriate incisions are made in the middle of that one along the third section according to the length of the body, and extract from it what is adhered by the foul and corrupted humors.
Appropriate treat the plague with a treatment of other plagues in which you wish to be born in order that the vessels may fall that are nourished by one of two genius, because it is not bad for this.
But if it occurs in all the vessels, therefore cover them that the testicles be extracted or that the testicles are broken because of the vessels, so that they may be deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they may wither, or because that they do not be young in those.
Book 75.
The treatment of intestinal hernias.
The advent of this hernia occurs because of a rupture that pushes into the expanded ciphac over the belly from one part of the navel's miracle, so when the intestines' pouches come from that tear to all the pouches.
This rupture is either of the ciphac or due to excision from it, and these two kinds occur by various causes: percussion, through a crash, through shouting, through elevation of some great cause, or through resemblance.
The sign of this, when it is an extension of the ciphac, occurs gradually over a long period of time, and does not suddenly occur, and it is an inflamed vein inside the intestine before it compresses the pouch.
The sign of it is when it is a rupture of the ciphac, where at the beginning it causes sudden violent pain; and it is an inflammation with various appearances behind the attached cord, and this is due to the pouch, and its body lies outside from the parts before the ciphac.
Some cases are forgotten outside the intestine, and it is called this intestinal hernia zipper.
Some cases are caused by inflammation, some cases crack through the intestine, and it is caught there, and it is with great perniciousness of the disease, and some cases cause a deep evil pain and more when pressed.
And in the treatment of these spices of this disease is fear that iron is feared, because it may be avoided to catch the hunt in that place.
And the manner of operation of that is that you command the patient to reduce the intestine with your hand to the parts of its cavity if it obeys your return, and place a layer over his colon between your hands, and raise his legs.
And properly tie the cord which you call the cord of the testicles to the parts below, and inscribe the entire cord of the testicles all along; and place it in two labia of the section according as you request to have the section near those.
If the section should be performed according to the quantity that you can possibly forget about from that,
And approach the scrotum with which they leave the cord of the testicles, before it is discovered the white horned part from any side.
As you enter your word in that which is sliced the testicle, in that where the white horned part is, which leaves the cord of the hot one, and between the horns, free from the adhesion that is in the back part of the heat.
And pull back the cord of the testicles to both sides before, and thus extend the white horn in its place on your right hand, and lift up the hot one with the horn towards the beginning of the section; and command the minister to stretch out the hot one upwards, and you dissolve the adhesion behind the completed solution.
And seek about your words that there is not any cause of the intestine wrapped in the white horned part. But if you find any cause, then you will enclose it inside the abdomen.
Piercing at the place left by the separation of the testicles, according to the section through which there flows a certain purgation and cleansing as we have previously stated in this.
A doctor should give the patient a dressing soaked in oil and pause on the wound; and give the ligature which we have recorded (and sometimes the white linen is cauterized, which we have said to be avoided at the beginning of the wound, because it tempts the flow of blood, which happens several times).
But if the wound is late, and water has fallen into it, then pour some on it over that it may fall according to what they have said.
And cure the wound at another healing of wounds, until it is cured.
Section 66.
On ventrous hernias.
In this type of hernia, there is nothing to be seen on the surface during the healing with iron.
And the first said that it is a fact on the inside of what has been recorded in the hernia, which is at this place; where you tie the vessels close to the section over that with ease; and dry it up in the middle location in the vicinity of the apostaema where it occurs, until the vessels fall.
The text means: And treat the wound according to what they have said until it is healed.
The text means: Chapter LVII.
The text means: Of the rupture that is done in the joints.
The text means: Some cases have ruptured tendons in the joints as they have said, and the tendon protrudes from the place.
The text means: And do not attribute any cause to the uterus; and if you do, it is rare, and returns in all hours.
The text means: But if the time is prolonged with this, an adjustment of the fissure in the scaphoid bone occurs before the budel emerges in the scaphoid; and it happens so because of the extension of the scaphoid bone just as has been said, which is the cause that when the scaphoid is stretched, it becomes soft, and the place becomes a boil, and protrudes.
The text means: And the treatment of him is with cautery as it was preceded by his narration.
Some people are cured with this method: and it is that the patient places his two hands between yours, and you dry the place of the rupture of the tendons over the section according to the quantity of three days.
And you should straighten the white ribbon that is under the chain, so that it becomes visible.
And you should take the needle and pause it over the place of the rupture of the ribbon, and press it onto the navel.
And you should cut the two places over the extremity of the needle of the ribbon, and join one with the other.
And you should remove the extremity of the needle, and do not cut off the ribbon entirely, nor extend the thread, nor another cause this as if you did not know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And you should cure that with the treatment of wounds, and when you penetrate the flesh, clean it up and restore the wound into what is consolidated; for if the ribbon is contracted and not joined to the place of rupture.
Cauterizing is better in this place, because it is more conducive to health.
Chapter LXVIII.
On the softening of the cord of the testicles.
Small scars are found on the testicles in some men, where the softening is noticeable because the muscles between them are softened, and this is a sign of it.
Therefore, it is necessary for one who knows how to cure him, to make the patient lie on his back, and to encase the entire cord which is softened over the natural cord; and he should adjust two flaps at the junction.
And if you wish, to cut at the beginning of the softened cord with three or four incisions and a firm suture.
And insert stitches between the sutures, and cure by surgery of the other wounds until the patient is healed and the incisions are closed.
Chapter LXIX.
Removal of the testicles.
You should know that castration is forbidden by law, but it's not the same as remembering this in this book; and you shouldn't recall it unless for two reasons: one is so that the doctor knows when to apply treatment because he needs to know how to cure him; and the other reason is that we often need to castrate other animals too, especially young ones, like horses, cows, pigs, and similar beasts.
Therefore, castration is done in two ways: either by tearing, or by cutting open the section.
But when it is done by tearing, the operation is that we cut the animal in water while its genitalia are softened and relaxed, so they hang down. And then take those inside your own hands so that they are wrapped up and do not appear exposed to touch.
But when it is done by cutting and sectioning, however, you should hold the animal and press the cord of the testicles between your left hand.
To set the suspension, and insert it into any joint where two houses process in one section.
Settle those pus that will cause any excoriating. Do not look at those of the phlegm any cause, but the subtle phlegm that lies on the surfaces.
This method of castration is better that which is done by traction, because traction is lighter and brings no cause to the testicles, so the beast desires its own lust.
Cure the plague while it is still healthy.
Chapter 120.
On the cure for Hermaphroditism.
In men, hermaphroditism is according to two methods: one is when there is a constriction in the space of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, it figures as if there were a woman's member in him, with some fallopians.
And sometimes it appears urine that is in the space of the testicles.
In the females, there is a type: and it is that the blood of the woman over the pubic bone is like two testicles of a man a little more than in the beginning before like the perineum of man and two testicles.
And the cure is of three types: of two for men and one type for women. And so you must compress those fatty tissues inside when they allow the pressure to escape from that one, and then treat those with another cure of the other diseases.
And in the second type of men, from which urine comes, coming out from the cord of the testicles, there is no cure nor operation in it.
Chapter 21.
About the lentige and fatty swelling caused by women.
Lentige that is lightly heavy is compressed over natural causes in which it is tense and is fixed with a leg-like regard; and sometimes, it becomes magnified in some women to such an extent that it spreads like in men and penetrates into the copulation.
You have excess lint due to your hand or with a needle and thread.
And do not stop until you reach the root of the cause, lest it will bring forth a flood of disease.
And let your cure be effective against the plague within, as it heals.
But flesh is born flesh which enters into the horror of the grave within it, and heavy is its load before the partitions are opened according to its semblance (and thus they call this "disease of the tail"); therefore let us inscribe the opposite way as we inscribe lint, and cure it within so that it may heal.
Chapter 82.
On the cure of eczema.
Eczema is that the skin of a woman is not pierced or is torn. And it can be either natural or accidental.
Accidental is because of a disease that preceded it, and that one is done either by flesh that is not well-adjusted or by a subtle or thick phlegm.
It is done or performed in the groin area, or on the sides of it, or above its summit, or below its base, and prohibits cutting and incision and childbirth, and very strongly prohibits menstruation.
It is known to be done for the sake of observing the menstrual flow, if the opening is visible, perform it; but if not, then search for that within the eyelids or in the navel.
But if the opening is due to subtle inflammation, and it is located between the two lips, then cut and disrupt that.
And it is that you place over the two lips powder, and pause on both the eyelids indicating in both the inside of the face.
And the woman is lying on her own two sides, her belly extended, and then extend the two lips under force until that subtle inflammation is ruptured and the opening is opened.
And take wool and put it in oil and place that on the location, and heat it with a hot stone during the day so that the location is not consolidated.
The translation is: If the gallstones are big and thick, then cover them with a sponge or a leaf of myrtle.
If the opthalmia is due to a splinter, then suspend that with an ointment and insert it.
And with these remedies you will stop the flow of bile, by taking acacia, dragon's blood, and essences, adjusting the juice of poplar.
And provide a wide copper tube to prevent the plague from becoming consolidated lightly.
And hold it for acute joints and administer cold water.
And apply this cure to the other remedy of consolidation until it is healed.
And some accidents occur in the main natality of other parts, and thus cover that according to this manner. But if so it is for chronic apothema, lest the chronic apothema which is in the main part be made contrary to iron in any manner.
The 73rd chapter of the book begins.
The treatment of hemorrhoids, tail veins, and bloody redness that occurs in the crotch of women.
Hemorrhoids are formed in the openings of swollen veins that burst constantly, and since they are old hemorrhoids, they will rupture.
And I have already said in the division of the kinds and the signs of those, that those which receive treatment are different from those which do not receive treatment.
So I say that hemorrhoids and those which are not in the anal opening but appear to the sensation, should not be treated with fire.
But those that are in the opening of the anus on which no sensation is felt, these should be treated.
And cover that you put the woman in a moist cloth and wrap the belly tightly with cloth or rough material, inserting those (the dressing) within.
And apply powder over those areas from which flows the blood of one of the poultices inserted with its morsions, as does cassia and similar to those.
Place the patient's feet on a stone for an hour, and place them in cold water afterwards.
If the flow of the spleen persists, then bind it with a decoction of sumac and sorrel and willow bark and similar herbs.
And let him eat bread made from barley and honey and vinegar, and apply an ointment to it on his back.
If the spleen is detached, that is good; if not, bind with two gauzes and apply scarring to the nipples.
And let him eat wool, and immerse that in vinegar of colander or vinegar of angelica or vinegar of gall-nut, with a little wine, and bind to the place; and treat the wound with honey until it heals.
Treat him until he heals.
Chapter 74.
There is a perforation of the eviscerated sac in the major area.
There are special kinds of ingrown apertures that occur in the major area, namely swollen cramps and ingrown apertures, ulcers, inflammation, snakebites, hemorrhoidal rectal prolapse, thrombosis, fistulas, and other apertures. I have already explained these illnesses and the special kinds of them, and their signs in the division.
And I will explain in this book of ingrown apertures that which is contained in the major area when it comes to the ones that can be treated, and if you want to know how to perform the operation with iron.
So then consider whether the pain of the ingrown apertures in your case is sharp with percussion, and flux, and fever, and sometimes it becomes reddened, and if you press on that place, there will be no perforation, and cure it accordingly, using what helps to aid maturity until the sharpness of the accident subsides.
And sometimes cover that you make the woman lie on a wooden board that has two wooden boards; recline her over your two and adjust your limbs to the parting of the belly, so that her thighs are expanded, and pause your breast near her nails, and bind what is necessary at that place.
The translation is: And take the midwife to follow the third layer and administer the instrument with which you have opened up the openings of the uterus, in its shape, it will come upon those causes that will be done.
The translation is: And when you wish to administer this instrument, you will place it in the region of the uterus of the woman, and so that the instrument enters the uterus, not more than the size of the uterus and no worse than the illness. The translation is: But if the instrument is larger than the size of the uterus, then cover that you pause powder over the texture of the uterus so that the instrument does not enter into the entire uterus.
The translation is: And you should pause the texture that runs in the instrument of the last degree and that the minister holds the instrument and rolls it into so that there is a opening in the uterus.
The translation is: And when the cut is made and it is touched with the hand and it is cut and moistened, then cover that you squeeze so that the head of him with salt.
If the sickness is evacuated, then carefully cover that you pause in the wound a macerated substance submerged in oil or oil anointed with any spot, and place the calcaneum in the section before the main.
Pause in front of the main vein and on the tendonless skin submerged in water in which are built mallow poultices.
Let it be treated for two days with an ointment that is suitable to this wound until it heals.
And sometimes the vein and wound are washed out so that it is crystallized in water and honey, and then anointed with water in which there is crushed rue or artichoke long thistle, and then returns to the ointment.
If the wound is dried in the main vein, then carefully cover that you should not have the treatment of it with iron, but rather use the cure we mentioned in the division.
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives in what manner they should give them food that is suitable to their body, according to natural figure.
The translation is:
When you observe those signs, be sure that the belly of him is compressed so that the embryo moves lightly when he lies on his back, and it descends to him the secondina, and it is separated from those surplus flaccidities with a good separation.
But the thing that is at this part is not natural and not excusable, because when the embryo is placed on his feet and his body is placed before his head and his feet, or his hand, or it is placed over his head and his hand, or on his belly, and very light he turns on his back, and similar to his unexcusable figures.
Is necessary that the midwife be wise and subtle in all those causes, and watch out for errors and disappointments.
And I will show you all the figure of those things, and which part is in them so that it should be understood by this and should stand on that.
When it is done on him over his head by natural cause, and that one is vigorous in the woman and made to her a difficult part, and the virtue of him weakened, then he will be cured, or if the women have it, and evaporate the sweat from him with fenugreek oil and onion juice.
When introducing the instrument between the small and large bones of the foot, make a small incision and puncture with the second needle, or prick that one under your nail so that you proceed in this way where there is humidity. Press the woman's abdomen into place as she delivers the fetus.
But if they do not deliver, then it is thought that the woman will be swollen with hair and thread-like mucus and cotton-like phlegm with stitches.
And instruct him, take out the stitches, and that he compress the swelling with a bandage; and bring to his mouth and nose for an hour, so that the child is forgotten soon.
But if the two legs of the fetus are forgotten at first, it is thought that you should gradually decrease them with ease little by little. But if she does not obey the instrument, then pause the woman on a table and lift her legs from her, and place the table over the ground; and the woman should be held tightly so that she does not fall due to the concussion.
If the hands are not returned and the patient dies from the fever, then insert those and extract the remnant of the fetus or bind the body to the hand with a cloth and extract that with an equality, because that man will be forgotten.
When the fetus is on its feet, then carefully move those to fit it, and wrap up the small one, and carefully take hold of the leg and stretch out that little one slowly.
But when it is inserted into the thighs, then you command him to expand, and make that excision in the condition, because he will be forgotten if God does not will.
If it is not forgotten, then you return the small one to its original size, slowly into which you put that second figure, so that he will be forgotten at least with a lesser implantation.
If it is prohibited to touch everything that has been counted, then take the muscle plug from above and dissolve gum, and strike all in the mortar with good percussion, and place a line on this woman's vulva, the flesh of her belly. Place that caeser in water until you can get to the apophysis.
At the times when the parts are loosened, then apply mirthstone and sub-inflate them to him. And when you apply sub-inflation for an hour, then place that caeser on a stone, and take away the mirthstone and extend his mouth, and lift it off, and press down the part lower of his belly with a gentle compression, as long as it will forget its pain.
Eventually, if the wound becomes infected, lying on one of your hands. Make the reduction of his hand, but if you cannot reduce it, then elevate the woman and make her go there.
If it cannot be done there, then place a splint over the limb, and concentrate on compressing the swellings with violent pressure, and administer liniments which you recommended.
If the inflammation has returned, then place that plaster on chees cloth, and study the reduction of the hand, and sew the wound according to the natural figure, and have the woman lie down and command him to compress himself until it is forgotten.
The body of the man was stretched out on the table, and his skin was pulled taut over his chest. So that the midwife might have hold of the man's hand and gently turn it over, bit by bit, and make it easier.
And as to how and when the umbilical cord is tied, and then pause on the neck of him, where it has been wrapped with oil and cloth.
And after that, command him to pull the cord little by little, and when you have done so, take away that cut on the cheek, and command him to lean on his left side, and command him to press down, and make that swelling go. The outcome of the prepared fetus lies above.
When they draw out the horror of the mother in this manner, consider, and then insert your finger into the second joint between the thumb and index finger, so that it is evacuated of humidity.
And if the fetus is suspended over the face and his chest, then insert that of the umbilicus, so that it may not be retained and he may not die.
And then you should push the foot into its proper position before placing that second one, and instruct the woman to compress it sometimes, and the servant forgets about the ease of movement, if God or fate permits.
Outcome of twin births or many fetuses. Be aware that twins born in motion are rare, and sometimes three or four, but this is strange and hard to understand; yet there are causes due to nature, and not living.
Consider those too, whether they are multiple births, a second child, and separate by the navel, distinguishing each from the other in the ligament at the navel of each; sometimes they are forgotten like a fetus due to natural ease, and sometimes they are tied up like a criminal.
And if they are difficult to deliver, make the delivery happen and proceed according to what has been said about unnatural figures; sometimes, as has been recounted.
And if the midwife is subtle and skillful enough to make this happen with ease and subtlety, and makes it slow so that she can follow all the figures according to her preparation, leading to safety.
Remembrance of what is formed in the womb from embryos and are aborted.
Some occur in the uterus one, two, three, four, and five, and six, and seven, and others up to ten, because a woman has had seven abortions or gotten pregnant again, whereas another has nine, which is caused by the measurement of wise physicians.
And it is also known in the science of the midwife that when the woman's stomach resembles this shape, then pause and observe her closely.
Chapter 76.
On the removal of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus in this manner, as has been said in the division of medication, and it is not outside the womb, then consider using an operation on its mother, because then take care that you choose what seems most proper for the woman, considering whether she has a good fortune or not being affected by any accident through which she suffers loss.
And then consider that the woman should be covered with linen over her belly, and her breasts should be raised up, and her thighs brought together.
The minister should hold that in two parts or tied to the left for so that his body does not expand due to the extraction of the fetus.
And that you should moisten the mouth of the patient with olive oil and honey, and mucilage from altitude and fenugreek, and seed of it.
And that the midwife should place her hand with those oils and mucilages, and should insert her finger into the ease of the mouth, and should circle around the area where the fingers are in the fetus.
In those places it is convenient: where you consider the fetus to be prepared, then you stretch out over his head, and then your fingers in his hands, or in the neck, or in the mouth, or on the palate, or along his beard, or in the fissures of his chest, or in his armpits, or on his sides.
But if you stretch out over his feet, then in the toes or in the middle of his back.
And that you should have the finger in the straight line, and pause the curvature of him in that place which is between the fingers of his right hand, and insert your finger into ease and put the finger in one of those places which are said to be there, until it reaches the cause of the boy.
Appraise and place it in the corresponding position with another lancet or the third if necessary, so that it is drawn inward and not extended according to its curvature alone.
And make it entire, so that the swelling of him is alleviated as it is done in teeth, due to the eradication of him.
And consider that there is something between them that the extension is softened; and if any part of it is retained, then know that the midwife will anoint her fingers with oil and insert those in order to release that which is retained.
Therefore if the part of the foot is forgotten, then the lancet will be put into the place where it is more so; and thus inserted until all the foot is forgotten.
But if the hand is protruded before the other and cannot be reduced by the constriction of it, then know that a cloth should be wrapped around it; and thus pulled out until all is forgotten, and inserted into either the hand or the elbow.
The translated text reads: And there was also a covering on the other side and on both feet.
When the head of the foot is large, or there is an injury to the heel or it has too much water on it, then cover that there is something between the spines of the spatula and cut off the head and extract the water, or what disapproves one instrument which is called "alundat", the form of which will come in the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter which is suitable to this.
Similarly, if the foot has a large head by nature: and then cover that with an iron tool, or take out the water from it as we have said; and place the bones with the forceps.
And if the heel is swollen and injured, then let the clasp be cut open so that the humidity which is in the foot can be dispersed.
But if it is not complicated, or does not obey the swelling, then you will open up the heel as soon as possible.
And if the belly's discharge is warty or has an infection in it, then cover that you will perforate it where the humidity is in it.
When it is on the feet, the attraction of that humor is lighter and its direction to the mouth of the vein is lighter.
But if it is constricted in the belly and foot, then cover that area with a bandage which you have wrapped around your hand, and cut through the belly and foot so that it runs along what's inside.
But if the other members are affected and returned to their head, then put the inner hand inside; but if the mouth of the vein is blocked, then insert your hand in the area between the shoulder blade, surround it with that hand, and pull those things into the mouth of the vein, and place a small or two uncinis inside there.
But if the mouth of the vein is constricted by an apostema caut (a type of cauterized inflammation that occurs on the hand), then cover it so that it doesn't rub against him; and cut, cover with a mixture of soft, watery juices. Administer plaster dressings; and follow the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
If the wound is on the side of the body, then as far as possible, pierce it with an awl and apply to what we have said in the live treatment.
If this is not possible, then pierce it in the flesh and extract it.
But make sure to leave no further cause for secondary inflammation.
And when you have completed the entire operation, then apply what we have said about the cure of ulcers to those wounds that cause such complications.
If there occurs an issue with the flow of pus, then send them to sit in hot springs and apply the other cure.
You have already seen a woman in whom it was found that the fetus was dead, and apply to another birthplace occupied, so that the dead fetus comes out. It has happened that after long time the ulcer is found in the navel; and it swells within that space, so the abdomen begins to burst.
And I was called in to cure him, and treated him for long time, but the plague is not consolidated.
When you stop on something from some causes stuck in place with strong attraction, and you push it out of bone, and you have passed for several days, and you see one another bone; and I was too much surprised, as there is no bone in the belly.
And then you thought that these were bones of a dead child.
So you inquired about the plague, and extracted from it many bones, the woman's bones were arranged in her seven chilometer positions, and it was clear to me in such a manner for a long time, correct of one little arm.
And I did not believe this to be strange, but because in that there is knowledge and aid, and the physician's artifice uses his hand for healing treatment.
Of the forms of instruments necessary to extract the child.
Form of torsion by which it is opened up the womb:
This is the form of strong compression in which they are strangled, to which strangulation have two virtues in two extremities of two feet. This virtue should be made more subtle in its restraint, and done either with a cane or of wood.
It should be the length of any stick that is two fingers and the margin of one finger on either side, and the length of each is a palm and half; in the middle place of two sticks are two adjustments of those medical sticks which have already been set firm, whose length is the middle of a palm and a little more, and the width of each is two fingers or a little more.
These two adjustments are inserted into the mouth of the woman so that they may be open when you turn over the two prescribed virtues.
Form another similar one, even more subtle and light.
Is made of wood or cane, like forceps according to its resemblance in strength. But in the extremity of it there are two additions as often, and the length of each addition is a palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
When you want to close the opening in the woman's vulva, the pain in her feet will be reduced, for sure that is what happens. Open your hand with the instrument, like a screw or a forceps enlargement, according to the amount you want from the size of the mouth of the woman's vulva inside that it makes.
The way to turn it, which they called old:
Form of impelling with which is propelled the flesh:
Form of compression by which is contained the great head:
And it is assembled like forceps to which are the teeth at the end, like tweezers, and sometimes is made long like forceps according to this form, like tweezers, with teeth like those of resection, which are inserted and contained. Form of compression few:
Form of one-handed grasp with a spine:
Form of one hundred days have two turns:
Form of a scimitar that has two extremities with which the head is cut off:
Form of two scimitars crossed:
All those instruments are exercised, and when they are multiplied in number and the species of that instrument are prepared by the artisans, so it becomes easier to his operation and less burdensome for men because of its quantity.
And not only the operation of those instruments is useful, but also how to equip yourself, because the necessity of those does not excuse it.
Of the extraction of the second tooth.
When the second tooth is retained by the infant, as soon as you command the child to swallow its ale, and place that stork with conditions, and press your hand on the mouth of him and on his nose, if so it is outside, yes.
If need be, then take a poultice and pierce into the covering with a thorn and pause in that herb over the mouth of the belly, thus cooling and soothing and calming and rubbing and applying annet and camamilla and scicados Arabic and cassia lignea and santura. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water on the poultice, and place that over the fire.
And place a tube made of burlap in the mouth of the belly, and hold that there until the evaporation comes to the cavity of the belly.
And place that stitch as they have said, and the second string forgotten quickly.
However, if this cure does not work and it is not effective, then you command the midwife to submerge her left hand in oil sesame or in the mastication of high altitude, and place that inside the conch with those stitches, and when she has found it, then take the one out little by little. May be attached in the pouch of the belly, then insert her left hand according to what has been recorded, and when you have found the second stitch, extract it little by little according to the order specified so that the belly does not rupture due to excessive tension. Widen the cover so that it can be attached to both right and left sides easily.
If the mouth of the vein is constricted, we already have recorded the cure with cauterization and medicine for the swelling caused by the herb.
But if it is not forgotten all the causes that have been recorded, then pay attention so as not to tire yourself on that in every iteration of abstraction, but rather cover that it comes out through the mouth of the vein into the woman's cavity, and let it be crushed with a needle and tetrafirament; because that will make it dissolved after several days and disappear.
But when you pour it out, it is because the humors are raised to the head and stomach, and this leads to the illness; and therefore cover that certain fumes and conveniences be administered with it.
But acute pains are already treated with sub-fumigation of nitrous torre (likely a misspelling of "nirtos" or "nitrus") and dry figs.
The treatment of women for menstrual retention and second menstruation requires a special instrument.
Whether it is done with a vein or an artery.
And the small extremity is pinched at the joint and the large extremity is pinched over the focus, and the sub-inflammation is stopped over the arm of the focus.
And hold that while it is consumed, that sub-inflammation, and iterate another.
Of the treatment of the unbroken anus of an infant.
Mothers who have given birth and their children's anuses are not perforated, which were previously pinched subtley and cautiously. Therefore the mother who has not yet perforated her own anus shall do so, or if she cannot, then perforate it with a sharp instrument, and guard that it does not touch the skin.
And place over that inserted linen in wine and oil, and cure that same insertion until it is revealed.
If you are afraid that it is a madness, then pause for 20 days in the treatment of the canal, and stop when the child wants to be weaned.
And it also happens that madness of the anus occurs due to consolidation of plague or of phlegm; therefore, if that consolidation is discovered, and we have said about the cure as well as the lead.
The curing of anal fistulas which are left behind.
Fistulas that are left behind in the parting leave behind a low, swollen node and a big swelling which occurs either outside the anus or in the space of one part.
It is a fistula or many nodules.
And when that node is old and runs from the humid, white pus or fine mucus, and sometimes some penetrate.
And those that penetrate are noticeable because of this, where it is expelled from the same by the egress and ventilation; and some treat with the cough of egress, and the fever is heavy to be expelled from those worms.
There are fistulas sometimes found in the space penetrating into the bladder and into the flesh of the vulva, and there are those that penetrate into the joint of the thigh and into the navel of the groin.
It is known that there are two types of fistulas: one that penetrates into the anus and does not penetrate at all, because you place your own finger in the rectum and gently try to insert or remove an object from the fistula when it is not too tight.
But if it is too tight, then you insert gently a lead or the hair of a horse into it until you feel the lead or the hair in your finger.
If you do not feel anything at all and do not proceed with the treatment of any cause of evacuation or worm or windiness, then as has been said, it is known that it is non-penetrating, and therefore you should cure it.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the flesh of the vulva, it is known that its meaning is to release urine from that place and prohibit it so that the affected location may be consolidated by medicine.
Joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And in all those fistulas that penetrate is not a cure for the whole, and the cure of those is hard work and fatigue of the doctors over which we are silent.
But in that which is not penetrating and is not old, cure has good hope according to what you have told me, and it was before this.
And so the disease draws between your fingers over the man's two wounds and elevates his blankets into them, the couches are inclined to the belly of him, and you should insert a poultice or an ointment, or put it in the fistula if there is turpitude, until you know where the poultice passes.
If that pain surrounds the navel, then you should cover with your own spit in the navel.
If you sit on the poultice because it has penetrated through your own defecation, then also if you sit between your spit and that fistula, at first knowing for certain that it is penetrating; and then do not work in that one, as it does not cure, as they have said.
The phrase means: But some said that it was good for some people, Tart.
It is expected to be treated with a subtle cauterization according to the size of the fistula, as previously stated, and inserted into the fistula until it reaches the vein; and then repeat it two or three times until you know that those adjusted muscles are fully tightened and stuffed into fistulas that look like reed feathers.
And after curing the one wrapped in calgunas, enveloped in border, until they scan all those muscles that are tightened, and cure another with medicine, causing and consolidating the flesh; if it is healed, then so is good; but if not, then it is not cured at any time for another remedy.
If the tent (fistula) tries to enter, and does not penetrate through the wall that is in your fundament, between that one and the tent which is a veil of skin or membrane over flesh or bladder, and at times the fistula opens up in this place where it dries out the surface of the cordon, then dry out the cordon from the beginning of the fistula, and you see drying out with the tent, and whether it is in the fistula through which the drying reaches the location where the extremity of the tent is, and by the tent it is released and loosened.
Cleanse those swollen and infected muscles that are assembled around a tube of pain, which do not break from any of those causes.
But if there flows a purulent discharge when you see inside those muscles, then afterwards milk will come between your hand and the operation, for it is well known that this should be done with an instrument lighter than the pus, lest it cause more harm or be too irritating to the humors.
Clean and dress the wound covered in suppurating pus on either side of the affected area, before applying a bandage to that spot, for afterwards it is customary to dress the ulcer with flesh covering tender flesh.
This is the treatment for which there are stiptics and excisions; when it is restored, it is already healed and does not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula has already passed into the rectum and is elongated on the surface of the body, then you will introduce your finger into the anus and ask about it.
Therefore if one finds it is a chance or flesh wound that the finger has encountered and is suitable for penetration, then there is no operation in it, but rather by the way of faith and hope.
The cause is to administer in three manners: either by cauterizing that opening as has been said; or by cutting that open which you manage to find the cavity of it so that it may be possible to enter the quality and the proper cure; and do not consider any motion by cutting because if you cut too much, you will insert those qualities into the wound, and accidents will occur over the malady in its essence, following its will; or you remove that cloth and expose that pus which you cut open properly as has been said, either to apply an instrument of sharp extremity, or another one, and expose those flesh-filled fistulas which are in the section where you can penetrate by incision. Some cases the fistula is finished in this manner: when you insert the needle into the fistula, and it's between the layers of the skin around the surface of the body on the cord and on the margin of the anus, therefore taking the needle of perforated extremity, which is as an awl to prepare the blood according to this form:
The body has entered that fertile enveloping wrapping of the five fingers or around those places; and they have inserted a needle into the fistula where it seeks to reach the cavity of the patient.
But if it penetrates into the margin of the anus properly, then you remove the needle from that passage in such a way that you insert your instrument into the anus; and you extract the end of the needle and adjust both ends so that each one is closed, and seal them for a day or two, and when more stitches penetrate the flesh, sew those back into place which are between the two ends of the needle and fit together.
And you treat the ulcer until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula does not penetrate, then you make it penetrate in any manner, so that it is ready for your preparation, whether by applying pressure on the perion, but not to make you do this so that you don't get infected; and you place a needle into that area until it heals.
The shape of the spatum spinos which is split at the fistula: its curvature being sharp and one part being blunt, so that you do not insert it into where it's not necessary, as happens sometimes.
Wound of hemorrhoids where there is a stain in the beginning of those.
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners, either they are in the shape of meat similar to that of bread, or they appear as if fat is accumulating. And among those there are small and large ones, and where the stain comes from those times it is one, some are flat, some protrude from the anus, and in the extremities of the body.
But those that protrude from the anus are according to the seasons of dry humidity, from which comes yellow water or a small stain on the skin continuous, and they are according to the color of the skin.
And the cure of that which is in the rectum is to command the patient to lie down, and to press into his rectum until the wound appears to you. Then you cut and suspend the instrument or that which you hold with your finger, and place the incisions where the razor is.
But if the fingers are not held in those due to the humidity of them and their softness, then you take those with a rough cloth or with a knife or with a flannel of wool, and cut out those with the thin thread, and place the incisions over some of those ashes in place of cauterization; or cauterize those as previously described in the chapter on cauterizing. Appropriate treatment for those already ill in another condition before they are healed.
If the stomach does not obey evacuation, then tie up the small intestine and cut it in such a way that there is some nibbling on it, and wash it with that water which is in the cauldron and obeys evacuation slightly when the illness is strained.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the stomach, then they are lighter because you will take those with your finger or take them with wine, and insert them, and appropriate treatment with that water in which they have been mentioned until they are healed.
And that who performs incision, covering how to stitch according to this manner: take a strong thread, wrap it around and insert it into the needle, and appropriate the hemorrhoids to the above parts, and make the needle penetrate deeply into the opposite part, and cover the two extremities of the thread on the affected part near the needle, so that it is stretched laterally; and tighten the thread and do not release the needle.
When cold humors infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Pause over the groin area where the disease is infiltrated with oil or fat, and pause that one too, and command the patient to hold still. Let it be padded with cloth so that the cavity closes up, and when it's closed, treat those with some application of poultice or another treatment until the patient is cured.
And because these are not valuable in that medicine, you should cover what is cut with the point of a spatum or with your finger into where there are moist pains and infected with those ulcerous scars, which prohibit consolidation; and then treat them until they become consolidated.
Thereby you apply those with the strongest pus until the first sign of healing and they are excoriated, and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that the lame person is clear, and it is not like if you see red on your skin, similar to a nail cut, and it is done all over the body, more in the lower parts of the feet and hands, so for those pains, they should be treated.
And then consider whether this is infected what's in the groove of the nail, and it's held between the fingers or on an lancet, and it's eradicated from its root; and treat that.
And if you want, cauterize it according to what is stated in its capital.
Warts are small, rough, punctate, round protrusions on the surface of the body, and sometimes veins appear in most children.
The treatment for it is to stretch and prick that one, or to prick it with a needle or through the skin into where it closes. And if you want, cauterize that too, according to what they have said, with fire or sharp medicine.
The small swelling is a reddish or pus-filled prominence on the surface of the body that moves towards the front, and when it touches, it resembles a bite by an ant, and it's made around the body.
The cure for it is that you take a needle made from iron or steel, and make it strong, and place it on the ant bite inside where it contains the circle of the puncture; then rotate your hand with the needle inside while you inscribe its path around the ant, and pause it in front of the flesh, eradicating the ant from its root.
And if you wish, do it with a needle made of lead or iron in this manner:
So that the passage under the needle is made with subtlety, silent (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that upon it the application of pressure will be avoided and the rotation of it.
If you want to cauterize an insect, according to what is said in the cauterization of athee [ possibly Aethiochic? ] in the chapter of cauterizing,
In the form of the instruments that are administered to give punctures.
Sometimes it is done with incisions of silver or lead, or by making an indentation with hot metal; and sometimes with small or large instruments according to which ones are administered, because that one which is administered in the treatment of small children is small; and those from which the feet or joints are swollen or inflamed have small punctures.
The large form of puncture is rare.
The head of the syringe above, in which the pouch is tied, is wide according to this method; and there is distinction at that place where the pouch is tied as many times.
And the extremity of it, which is inserted into the rectum, is mute (for it is not-uncouth) and makes a sensation to subtlety; and in one side there are two tracks, and on the other side one track, and the thickness of the track according to the size of the fissures and more thick one small.
The container in which medicines for horse's urine or sheep's wool are placed, and the reason is one palm.
It is perforated by sharp points as it was turned over; and if the space between the points becomes large, the size of that.
And when they enter those points with a strong point of raw flesh which is of twelve points, or on the other side; and adjust it to that area; and when it is placed in that area, be straight on the crest between two distinct ones with a strong constriction, and put a ligature on that point: But the quality of tying that point is that you press the bag of medicine, which should be warmed according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance; and beware that it is not too hot nor too cold.
And place the patient on their back, and elevate their legs above them, and put one cloth over them so that they are covered with men or a lance; and apply ointment to the end of the cautery with oil or with beeswax or with mucilage of fenugreek or similar substance; And insert it into the anus with ease, and have the minister take the bag and extract it with two fingers and press it firmly until all that is in the intestine is evacuated through the ligature; and then remove the ligature and lift the patient's legs to the wall.
If the medicine does not produce any effect, hold it for as long as possible; and if you lie on it for a whole night, it is more effective in healing.
But if you cauterize the opening in cases of intestinal issues and the swelling is heavy, hold the cautery inside until the healing takes place.
And if the hemorrhoids or apertures are long and persistent, hold the cautery close to them gently, using those same cauterization techniques that have proven effective on infants.
On the cure of wounds.
And you said in the division of the cure of wounds that this was suitable for the free man, and thus I say that the cure of those wounds should be done by hand and with medicine according to the complement.
So I say that wounds are diversified according to how they are caused, and according to the location on which they fall.
And the causes by which wounds occur are such as from an arrow wound, or incision of space, or percussion with a lance, or with a fist, or with a spear, or similar to those of other kinds of wounds.
The translation is: "But the plagues that are in the parts of the body are like a plague which falls on the head, or the elbow, or the feet, or the belly, or the groin, and seem to be similar to those of the members.
The translation is: "And I recommend the cure for some plagues, so that you can abandon this reasoning and rule over others plagues.
The translation is: "And I will begin with the simple pains of the head, for the memory of the composed conclusions will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
The translation is: "And I say that when it happens to the head a simple pain and not a fracture, then consider this: if it's due to a stone or similar, and only one chain has broken alone and it's a great plague and fears about that malignant illness of apostaema, caut, you should therefore get out and apply fleubotoma to the cephalic area immediately, and don't delay; and extract according to the sanctum on the amount of the vertu of him if not any other prohibition prevents fleubotomia, more so if the sanctum is extracted from the plague is little.
The humoral theory of the opposite side of the injured part is being considered, and care should be taken to avoid the patient's belly and bowels, as well as large food and drink.
But if the injury is small, then nothing should be prohibited as its cause, and therefore the food should be reduced and not brought near to meat or drink.
Pause on the wound, if it happens that an apostema occurs, apply caution, cut or press into rose oil, olive oil, or a substance where it is stained.
But if it is secure that an apostema has occurred, then pause on the wound, if it is new and the air has not changed, then apply small powder which I will recommend.
But if the air has already changed that one, then pause on a scab until it is healed.
But if the wound is great or is due to a space and similarity, and the lips are not properly adjusted for plugging, then adjust those with suture according to what I will recommend of their suture.
If the disease has not been discovered by the bone and sinew, and is not a retention of it but a small suspender, then inscribe that and place care in the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in its place rather than code, and command the patient to eat foods in which is grossness: caps and forms like them, until it is composed.
If you find rotting flesh in the bone that does not stick to it, then insert all of this into the wound and cast it away, and place care.
But if in these afflictions there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and cannot be cut with medicines, then inquire about the artery, and if you find that uncut, then inscribe it with a spatula or ligature; and if it requires so that what has been said does not give confidence, then cauterize within until the wound is severed.
If these afflictions are simple and small, then the cause of them is light; therefore make powder on those powders, which when consolidated, change the air that affects those.
The translation is:
Appraise the surface of the affected area with powder and liquid, and do not remove it while it is in this condition, lest it be considered an ulcer, which cannot be healed through the medicine until it is cleansed.
There is none of this alone to cut, unless there is venom in it, and you will not send it to the dragon.
And it is also done this type of operation for great wounds when it is necessary to stop them and straighten them out, and only for those recent wounds that have not been altered by the air.
If the air has altered them, and more so when it is in summer, then you will not understand the position of this powder, rather cure those with that which have been said, by placing yourself over those wet swellings, or over those flour dusts with water and honey until they are applied to.
But if it happens that the wound is a fracture in the bone, and it is small, then you will extract this by hand.
The treatment for head fractures in this text refers to poisoning.
Of wounds on the neck.
But if the wound occurs on the neck, it is not in the same treatment as head wounds, which are simpler.
But if the nerves of the neck are cut or an artery, then if it's a nerve, it should be avoided in treatment, for it causes violent inflammation, like thorns and itching, and is similar to venom, which damages surrounding tissues and counters that. And do not apply ointment over the wound on any account, for the substance of nerves is poison and their continuation leads to the brain, which is the worst of all the body members.
If it is treated with lighter medicines, such as cauterization washed with warm water, no scented or unscented oil is applied to the surrounding areas, and thus when washed with warm water, and other ingredients are applied around that manner, and moistened.
When a great wound is present, then administer stitches or close the lips of the patient, and place them in care until they are healed.
But if the wound has great depth or occurs with a lower part of the pus being expelled, then perforate that in the location where it is most convenient.
But if in the wound there is already an incised artery and a flow of blood has been achieved, then separate or dry that one, or ligate that one, or cauterize that one if necessary, lest it cause this.
But if already the vertebrae of the neck or all are incised, and the veins of the neck have been saved, then thus adjust the ligaments of the chain with stitches over the canal of the neck and do not touch that; cut it equally and reduce it to its natural figure, and set it straight again with a decent structure, and let it be exposed for a few days; and cure it with ointment in which there is stinging and inflammation until it heals.
But if the wound has already reached into the bone, then perforate it, and if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all that you can from them; and thus that which is not suitable to be sewn up, let it heal within itself until the wound dries out, and is separated, and the discomfort of it is alleviated.
If the wound is recent, then sprinkle powder over that powder which has been recommended to you. But if there is a wound with an opening or fistula, then cure that with this same water which you will remember in its capital.
If it's a blow from an arrow or a thorn and repeated several times in its depth, then consider that the wound is more prone to ventosis (air or gas) than if the patient has leprosy; then you know that the wound is mortal.
If in him there is no depth to the wound and the plague is recent with his strength, then place powder in it for the first hour, and do not press upon it so that it does not retain the strength in its depth and returns to the heart; but instead place a compressive substance around it, twice daily.
If the compress is not available, then place cloth over the wound to absorb what comes from the humidity; and have the patient sleep on the wound so that the liquid comes out tightly.
If the disease is not happening for three days or more, and there's no stomach spasm, heart tremor, or chest stricture, and other good dispositions of him, you know that the disease is saved; then cure it with calomel and another cure within until he is healed.
But if his healing is excluded, and it has been open for all time, then you know that already a fistula has been made; therefore cure him at your capital.
If the disease is due to a cut in space or bone, and it's simple on the surface of the foot or toes, then cure that with the same thing as before, preceded by suture, if large, or powder, if small.
But if already a fracture has occurred in the bone, and those pieces are already separated, then you will twist the wound to extract those pieces, if they are separate. But if they are not separate, then you will lance them into where the wound is expected to open, as their removal alleviates the pain.
The text means: And of the other accidents in the other members, the youthful remedy for cure is what we have already said.
About the stomach ailments.
The disorder that occurs in the belly is either great, or small, or intermittent.
And a small disruption is made difficult by another means, and it's uncertain if the reduction of them will be more difficult, unless you cut into their place soon, for when they are closed up and swollen, making their intestine difficult.
And therefore the best disruption is intermittent, for in that one it's not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is in the two other species mentioned.
And it is wise that the belly suture can be done in four ways, but two of them are common and convenient for other body ailments.
And two other stitches belong to the other wounds, but however they are more specific in the wound of the belly.
I recommend to you whatever exposition and declaration.
So I say that when the wound is small and there is no cause for the intestine to protrude from it, and it's difficult to reduce it, then this can happen in two ways: either due to the narrowness of the disruption as we have said, or because of the swelling of the intestine due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore when this is the case, then cover yourself by scaling it in such a way that you submerge a sponge soaked in water only, or what you can get in water with vinegar, camphor, and spices, into the intestine so that the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes this is done in which there has been a supputation, and it is better than water alone to resolve the inflammation.
And therefore, when you think the inflammation has been resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which is added alum and malva, because for this the inflammation of the intestine is alleviated with a small cause.
When an instrument of healing is approached with this remedy, then the disruption one little tool, to which these incisions are made on bloodletting.
The first remedy is better when it is proper that not it is cut off, and there is no occupation to cut off according to need and deficiency.
From the tool, remove the shape of it:
One part of it sharp, and the other not sharp, and the subtlety is not there, but be careful, for if you make it blunt by a little.
And therefore when the wound is enlarged and comes out the intestine, then cover it so that its return be according to its natural form, in its proper place, if possible on top of it, for it is better.
But when the disruption is wide and it's at the lower part of the abdomen, then cover that you make lie down on their back, and place their cushions under their head; and if it's in the lower part of the abdomen, then pause the head and foot more than the exposed parts.
Joint pain caused by cold humors infiltrating each part of the body is usually called gout by doctors.
And in order to treat this gout, one should administer it in great plagues and in middle-sized plagues.
And in small plagues, pause administering this that you have prepared, and place it between your five fingers, which will hold the disruption all over the hand, and check whether there is any stitch causing another.
This is the common way of stitching: take the needle, or count the number of needles according to the size and extent of the wound; and lay a little softness from the end of the disruption of the ring finger, and tighten the needle one, or so that you do not insert it falsely in both ends of the tendon, between both ends of the cuff, which is left free at the divisions of the fingers, as you sew it to penetrate that division; and you have already added two ends of the tendon and two ends of the cuff, and it takes four orders.
When the strong and double cord is tied in the curve of the vein, and sometimes across two parts, and you tie together the two lips and the wound for a more decent addition; and you loosen the swelling of the finger and put another needle in that one, and you bind it with the same thread as the first needle; and do not cease doing this until you have inserted all the needles into the vein, so that you may complete the entire contraction of the wound.
The needles are between fine and coarseness, because the fine ones penetrate lightly into the flesh; and the coarse ones are difficult to insert into the tendon, and therefore it is wise to make them finer in both fineness and coarseness.
It is not wise to fix the needle in two parts of the tendon itself, because the flesh would be lightly pierced and the wound would open before its consolidation.
They are not prolonged too much for stitching, so that the wound may be prevented from being prohibited by consolidation.
You should cut off the ends of the threads so that they do not cause the patient's disease to spread, and pause on the stitching with powder scattered from all part, which hold the ends of the needles; and loosen them until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
These small stitches are more convenient with needles in a certain manner because they have one or two needles on the stitch.
And the second stitch is common: and it is that you administer stitches to all four extremities, of the spine and two extremities of the chest, in one way, with an arrow (or needle) wrapped around the wire in subtlety and thickness.
And then, when the needle has penetrated those four extremities, you reduce the arrow (needle) from that middle portion, which started, in order to prevent the wire from rising further into the wound, so that the stitch may be a second stitch of dressing, with the dressings being tightened.
And pause between each stitch the quantity of the thickness of the small finger.
This stitch is known to men.
And this stitch is used to treat the wound which was caused on a man in his belly, which was previously wounded with an arrow, and it was the rupture of the larger wound of the palm, and was escaping from the intestines around two palms of the intestine located at the middle point and was the disruption in the middle of the member; and then you reduced that afterwards that the intestine had become free of the wound for XXIV hours.
The plague is consolidated in the space of fifteen days or so, and it cures him, and he becomes healthy again, and he retains that viscous substance for many years, and it changes according to its disposition.
And the other doctors had judged that it was not curable; and through a miraculous fire, because I did not cure him with the cauterization, which was in a place where cauterization could not be applied nor any medicine, but only placed on the plague wound twice a day, with abstinence from food and continuous drinking of honeyed water until the fire heals.
But I have heard two species of suture that are according to the narration of Paraula.
And so you begin to sew with the cord, and insert the needle from the beginning outward to the beginning of the intestine.
And therefore, with the needle, you penetrate into the cord and to those little hairs according to the rule and in length of the whole body, and gently loosen the extremity of the ciphac in which you inserted the needle; and then make penetrate into the other extremity the needle from the beginning outward to the beginning of the intestine.
When you will have made that penetration, then you will make that penetration in another way in that middle extremity of the thigh from the outward departure to the inward departure; and read the part of the ciphac that is in this latz, and make penetrate the needle in the other extremity of the outward departure to the inward departure.
And make penetrate in that very one penetration which you are making penetrate into the ciphac in the extremity of the mirror where the entrance is, so that all that penetrate.
And then start from this meteys coast and see which one is at the extremity that is of the ciphac in the other side, and extract the needle from the cord that penetrates, and close it up in that cord and sew the extremity of the ciphac that is in this other extremity of the mirror; and take out that one from the cord which is from that part.
And make this another way and make this another way, and make this one in another place inside where you sew all that which is outward according to that example.
The translation is:
The text means: The second kind of surgery that they call Gualia, which is said by Galen and for this reason you should sew the wound according to half its length, which the patient has felt pain in; thus you add all the parts together to their respective parts in nature; and apply the extremity of one side to the other extremity of the other side, thus it is done as I have advised.
You will place the needle in the extremity of your own side to that of the part behind, and sew it so that it penetrates into the part inside; then you take two fingers and apply them; and afterwards you turn the needle and it penetrates from outside to inside into the two parts of the suture.
And you will turn those knots and sew some of the parts inside to the part behind in two other extremities than are on the inner side of the opposite.
This way of suture is better than the common light suture, and it was also mentioned in what comes before.
This is a sermon by Gualia.
It is said that an incision of the belly is made with two needles, so you insert these into whatever part you find swollen, and then begin inserting the needle from this point which is your own, and make it penetrate through to another part, according to the stitches of those who have sewn their own guts.
And you will know that when a disruption occurs in the middle of the belly, the stitching is therefore more difficult than of other places in the belly.
But the treatment of plague is a judgment of other plagues.
Which cause is that when you acquire the plague recently and see the sanctum (or sacred place) of the patient before the air alters it, and then reduces the swelling and coos it well, and places a decent amount of earthy dust upon it.
But if the air has already altered the plague, then you place over that incision which is swollen and filled with pus, in such a way that they make a hard scab and cauterize it, and let it consolidate; and then apply treatment to it as is the treatment of other plagues until it heals.
If you don't have the medicines, then pause over that place for a while, as the pain begins to radiate from your arm, chest, and shoulder, changing position two or three times a day, just like it did with you, in order to teach you how to be healed before you need another medicine in various positions when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the plague will communicate in injuries to your main limbs, then cover yourself with linen soaked in olive oil of high quality or olive oil rubbed, and place that on the circuit between the angles and leave those parts.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in your bowels, which is usually caused by that, then pierce the anus with a blackish stinking thread, and more so if pus is penetrated into the cavity of the bowel.
You know that whatever is in the large bowel has a lighter recovery than what is in the smaller bowels.
And it is of difficult recovery because the bowel called "gungu" does not receive healing from plague that settles in its place; and this is because of the great multitude of veins in it and its size being greater, and also by the subtlety of the body of that one, and by its proximity to the nature of nerves.
If that is how you proceed from the wound, then the fabric and you can catch what has escaped, reduce it according to your routine, following the rule by which you push the intestines inside.
If it has passed through the space and already turned green or black, then how you strengthen that wound with a bandage over the location which is irritated by it, in order to bring forth flows of blood, since in the fabric are veins and arteries.
And now inscribe this wound which is another that is the inflammation, and pause two extremities of the bandage hanging from the departure point from the plague's entrance thus to alleviate its attraction, preventing the tearing of the fabric and the emission of the arm of the plague.
Reminder of the wounds when it occurs in the intestine.
When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then perhaps it can be restored to its original state by skilled people, because you saw one who was previously wounded in his stomach with a lance blow and had the wound from the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and made a fistula, and so he managed to recover and regain air.
When a cure is finally achieved which was not expected to be successful in the treatment of him, rather it was secretly done within that person who has been cured and the place has become consolidated.
And then I saw that the place had consolidated, time passed, and I observed the patient over him to discover what happened with this bad accident in his stomach; but do not suspect for this kind of bad accident nor look for any other harmful accidents in his many dispositions eating and drinking, and take him into a bath and exercise him on his limbs.
And we have already said that when the intestine is inflamed and it's small, then cover it in this way: and it is that you take figs of large caps; and place one between the two lips of the inflammation and pause a fig of those which already has the mouth opened over the two lips of the inflammation; therefore when you put on those and squeeze your mouth, you cut off its head, because it adheres and does not dissolve.
And place another fig close to the first one, and do not stop this way of doing so with more figs according to the size of the entire inflammation.
Return that part to its original condition, and leave those attached capsules in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and do not cause any harm to the patient.
It is possible that the intestine is tied with a thin thread which is made from the intestine of an animal attached to it, since it is more like a needle; and thus you take the end of those threads of the intestine, and make them bare, and tie the end of each one with another thread, wrapped around, and put those threads into needles and sew the ones in that part, and reduce them in the disruption.
This way of suture is nothing but a second means of trust and expectation.
But if the plague is great and large, especially if it's in a small intestine, where it is not merely a simple thing but a subtle one, and not healing from its entirety.
Treatment of scurvy and fistula.
Be aware that all plague and gangrene when they swell and become old, and if it's an ulcer, but not consolidated, and the arm is always swollen and not separated, wherever in any member, universally it's named a fistula and we call it scurvy.
A fistula according to true nature is a narrowed, hard, white channel in which there is no pain and in which the cavity is similar to that of an abscess; and for this reason it is called an abscess.
It is in an abscess that a fluid comes out, which is wet; and strong is the force of the humidity, so that the moisture is drained from the abscess in some hours. Sometimes this humidity is mottled, and it is little, and thick, and subtle.
I have shown all those causes, their signs, and their cure through medicines in the division.
And thus you should know how to do according to your knowledge the cure for fistula, which is made through an operation on the bowels.
You know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for those, some are caused by injury to major veins and arteries, or nerves, or the cistern, or the intestine, or along any of the ribs, or along any of the vertebrae, or at any of the composite joints composed of bone and cartilage just as if it were of flesh and skin, and those are closest to the principal member and similar.
Therefore that one of those fistulas is according to this manner is one of the diseases with difficult healing, and no cure, and occupation on that place is labor and ignorance.
But if it is one of those fistulas whose depth does not go to the mentioned places, and you expect that you will be cured of it, and you confidently wait for its cure, and you try to come to knowledge of it, then sometimes, taking a stick or iron, if the fistula goes in the right direction, and you investigate it further.
If the fistula is twistedness, then investigate that with a subtle lead, for what weight the lead has on its body is relieved and curvature should be given to the twistedness.
If the fistula is not having many horrible things, it's not to your power that you can signify over them.
Then perforate the openings for those openings, because the humidity with which you perforate that one will come from the other openings and spread to them.
And carefully inquire, according to which manner it is possible for you to know whether you have felt the nerves, and is the cavity of the long-distance fistula or the proximate one, or is a fistula to which are many openings and that is all over above with the sum of your strength, your inquest, the malady, and the cause of pain due to your compression on the hand over the place, and similar signs and causes of accidents at the apostema.
And when you have stood over all those causes at the station, then carefully observe the cure according to your confidence: and it is that if you consider that there is an apparent close fistula or in a salt place, long-distance from the joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of those places which I myself have told you.
Joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
It means: "But if the fistula is of great depth, and it follows the rules, then cover what you can of that in front until your sir is possible, and remove all the corrupted flesh from it; and administer sharp-wrapped medicines, and insert those into the cavity of the fistula, which you have understood to be a needle.
It means: "And if this is so that the sharp medicine has occasionally entered what, then it corrodes all of that which is rotten within the cavity of the fistula.
It means: "And place it again so that healthy flesh is generated within what needs to be restored.
It means: "But if it is not healing through that, then you should cautery it as they have previously recommended.
It means: "But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you must certify that, then you should inquire about it, dry it out according to what has been previously recommended, unless you prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or main member as they have said.
It means: "But if the bone is at your discovery and it is in no corruption or rot, then you should rathe it into what the corruption is covered all over; and place a cure on it there so that it becomes sound.
If it is not healing and the arm has become swollen like before, then you will surely know that you are not arrived at the total eradication of corruption; and afterwards you will discover on second thought and with great care the reason for it and the explanation of its removal by the stronger force behind it, and return to restore that.
Therefore, if it is healing, then yes; but if not, you will surely know that that corruption is in the far depth of the body, which has not succeeded, and then you do not trust in this alone but lay bare that.
If the corrupted bone is small, or it is to your advantage to remove it, then you will do so with subtle forceps that are suited for this.
If there are many bones, then you will do the extraction of all those, and for none of them will you allow any cause to remain with your strength.
But if there is to you some opposition from any cause of humidity, and in their origin there is neither fear nor error, then you will insert those laments or flesh as they are here, and deliver the bones.
If you are not prepared to break the bones of your hour, then pause on the plague that is causing it, until that plague subsides and enters into the vicinity of those bones of flesh and ligaments, and protect the wound so that it does not become consolidated, and constrict the section which you have incised in your operation.
But if you fear, pause on that place submerged in oil, or in the Egyptian unguent, or in any other herbal concoction, when they will have worked those ligaments, and the bones are separated from their abstraction, and from those attacks is alleviated.
But if it is a great bone, like the hip or thigh bone, and that of which it is corrupted is only the face alone, then remove it solely behind, so that you expose that blackness and corruption, and restore the wound.
But if that which is corrupted is a great division, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that one and inscribe it inside where the corruption has spread, and then cure it until it becomes consolidated.
I recommend to you that seek out another man in your presence so that you may place it there and assist more easily with the operation.
Focus on an old man, around xxx years of age, who experiences pain in his groin area, and from the torn flesh it appears that the matter is entering the body through which the matter is becoming accumulated in the groin, and it is a matter of large swelling, and there is no focus of external cause.
And then extend the time on that due to the error of the doctors until the swelling is stopped, and gather the moving matter, and his cure is temporarily postponed until the chamber becomes fistulous, and do it in those small orifices which all leak pus and the humidity of the body.
And then the healer multiplies many doctors around for two years, and does not know much in that art until you were called.
And I saw the chamber of him and the matters that were running out from those orifices over a great body; and already the skin of that man was totally stunted and the colour of it was yellow.
And then you insert a needle into one of those openings and penetrate to the bone.
And therefore you search through the openings first and find out which ones lead all over the body of the thigh.
And then you come across one of those openings that lead to a part of the bone inside which you discover a corrupted part, and you pull it out, and already it was rotten and corrupted, and it had also already infested another part of the thigh where you had penetrated into the marrow.
And then you see that this is what has been discovered and prepared from the bone that was uncovered.
And you find that it was not in the bone but in that corruption which I had cut open and seen, and already I had dug it up.
And you place the restoration of the plague with conservative medicine for a long time, and it is not consolidated.
And therefore you iterate and discover another corruption in the second bone over which you made the first discovery, and pull out the continuing corruption from the bone.
It seems to be describing a treatment for corruption or putrefaction of the body after death. The translation is:
It appears to be saying: "And then I discovered another way and did not cease inserting the small bone gradually, especially and carefully perforating the restoration of it, and was not restored until I inserted around a palm size, and that extraction removed the marrow of it, and then restored again with medicines, and was made strong lightly and healthy.
It appears to be saying: "And it is not necessary a repetition in the operation of him and section of him except for the arrangement of the gall bladder of him and because of its limited tolerance and fear of death, since he suffers from all hours by superfluous evacuation of sycosis bad.
It appears to be saying: "And therefore, the cure is for complete healing, and there is nothing in place of hard bone tissue; and it is done well the arrangement of him in his body and returned to his virtue; and conversely, he returns to his disposition and does not cause him any inconvenience on mobility or harm in any cause.
It appears to be saying: "But if the bone is found in place of the body, already having been treated, then how you cut that second in this manner: and it is that you take a ligament and tighten it at the end of that bone, and command all those who extend it so that they stretch it; pause that ligament of wool thicker than the first one; and place it on the flesh which remains with the bone, and extend its extremity so that you tie the flesh to the parts left, and you uncover the flesh over the place where you wish to sew so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Stop the cart or table under the bones, because when you do this it is not prohibited to press on the rotten flesh.
Cover the wound with a dressing over the corrupted little piece, because if it is in the bone's concavity and corruption doesn't appear on its surface or sensation, you should apply this dressing elsewhere.
If the bone is corrupted and does not protrude, then there is a continuous opening between two others, and corruption is in the middle or at one of its parts; therefore you should discover the flesh from all sides completely; and then apply a stopper to that, and apply the suture on the first part where the corruption has entered so that the continuity of the other part can be completed.
And if the suture is according to the place of corruption a little, as they said.
If the corruption is at a joint, then you inscribe that corrupted joint, and suture the bone where it continues from the other part.
If the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in proportion but rather in a way that requires skill.
If the corruption is in the breast or chest area, it will be more difficult; however, you should inquire how the corruption appears to you, and open that, and clean it according to any disposition which is possible to your, and adjust it as best can be, so as not to hinder the coming or nerve.
It is wise to know what are the cutters and saws to cut these bones, according to the state of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety and size and smallness, and hardness and rarity; so that you can prepare all sorts of operations with suitable instruments for each operation.
You know that this operation refers to you concerning the type of instrument you have chosen; for when you have had great study and long experience of these arts, and witness from various cases of diseases, which you already have here, what is suitable for this instrument in all kinds of sicknesses.
And now I will inform you at the end of this chapter, the number of instruments which you will use with simple ones in which you will proceed to your procedure that you will try on others. Form of cutting:
Another form of cutting:
Other major form of cutting:
Form of a knife or surgical blade: The head of this knife should be shaped like the head of a star-shaped key, and its points will have the shape of the points of the heel's nails.
It does not apply only when the heads of the joints are corrupted, or when the mouth is large.
Form of smaller knives:
Form of curved knives:
Another way of cutting properly: the arc of the upper part above the surrounding area and the sharpness of the iron, and the member of the knife cut down somewhat. Form of the knife itself:
Method for cutting in which there has been an indentation:
Other subtle cutting method:
Form of another curved cutting for extremities:
Method of small scraping resembling a needle:
Other smaller incisions:
Method of another incision; this resembles a splinter and the extremity is cut like a saw, appearing in several locations on the bone:
Form of splinter that corresponds to the ratio of one who is pierced with bones:
And the extremity is triangular, with sharp extremity.
And it is made of Indian iron, and like all the aforementioned causes for cutting, scraping, incising, and sawing.
Of incisions on extremities and of the sawing of bones.
Joint pain is caused by external or internal factors, or as you treat the corruption with those medicines and the cure doesn't bring relief, or sometimes the corruption spreads to the member that hasn't been touched by any cause, so cover that member inside so that the corruption can't spread further, for it to escape through death or malice which is more serious damage to the member.
The sign of the one afflicted is that the member turns black inside where it's been scorched, or if you wait for the blackness to be present within, then put an ointment within that member so that it can burn all the body; and therefore, count yourself in that person.
Similarly, if it's caused by the corruption due to a percussion of certain poisonous causes such as from scorpion's sting or viper or rattle snake, and similar.
If the corruption or percussion is in the extremity of the finger, then you insert the finger and do not give space to the corruption so that it can enter into the hand.
When you come to the arm, then insert that from the armpit, and do not give space to corruption in between while it takes hold on the arm's skin.
If instead you insert it into the elbow joint.
If it passes through the corruption and takes hold of the elbow again, then in that place is death of the disease; and administering another cause here in treatment is according to quantity of virtue.
Similarly do of the foot when corruption passes instead of the skin of the foot, then you insert it into one of the nails.
If it takes hold on the heel of the foot, then you insert it into the whole foot. But if it enters into the toe, then you insert the pouch into the joint of the toe.
If the corruption has already spread over the toe, then in it there is not pain but evacuation, and let loose the disease to death.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
It can be put on a sheet of cloth from all parts so that it does not touch the wound and comes to the patient with an adjustment and a dressing of cauterization.
But if there is an accident and blood flows out while work is done, then you should cauterize the wound immediately, or pause on it some powder that restrains the bleed, and return to your medicine until it is completed.
And you should tie the injured limb to its ligament at an appropriate place, and cure it until it is healed.
And I recommend to you this same medicine to one man in his foot, this doctor who recommends it to me, which is because of an accident that happened to him with darkness in his foot due to inflammation resembling fire.
And that corruption caused first inside the joint, where it tends to all of the foot.
And then that man prepares himself so that the doctor can apply pus which is going to come to the member with the violence of it, because of the extreme pain and inflammation of it, and the disease enters into the joint, and heals.
Long time ago, I studied that particular corruption in the said letter of my hand.
And then I conquered it, and so is myself subjected to reflect on that unnecessary thing which causes pressure on my hands when it comes to medicine, thus I have begun to remove the superfluousness from his body; and it does not produce a reaction, and began to go through another letter in which I began on his hand.
The danger made me to consider the hand of him, and I did not want to do this because I feared the reaction of that superfluousness, and more than anything else was terrified by the discovery of his hand dead, for the value of the disease was in its severity.
And then that he returned to me, was sent back to his land and came to me who that man prepared and disclosed his hand entirely, and he became healthy.
And I have not told this narrative but so that it may be assistant to those who suffer from this disease, and so that it may be understood according to which action is to be performed.
On the healing of wounds and quality of the clisterization with medicines.
When swelling occurs in fatty parts of the body and the space of the swelling is prolonged between the collection of pus, and it is broken and perforated, and the pus is discharged, and the place remains void as if it were a vessel, and the cord that lies on it appears with delicate drapery, and it does not lead to further corruption, and no infection enters into the bone or nerves or ligament, it is called sinus, and it is not named fistula.
But if the space is prolonged where corruption presses in on some part of the body, then it is called a fistula and not swollen.
And the cure for it is that that cord is wound up all around as it has been rolled, and more so when it is gently pulled out with a cloth, and softnesses that do not stick to the place because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the cord will adhere and that that corruption has not yet reached far-reaching consequences, and in the cord there is some flatness of face, then you treat it with a clot.
The translation is: And so you consider the sinew, and as soon as it's large, and the arm that swells has a fetid odor, then take a Egyptian medicine consisting of oil, wine, and resin to be received in small packages, which are adjusted in a vessel, and coated with fat over the fire where the medicine is made, so that it may penetrate the specific substance of honey.
And so you take from him the water that is necessary and dissolve it with salt and honey, then apply the medicine to the sinew, and strengthen the openings of it, and ease the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
And so take out that medicine at its price, and make it for as many days until the sinew is mellowed and the odor of the sinew is removed.
And sometimes you apply the medicine to him with water of ashes, when this medicine is not at your present; and so you take the ash of vitriol, and put it over the water; and after that, apply the medicine to him on it until you confess that the sinew no longer hurts.
If the disease does not tolerate Egyptian medicine or water from ashes, then cling to it as water and honey, mixing it three times a day, and cling to it as vinegar and honey mixed, because of the property of honey that it removes and cleans, and the vinegar adheres to the sinuses, especially when there is excess stiptic and dryness.
And when you apply this to some people and reassure yourself that the sinus is already healed, then cling to it as water that makes flesh rise in it.
And so you take a draught of infallible medicine and dissolve it with rose oil and vinegar, stiptic; or you cling to it with some medicines that I have already written about in the treatise on drops.
And if the sinus opening is narrow in which the clisteri's tube cannot be inserted, then you will enlarge it by applying a small iron to it little by little, and pause in that place wrapped with Egyptian or basilicon potion until it is enlarged.
And similarly if the opening is wide, then you will add the lips of it with a suture and thinness in the quantity in which the addition of the clisteri is made.
If the orifice of his arm from which it runs is elevated at the parts above, then dry it in the lowest part where it runs into others, because when the arm is restricted in the curvature of the sinus, the flesh will be generated there.
If it is not possible to dry the sinus into the surrounding bone, then perforate it according to what you wish, because then you will prepare the limb in preparation for which the arm moves lightly, as if it were freed from any cause of the arm.
It appears that someone who is sitting on a sharp object in the anus. Because knowing that this comes from the area of the anus, you need to know if it is an excess (mot) or a deficiency (pauc), or not a true deficiency.
And so I also consider the location of that sinus, whether it is in the area where the patient feels pain or not, and if it's an ulcer (apostema).
And with my medication prolonged in that manner, and seeing the matter that is spat out of the anus already adhering or forming adhesion, then I would often remove it on the third day, or sometimes also on the second or fourth day, when removing the boil, I would change the bandage for another one and renew the poultice.
But if the sinus is causing long space where the virus or subtlety stays, then do not despair of the adhesion to it, because the healing of it occurs, because some men have homes in which there is a delay in the generation of flesh on their boils, and those are also in whom it is done the contrary.
If the sinew is not adherent after four days and it's late to stick to it, then you know that the sinew does not adhere; and if the adhesion of the sinew is delayed and it's a prolonged cause, then adjust in the drying out of medicines, and if the medicines are dry in their substance and virtue, they become wet like a damp cloth when it is adjusted on superfluity of addition of suggil.
And the flesh that is touched by the disease, is that you take of the damp cloth and dissolve it in rose oil, and apply it on the affected surface, and tie it with a woolen band in its substance, and cover it with it.
And also do the same thing when there is no limb, damp cloth, or wool, but melted wax, as it becomes thicker, and use it; or that you take myrrh and aloes and crush them, and sprinkle over the melted wax as much as possible on the spot, and tie a line over the linen and strengthen it over the sinew; and tie the same one with the melted wax which has become thickened, and sprinkle over the linen and strengthen it.
A medical treatise is described as a "long and complicated" remedy involving the use of "aristologia longua", which may refer to a type of herbal remedy or a complex preparation. The ingredients mentioned include lily (possibly referring to the lily flower, but possibly being an error), the plant errum (which could be related to the plant Centaurea), and flour from grain that is not specified.
If the sinew is prolonged and does not heal with this remedy, then it is clear that corruption exists in the tendon, and previously, an inquiry was made into the bones or other hard parts, or tendons; then apply a fistula cure, as has been said.
The remedy for paronychia and ingrown toenails is by applying ointment, cutting and releasing the nail, and removing it.
A paronychia is an inflammation of the nail fold, which can occur on either the thumb or toe of the hand or foot, and if prolonged, requires treatment, as it may be a skin cancer, or has become corrupted, where it must be cut open to allow the pus to drain, and quickly cut through the infected tissue, allowing its corruption to spread into the bone, where it causes a foul odor, and is made by fusing together the extremity of the toe, and the nail turns black.
When you have already said that which was stated in the division and do not confirm your cure, then carefully cover that you have inserted all the superfluity which is broken of the claw and should cauterize the wound near it, because the cauterizing instrument is useful in this.
But if the bone is healthy and the claw is sound, and the addedictions of the claw have already compressed the flesh to the joints, and they start to pierce and pull out that one, then carefully cover that you pause a subtle ray so as not to cut off the angle of the claw which you are piercing the flesh, and push it in there and insert that flesh with ease, and rest upon it where what remains of the flesh is left after the medicines have burned away corrosive things within; and apply a dressing to that wound until it is healed.
But if corruption has already pressed into the bone, then carefully insert the bone that is in it and extract it, because no time is healing where there is corruption within the bone.
And if the corrosion and corruption are going into one of the joints, then carefully insert that in one of the nuts according to what is remembered beforehand, and apply treatment to it until it is healed.
Joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Miserable disease is that which is found in the majority of arthritic people, light it is for the flesh, and light it is in the bones, or light it is in the joints.
It is found in the marrow of the joint, or it is the inherent nature of arthritic conditions that were described earlier. But that which is found in arthritic conditions of the joints is not harmful, and this one which is found in the joints is more serious.
And of those that are found in the flesh, the section is light, and it is said that this comes from the spotted rash.
But of that which is found in the joint marrow, recovery is difficult; therefore be careful not to remove it.
But in those who have it in the joints, you need to remove the marrow, cover that with a layer of flesh inserted into the bone, and place a suitable saw over it, and cure it until it heals.
But consolidation that occurs in the joints between their movable parts or due to the inherent nature of the person who was born with it, or due to the consolidation of an ulcer or fire, or by similarity, then cover up that consolidation until the joints return to their natural form.
They will place a pause between their bed sheets of the medicated oil in rose oil so that they are not lightly consolidated and, separating them, or placing one sheet over another with a thin piece of lead inside to consolidate as desired.
Similarly, if consolidation occurs in the joints of the palm, it is then dried off according to how it was prepared and brought into shape for the figure of the limb.
From the beginning of vices, they are varicose veins.
Vices are varicose veins, and they are wrapped, swollen veins filled with superfluous melancholic matter which flow in the muscles of the body, and the greatest event of their occurrence is between the thighs, and most frequently in the intercourses, laborers', and porters' thighs.
Therefore, it is known that you should administer purgation of the black bile from the body, sometimes with strong expulsion, and place blood into the patient's basilic vein.
But their cure is in two manners: the one is that they are sliced and the black bandage is placed, and the other manner is that the vein is elevated and it is completely removed.
The section of the patient is done in this manner: fixate the cushion with cold water inside it before the big belly is resolved, which is feculent from the cushion, and fasten the patient's belly to the top more superior than the opening into the space behind one, and fasten a band on one end of the disease, and dry the vein in one or two or three sections wide, and fasten the black cloth with the tied hand of the cushion inside into its, and outwards, until the medicine is gone and you have taken as much as you want and how often.
And fasten that one, and command him to abstain from the black-colored foods that generate inflammation.
And iterate the cure by flebotomy when the veins are full and this is noticed by the disease.
Perhaps the elevation of it is done in this manner: you who fixate the patient's belly, if his bowels are loose, and fasten him with a band, then fixate the belly with cold water until he becomes crimson and the veins swell; or if he is exercised too much, if bathing is not at your presence, until the member is scaled.
Close the tendon in the third finger of the vein by cutting it in the long or short end or at its lowest point, where it is necessary to make it not painful.
Close the tendon with an overhand knot and excise the vein all through its entire thickness where it appears to cause pain, since that is when the appearance of the ulcer declines towards blackness.
Thereafter cut away from that white knot on both sides of the cord.
Place the intestine in that place so it is elevated and pulled back against the tendon, and suspend it with an onion or leech.
Close another incision opposite that incision for three fingers, and excise the tendon from the beginning of it up to the vein where you appear.
Elevate that and incise it in the third section of the foot, and close that and elevate that where it is protruded by the second section, and close that one over that one.
When the joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If you do not obey my orders to extract and elevate, then insert an arrow-shaped needle into the flesh with two threads of strong twine, tie it off, and extract it, or insert another one into the flesh and turn your hand to all parts until it is drawn out. Be careful not to insert it too far; for if it breaks, it will be difficult to elevate that part and the patient's condition will become even worse.
And when that part is completely exposed, then pause on the site of the plague a woolen cloth immersed in vinegar and sweet oil, and apply that treatment until it heals.
And if the flesh is contracted and twisted to the extent that it involves the parts, and does not follow the straight course as stated, then cover that part with cuts over the entire range of its twisting, and suspend that with a needle until you elevate all of it.
Be careful of your section that does not cut the vein and does not cause pain to it, because it will be difficult for you to lift it; and serve your prudence in that matter.
Shape of the incision by which the vein is cut:
It is not on a sensitive area like an ulcer or a sharp extremity so that it causes pain to the vein; and its thickness is large, because if it were subtle, it would cut the vein by its subtlety; therefore there are thick areas over it as we have said.
Of removal of the vein from the thigh.
This vein is generated in the thighs on lowlands, like Atigi in the land of Arabs and in the lands of India, dry and barren with little strength, where there is neither grass nor hay.
It is lighter in other parts of the body, besides the thighs.
And its growth is of putrefaction, which leaves behind a cord, like the venom of serpents and worms and scorpions and worms that generate between the cord and the flesh.
The initial symptoms of the development of this illness appear in the vein that occurs in the groin, inflammation of which, if left untreated, causes the vein to burst from that inflammation, resembling a boil.
And when it appears on the limb, then cover that one with a leaden cloth of which is its weight like that of an iron drag; and do not disturb the leaden cloth suspended from the groin.
And thus many times, when it comes to the limbs, there is no cause outside, cover it with lead and do not touch. And if it is prolonged, then you inscribe one of the limbs and cover the remaining part; and do not inscribe that one until it has come out, for if you inscribe it while it is inside, it contracts and enters into the flesh, causing an apoplexy and purulence in the place and ulceration foul.
So cover that it be treated gradually and extracted little by little, until it is completely freed from the root of the limb and there is no remaining cause in the body.
It is settled in three finger spaces that one must be of 2 palms length and there are already people who have reached this measure.
If it is inserted at the time of its medication, then one must insert the rod in the vein and pierce that long tract through the body, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer putrefaction to the place for three days with medicines; and then treat it by the treatment of apostems.
This vein sometimes has certain knots, and more frequently when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and comes to it with many boils, and is formed from each boil.
Therefore cure that boil as has been said in the division and with what has been previously stated.
From the cutting of those worms generated under the skin, and it is called cattle sickness.
This sickness is called cattle sickness because it often occurs in the bowels and is a worm a little more than one that is born between the intestine and the flesh, and rises and falls throughout the whole body, and is shown by showing its joint of member after member until it breaks through the intestine and comes out.
The translation is: And the generation of this is due to the putrefaction of some humors, such as worms and serpents and intestinal parasites in the belly.
It is believed to be due to the evil of him, for when he goes into the body and rises up to the head, and becomes inflamed in the heel, it is said that there is much hard labor in him and intrusion and destruction of the heel, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you want to cure that and extract it, unless he is accompanied by his usual walk and appearance of the limb, because then can be strained that which is on him and what is left behind with ligaments and strong constriction, and then dry out over him and extract it.
And if it is found in the flesh and you do not reach it, then you will apply cauterization with fire over the place where it resides, because the most feared cause is corruption of it, by which it corrupts the place just as we have said.
But if the disease has spread to the head over the heel, then apply a strong binding over the forehead with firm structure, and dry out over it, and extract it; because that illness uses medicinal arts evacuating bad humors, and should be kept from eating foods producing putrefaction.
The translation of the given line is:
This illness is called in our land fever, and it is the pain felt in multiple limbs, and it progresses from limb to limb.
I also see that since I told you this, it is something I should have recommended. You were called to a woman ill in a village, and discovered her breasts, and found a small inflammation in the vein's tendon of the breast, and then because it was broken for an hour, I saw that inflammation rise like the worms rising from the corpse, although less severe than if it were living silver when it ran around.
And then the pain from that place and settled in the muscle, and it stayed there for an hour.
It was corrected in the other body parts before encountering the other breast.
I recommended to my that it was necessary to walk through the whole body, as I saw, and it was too marvelous for its transformation and the speed of limb to limb. I had already seen this before in my own body, according to that manner, however I have seen more words which surprise the pain being transferred from limb to limb. May I not see this here remedy applied to women as it has been seen in men.
I do not think this is the case, but rather it's because women are from a different body type, one of small bones and exposed veins, and in this operation, that heat is transformed into something else.
It is necessary that it does not appear in those who are of delicate and smooth body, with veins swollen.
And so that you want the cure of this man, and the patient feels that pain, it is not appropriate to apply heat as previously said, but rather be strong on that spot, let him lie quietly and still over that area until that heat is contained, and cauterize that location.
But if you do not apply the same heat as before, then it is sometimes that cure is by excision of the body and by this expulsion of heat, and you administer those foul pills and the sapphire pills as well, which resemble them.
Of arrow extraction.
Arrows are diversified according to the species, and according to the locations of the body in which they occur, because it is their diversity that distinguishes them, among those that have large points and small ones, concave and solid; among those with three angles, and those that have tongues; and among those that have stakes.
Joint pain caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body and lead to pain in the feet is commonly referred to as gout among doctors.
Therefore, if you notice these symptoms, then abstain from treatment and extraction of the arrow, unless it is outside.
But the symptoms of the arrow penetrating into the heart are that it is located in the left nipple and feels like a hard knot, which causes pain and does not heal easily; and if you feel the movement of the arrow similar to a pulse and a dark stain coming from the wound, along with swelling of the extremities, redness, and itching, then know that death draws near.
And when the arrow has pierced the lungs, it is evident by the presence of bloody sputum from the wound, and the vessels near the neck are constricted, and the patient's color changes, they expire with a great spirit, and demand intense breathing.
If the arrow is shot into the covering of the foot, and the pain occurs near the small joints, and it causes great and violent pain and breathing is labored, and you cannot muster all the strength of your muscles.
If the arrow is shot into the stomach, and the pain is light and not very heavy for the body with no digestive issues.
If the arrow is shot into the belly and it has lodged in there, causes no wound, tear, or damage to the flesh or intestine that cannot be repaired, and therefore there is no hope for healing of the removal of the arrow.
If the arrow has shot into the bladder and urine is flowing outside, and there is no cause found for it in the parts outside, and heavy pain occurs over the belly, then it seems certain that death will follow.
But other parts are treated in the same way as the face, neck, and groin, and the sleeves and the assistant, and the joints of the back, and the clavicle, and the bosom, and the casket and like its members are saved according to the major rules when the arrow does not block a vein or artery and is not venomous.
I think I can help you out.
The cause of this is that in a person, there is an arrow shot into the lacrimal of the foot at the root of the nose, and I extract it from the other side, leaving behind the gray of the eyelash, and the patient becomes healthy, and no harm comes to the foot.
And I extract another arrow from a Jew who shot it into his own foot at the gray of his eyelid, leaving behind the lid, and the arrow was already concealed and could not be found in that way, but only a small extension to which adhered the foot, and it was a great needle among sharp needles of the Turks, with iron that did not have eyelashes.
And it is said that the Jew was saved, and no harm came to his foot.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian who had fallen into the groin, it was an Arab needle, and that is where its eyelashes are; then you insinuated yourself between them, when already submerged in the groin of him; then you subtletied it, and removed it, and the Christian became healthy.
And extract another arrow from one person who was fallen in his stomach, and consider that he is going to die by that; and therefore, since we have passed xxx days and no change has occurred over him regarding any of his dispositions, I insert the arrow into it and engage with that, and he becomes healthy, and does not suffer from the severe accident.
And I saw one person in whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound was fixed on him, and therefore after six months, I extracted it from the region of the crotch.
I saw a woman who had an arrow stuck in her stomach, and the wound was fixed on it, and there has been no change in her disposition over time, and she has not suffered any harm or impairment to her natural functions.
I saw another person to whom an arrow was stuck in his face, and the wound had become hardened and broken the arrow, not causing much pain or a strong resemblance to it.
I extracted the arrow from the king's person, who had been stuck in the middle of his nose, and it was already declining in its decay about three days ago, and the entire arrow was hidden.
I am summoned for the treatment of him after three days in the case of the arrow shot into his side.
And then I made a search for the wound of the arrow straight away; and then I inquired about that subtle tent or hole, and not [I] felt it; but [it was felt] behind the right earlobe, and thus I presumed that this puncture was for the extremity of the arrow.
And I expanded the place where it is located with an implanture in that location where there is a virtue of attraction and digestion, confident that that place becomes the source because you appear to me the place of the arrow, so that the secretion may be upon that.
And there was no accident in the place that the arrow had achieved; and I continued with the implanture on it for many days, and there was no new accident; and the wound was consolidated in the meantime, and the patient recovered from the extremity of him through space for many days until a day felt the arrow within his nose, and returned to me.
And then I waited on the acute medical plague corrosive for many days until it subsided, and with that I made a search for the subtle arrow, which adhered to the bone.
If you have adjusted the opening of the wound according to that acute medicine until it appears to me visibly the extremity of the arrow, and pass at my times with it in this space of time within four months.
Since the plague has intensified, and it is possible that the fleas will enter him, cut away those, and remove them, as long as you do not cease to subtilize and invent over that again with many ways of manipulation, until one day on those again with forceps descending faytas, according to what comes in the form at the end of the book, until you extract it; and return to restore that wound.
And the doctors judged that the nasal cartilage was not restored, and you restore it, and the plague is consolidated, and health is complete for the disease, and there is no longer anything wrong with him in any case.
And I recommend to you the quality of some arrows for extraction, because pause this regulation and significance on this that I have not said, which are the parts of this art and its definitions, unclear by narration neither understood those in the book.
The text means: The skilled craftsmen compare little and much, and when something is present on what is absent, and an unexpected operation and new instruments are required for the descent of the causes from outside which occur.
The text means: And therefore I say that arrows are not expelled from the members in which they are fixed, but according to two ways: either by attraction of the place where they penetrate or by the opposite movement of another part.
The text means: And that which is shot through the place in which it was inserted, or the arrow that proceeds from a fleshy place, and is shot in and out.
The text means: And if it does not obey the treatment of the hour in which it was applied, therefore cover it with a cloth for several days until the flesh around it is spoiled and the attraction and its exit are alleviated.
The text means: And similarly if it is fixed in bone and does not obey to the treatment, therefore cover it with a cloth for several days and apply that to the attraction and movement every day, and it is expelled.
If you do not obey my instruction after three days, then cover that hole in the arrow track in that entire bone with a subtle travel into until the area is expanded by the arrow, and take it out.
If the needle is not hidden in the place of the body and is hidden from sensation, then you will inquire about that spot, and if you feel it, then draw that spot to apply the appropriate shock, which are suitable for its attraction.
If you cannot reach it through the constriction of the wound and due to its length, and there is neither bone nor nerve nor vein over it, then feel over the wound until it is enlarged and can be extracted.
If you have reached the area with the ligaments where it is attached, then deliver the flesh in which it is fixed from every part with all the skill possible; and invent something about that, if you cannot do so over the extraction of the flesh through the fracture of the ligaments and the torsion of those areas until it obeys.
When you administer the extraction of the needle in any place where it is, then use your hand and forceps on all parts until you make that obedience; and with subtle subtlety, so that the needle is not broken, and is made to your difficult attraction of it and its extraction.
If you cannot perform the operation at your appointed hour, then lie down for three days inside where the parts are located in its circulation, and put it off until it is alleviated. But if there is opposition to the flow of the medicine, then administer what they have written about cure in its capital.
And guard your virtue of incision at the vein or nerve, or cord, and administer in all manner to prevent the escape of the arrow; and do so with ease, calmness, speed, and firmness as you have been told.
And therefore remove the arrow so that the illness is according to the form in which you fell, as much as possible. But if this is not to your power, then administer what you can for the figures.
But if the arrows that are outside are being counteracted by the other part, or if they have already proceeded no further to the outer parts, or you apply gilbositat to the extremity of the arrow because of the parting before the codena, and then you seize on it; and let it dry according to the quantity in which you take the forceps; and throw it away, for it is made light to fall.
The translation is: But if it is retained in the bone, then your treatment should be like against the contrary situation when the needle presses into the bone, and amplify to what you have met, and remove that.
The translation is: Otherwise, cut it for several days, and then iterate that into what is in question.
The translation is: And if the shaft of the needle is in that one, then you will apply that to it.
The translation is: But if the shaft has fallen and you want to administer impulse, then you will insert that into it, if it is hard, stirrup with a hollow cone so that between the concavity of him in the head of the needle and apply that into it.
The translation is: But if the needle is convex, then you will apply that with a strong stirrup inserted into it, because the needle is relieved by that.
The translation is: And if the needle is poisoned, then you will cover all the flesh in which it is found, if that is possible to you, and apply the treatment with what seems good.
If the arrow pierces the foot, or the stomach, or the bladder, or the side, and it is close so that you touch that area with your hand, and there is a risk of touching the vein or nerve, then stop touching that area, dry over that area, and take care not to cut into the vein or nerve, remove that one, and apply ointment to that wound if necessary, and cure that within the time it is healed.
To grasp with forceps which are applied to the arrow:
Are the extremities of their hands like those of an eagle's claws which are cut with a saw when they take hold of the arrow, so that it does not slip.
And these are the special kinds of wounds, small, large, few, and scattered, according to the quantity of the arrow's size and its swiftness, and the width of the wound, and the tightness of it.
You must cut along the limb to open up the concave arrow and push it out.
On the ligation of veins.
Concerning the ligation of veins: Those veins that are customarily ligated, which are in the neck (caput XVI), including two pulsatile veins near the ears (aliculis); two herbs that grow on the two temporal bones; and two veins that are under the two eyelids with one and a half hives called aspicientz; and the vein prepared at the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is in the extremity of the nose; and two guidegi veins near the neck; and two veins in the upper and lower lips; and — these are called algegic — two veins behind the tongue. Besides the veins that are ligated in the armpits (V), there is a cephalic vein, and from it comes the wild hairy skin; and the people call "the neck vein", silent, and mixed, composed of one branch of the basilica and another of the cephalic; and they name that "vein of the entire body"; the basilica is a vein that is tied to the domestic side, and is named "tunnel"; and among the common people it's called "vein of the stomach"; the veins of the arm, which are tied over the shoulder, are also named; and the one that appears on the wrist by visible manifestation; and salvatica, a vein between the big and little ear tips, with two branches.
When pain from cold humors infiltrates each part of the body and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
The veins that are near the armpits have ancient catarrhs, emigration, and ulcers.
And the quality of those ulcers is according to what I recommend: it should be cut at the head of the patient, and pressed on the back of the head in the place of both the veins are wrapped in a large cloth with good friction; tightly tie the wound of your stomach around which appear the two wounds near the armpits in two places opposite from the head.
Take the lancet knife, and that is which is inserted, and introduce those others into the vein in the cord where the flebotomy comes to the bone. And raise your hand above the vein and cord in the lower parts and incisions, insert the vein at the incision. So the length of the incision is equal to twice the amount of stitches or around that, and make go out from the scar as much as you want.
Place a strong powder and ointment inside that wound so it may be healed.
And I already wrote about this in the beginning of the book, its description and cauterization.
But of the two veins, arteries which are called templars, the young one of the flebotomy is to be left in its original place and not moved because it is a bad and evil thing, frequent eye pain and sharp, superfluous swellings on the hands.
And as for the quality of a good flebotomy, it is according to my advice: constrict the stomach and its colon within so that both veins appear swollen in the limb, at first appearance manifest, and demonstrate their polyps if they exist, as I previously said; and then attempt.
And thus you will elevate the cord above the vein to the parts described in my previous words, and make a flebotomy incision there, lift the vein upwards; and similarly do as you have done on the other two veins; and run off the sap according to the quantity of your necessity.
It is appropriate to release the swellings of the patient, and place your hand on the vein for an hour, and then pause over that spot and powder and strengthen those beneath until it is freed from the great constriction, and loosen those inside so that they may be healed.
And they are already preceded by the remembrance of them, and their inscription, and the attraction in the beginning of the book.
And therefore, the youth of flubotomy of the vein of the forehead is associated with flubotomy of the cephalic vein for ancient illnesses of the face and migraines and rogors and fetid ulcers.
And the quality of flubotomy of him is according to what you recommend to me, so that the patient has strengthened his back with a bandage in which the vein appears; and place the instrument which is called fossor from which this is the form:
Pause the point which is at the head of the fossor over that vein and percuss it in the place where he is leaning or in another manner, and loosen the sancor to run according to the quantity which you wish; and release the perforation of the swellings and strengthen those inside until they are healed.
When some types of opening are done with a leucotomy, however, it is not thought that the leucotomy should be like the others, which are made from acute extremities, but rather from another part of the extremity, and the leucotomy is performed accordingly, following the transverse line, where the bone is proper and light, it will break when the leucotomy is subtle.
May the young one of the two veins that are in both cheeks for every wound in the cheek and because of its wound from the humors pouring out, and on the face.
And the quality of the leucotomy is that the patient's strength lies in wearing a bandage on his shoulder, and you perform the leucotomy accordingly, and you stand over his head.
And the leucotomy is performed according to the transverse line along its length a little by a little, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the leucotomy is subtle, light the limb of him is fractured.
And let it run from the sanctuary until it is necessary to you, and pause on that spot, and strengthen it for one night, and remove it.
The translation is:
The translation of the first line is:
You must tie your hand with the levers to the foot using small sutures and make it run along the sac according to your necessity; and take care that it is bound for one night, so that it may be restored lightly.
But the youth of the phlebotomy, when cut too tightly and at the beginning of leprosy and other diseases, produces constriction and painful ulcers and erosive corruptions such as herpeteroma.
And it is the quality of that phlebotomy, which the strong disease leaves nothing in its own cavity; and the physician stands on the head of the patient, and the patient rests on a cushion.
And tie the phlebotomy to the long vein, making it smaller little by little; and withdraw from the sac according to season quantity or according to how often necessity requires that it be there; and make similar to another vein.
And release the ligature and strengthen both veins with a middle tie, so that the disease is not focused, and lay them inside the flesh where the plague is healed.
When the operation of vein ligation is performed on an artery, it causes small ulcers and boils in the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, and fissures, and also bad ulcers that are located on the nose and around it.
And as for the quality of that operation, it causes you to fall sick in front of him, and strengthen the throat of him with a cloth, and turn back the lips of him and look at both veins from which one is on the right side of the lip and the second on the left side; and each demonstration is done by the blackness of each of them, and it's more so in the circuit of those small veins that are black; and then inscribe one into the other.
But if you are in doubt about those, and you do not know which one is the cause of them, then turn your attention to the more obvious of them.
And make it seem like they are two veins that are on the lips of those.
When two veins that have released their tongue are approaching the flebotomy of the head to prevent precocious growth in the throat, and for the disease of the uvula, and other mouth diseases.
And the quality of flebotomy in these veins is that it prevents the disease from spreading between your hands in front of the sun, and lifts up the tongue, and looks at which vein has turned black, and which has not.
And then the flebotomy of each vein is performed, and beware that you do not cut off the artery with it, because those are arteries.
And the veins that are flebotomized in the neck are those in which the gallstone customarily occurs in all men, and the flebotomy of theirs is performed according to two manners: or they put millet flour or olive oil near the flebotomy spot until it turns black; or cut with the flebotomy knife, and call if it comes out.
Let the finger of myrrh come again and again, and it is fitting to open the concave, swollen veins that contain great, swelling torbats.
And this mittenotomy is of lesser latitude and subtlety, and it is fitting for mittenotomy of fine veins that contain subtle swelling of citrus.
But the youth of mittenotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: that it removes the swelling of diseases left on the throat and the bowel, and from this it dries the foot and the belly.
It is fitting for the mittenotomy operator, when performing that operation, to guard that place and be cautious of it, because if he leaves there an artery, and if he erred and adjusts in the puncture of the mittenotomy, he will cut that artery and cause bleeding flows, so that one does not mittenotomize a healthy area with a painful mittenotomy, but rather is cautious and cuts slowly as with arsenic.
If the basilica does not appear through a clear manifestation, then you should leave it and move to the other place, or try some remedy on that one; or apply flebotomy at its end of the arm, because that is manifest; and dry out that with flebotomy as we have said.
But if you wish the deeper flebotomy, then you should touch the structure of the arm at the place where you know the place of the joints, and apply a tourniquet there; and wrap it around the limb and dry out the vein with flebotomy as we have said; and take care that the percussion does not fall for some space of the location of the artery.
And when you press, with strong pressure on the ligament, then that inflation is inflammation of the artery, and therefore avoid it.
And if the flow of blood appears in the flebotomy as when an infant urinates, and the flow is subtle, then you know that it is from the vein of the artery; therefore hold your hand over that spot for a long space; and hold off your hand, and if the flow is cut off, because it has been cut off many times, then press tightly on the arm.
Protect the patient's anus from the cataract of him, and be cautious of it and do not wound it for a period of eight days until he is healed.
But if the wound is not opened, and you do not have medicine there, then when should you not be present; whenever it appears to you that the extremity of him is contracted, and the wound is torn apart; or that scorching happens from the fistula, and that fen it up, and take a half measure and apply that firmly over the location of the vein with stitches, and powder inside until another day.
But if the wound is torn apart, then it is so; and if not, then cure that with respect to the place of the powder that preceded the application of this cauterization flux from the torn flesh of the wound.
And it is difficult to open the wound of him in many positions due to the small location of the plague and the possibility of straining the arm.
But when the black vein is taken for flebotomy it is lightly to cut out the wound from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the body; therefore because it is composed of a branch of basilica and a branch of cephalica, as we have said.
When pain from cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body causes pain in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein in its length.
The benefit of the vein's femoral ligation is that you attract the humors of the head and relieve the illnesses of the limbs.
And this is proper, if you wish to perform the femoral ligation with an olive branch or a myrtle branch; because it is the safest of all veins, neither leaving an artery nor a nerve.
However, it is lighter to tie off an artery in certain cases, when it is not done on the first percussion, but rather do not notice the artery again.
Joint pain caused by cold humors infiltrating each part of the body is called gout.
It is done through flubotomy on the third day or immediately after the first poultice has been applied for three hours.
May flubotomy be administered, but if it is convenient and necessary to do so, whether at night or by day, in any hour and at any time.
It is not done on an infant under the age of four years, nor a pregnant woman should be treated with flubotomy before the fourth month, but those who are elderly and have passed sixty years should not undergo it.
If one must undergo flubotomy in any manner, it is advisable to remove the surrounding fat in front of the incision with a leon's liver, if there is any retained wound, so that the veins do not burst into the flubotomy of the wounds, which are purulent, and thus prevent them from infecting the main members.
They should not undergo flubotomy if they are suffering from jaundice and drunkenness, or are avoiding illness or intoxication until the wound has healed in them, nor those who have contracted dropsy, but rather that flubotomy be avoided by people with colic, vomiting, abdominal pain, and a swelling of the belly, as well as multiplicity of pains and labor, and all sorts of causes that dissolve the virtue, or body or animal.
Take into account the balance of humors present here if the patient is gross (obese), with food and drinks, and medications if it is possible to apply them.
Enter into bath if there is no prohibition or so that the patient can exercise for some time to balance.
Pause the surgery of the plantar part of his foot at this time, since it is near the third hour, as has been said.
Perform the procedure so that his foot is kept away from all animal accidents and pains, as occurs with anguish, anger, fear, and all other bodily pains, which are excessive work, pain, and discomfort, resembling those.
And in his own house, have the causes written down where it is customary for men to apply aromatics and odors and balm, resembling those according to the quantity of possibility.
Follow the surgeon over a cyst that is more painful than the original one.
And draw out his own bowels, and rub him with the hand of the surgeon twice or thrice; and tighten the ligament with rope and bind it two times.
The text means: And so is the tightening of an early closure, because when a closing does not get bound, or the binding is for superfluousness, then it is forbidden to flow from the wound; or it is made milder, and then it is forbidden to drain the wound.
And so is the tightening, where that which should be flebotomy is rubbed between the fingers, and the veins are inflated, and they are declared to the feeling.
And so is the flebotomist applying his flebotomy with a little of old oil properly; and he pauses his right index finger on that vein, leaving the place from which the flebotomy should be done, in order that the vein may slightly go away, and the percussion is settled because it is the one where you see the blood flowing out like a cord when the flebotomy is applied, and from those it is full of vapour and when the flebotomist pauses his application on that one, it contracts; and he sees the flebotomist; and the flebotomist does not cut the vein, and if he cuts, it is straight.
And therefore, because of this, it is common that the flebotomist be stopped and solicited for all these causes.
Appropriately make a flebotomy, but if the vein is found in one place, do so elsewhere; and if not, then you should leave it there for a little while or over that location if there is an ulceration, unless the ulcer is not healing.
And if the ulcer is healing or if the disease is spreading, then you should let it rest for a day or two and do not stretch the limb, because if you stir too much, it would bring forth an aphthous wound, nor go into a bath.
And if the bleeding does not cease, reapply the flebotomy.
And if the bleeding is small and barely perceptible, but you fear that it will not cease with the amount you wish, then reapply the flebotomy in that passage according to the rule, and adjust it a little, with cauterization before the ulcer heals, because an ulcer heals more quickly on men's bodies, requiring less bleeding.
But if it is already healing, do not reapply there, because it is no excuse for any reason; and pause on that certain part of the wound from the oil's split, because it alleviates the body's pain. It is better in this place than olive oil and other oils.
Similarly, olive oil administration in total flubotomia ( probably a venipuncture or bloodletting procedure) where the veins are cut, due to the prohibition of the cord, and Tyrian purple is mixed with aloes and sage when one of those is placed on the wound, as the sanative effect is subtle until it becomes strong.
If in the site of flubotomia a large apostaema is generated, due to many previously observed accidents, and more frequently in those who have not bled but rather observed, or in the appearance of the thin vein, then cut it, and pause over the spot sponge saturated with water and salt, a little powdered, and strengthen that for an hour, as it becomes dissolved.
And cover that with a cloth of the same size as the wound or another vein.
If it remains in that place for several days without any black or green discoloration, do not notice this; and if you wish, pause over that one cause of aloes and myrrh dissolved, or any cause of mint juice or camphor or similar.
Events that are often observed occur after femoral arteriotomy of the basilica.
So therefore place your hand over that one, and if it often occurs you apply pressure to that soft tissue, because that swelling is bad and evil; and then beware, for whatever cause of this they have said, because the healthy fluid flows out from the artery.
And apply a plaster to this place where there is an ulcer, so that the area may be endured, and cure it with another cure within which it shall heal.
And consider that you extract from the healthy blood according to the virtue of the whole man, and according to the victorious color over the ulcer as it appears.
But if the ulcer is black, then you let it heal slowly so that it may not become worse; and similarly if it is thick, then you let it heal slowly so that it becomes subtle; and similarly if it is sharp, into that you put the subtlety of it.
And consider that for one who is swollen and strong and needs the extraction of blood in a place, the femoral arteriotomy should be expanded and the femoral artery incised.
And in a person who is weak, do the opposite of what was done to him, and cover that which you extracted in many trips, and have it stretched straight.
The best thing to administer in venesection is the cross-section, not a puncture.
And this method of venesection is spared from hemorrhage and the incision of nerves, and it is therefore more safe and more saved than venesection according to latitude and longitude.
And it is accustomed to come from hematomas when performing venesection, and if you cure that in front of the venesection with a small dose of powdered infusa or oxymel mixed; and extract it from the wound in three times or four.
And if it is inflammation of the complexion, then take before venesection a dose of infusa in vinegar of myrrh or in aromatic vinegar mixed with specific spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar, or an aromatic and strong-smelling vinegar.
If the siphoning occurs due to flebotomy, and it is caused by drinking blood and vinegar, then cover that which will take in water, eat sweet meat and drink wine with a subtle odor; and use aromaticity on some person.
Use the other causes that have been mentioned in the division under the capital of siphoning for evacuation.
Whoever wishes to save the arm and dissolve the sickness according to the fourth rule, cover it with that from which the flebotomy is for a kind of evacuation, and the virtue of which is fire, that evacuates the sickness little by little, as much as the virtue in continuous days.
But whoever wishes to save the arm, and make it heal according to one rule, if the body is strong, then do so after seven hours or eight from the first flebotomy.
But whoever wishes to turn the sickness of the body in the opposite direction of the departure to which it inclines, covering it so that it may occur on the second day or the third.
The text means: "But that body in which it has not been sealed yet and is swollen with fever, covered whatever disease was within it once, and is filled with a large quantity of pus and the appearance is amplified until syncopes occur, so that you will have preserved all the conditions of flebotomia; and that you place your hand on the footpads of the patient, so that the body does not mistake death for syncopes, more times than five when the flebotomist is unaware and neglectful.
The text means: "And it is not possible when you want to release the arm and evacuate the wound according to the second time, if the orifices of the vein are already closed and it becomes difficult even further for the wound, then press vigorously over that area, so that the extension is relaxed significantly, because this is too bad.
The text means: "Hinder the bleeding in between the two flebotomies; or, if you cannot do so, hold back the intensity of the flebotomy by coagulating the pus in the vein's opening; or press on that area with Tyriaca alfarach, or sagzenea, and apply a light compression until the wound is open and full.
If the vein is swollen, then loosen it a bit and don't touch it until the swelling subsides.
If it forces you to evacuate the spleen immediately, and there is no excuse, then place the wound on that same location or in another arm, in another vein.
The "vein of the arm" called "funiculus del bras" is flayed (flebotomized) at the place of the bend or of the basilica, when it cannot be found or is hidden, because it is made up of those.
And the quality of the flebotomy is that the patient's hand is inserted into hot water until the clot turns red and the vein appears manifestly.
And it should be tightened around that limb with the strong bandage, and flebotomy according to the transverse small vein, not latitudinally nor along its length.
And let there be an open wound and also your flebotomy at the place where you are performing that on the joint of the hand a small one.
If it is forbidden to drain the pus of the wound, then you should iterate your hand in hot water and let the wound flow into the hot water until you have met your need.
But if you are in the summer days, then you should be exempt from iterating your hand in hot water, and just as much is placed on the body of the wound in hot water during spring.
And the flebotomy of this vein is saved more than all other veins, since it leaves neither pulse nor nerve.
And the venesection of the right arm vein is reserved for liver diseases.
And the quality of venesection is that you strengthen the hand or place your hand on it, as when you have placed it in hot water, until the vein swells and becomes well demonstrated at all times; and then perform a transverse incision, and if it is not immediately necessary, do so afterwards.
And be careful not to touch your hand with the venesection, since it leaves exposed the nerves of the fingers.
And now put your hand in the warm water and let it run over that area, because if you do not pass that area in the warm water, the wound will clot in the vein's opening, and it is forbidden to flow.
And so the wound is extracted according to the necessity of the case, because you pause over the vein oil and salt, so that it does not become consolidated completely; and similarly, cover that which you do in every straight cut.
But the remedy for the cut of the thumb, is that it is conferred upon the illnesses of the hand.
And do similarly for the cut on this thumb, as you have done to the other.
And the remedy for the cut of the vein sephena of the thumb is for the illnesses that are in the lower parts of the body, just as those of the groin, and for retention of menstrual flow, and for the illnesses of the coughs and ulcerous conditions of the genitals and old sores, and for their likeness to the illnesses.
Joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is commonly referred to as gout by doctors.
Wound of the toe comes from the accumulation of pus or deposit on the cushion, because it is more beneficial and less painful.
If you do the same wound on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are left there on the surface of the foot, and pause your operation where you made the wound through it, as if you wanted to inscribe.
And then it is a success.
But if it is forbidden to remove the poultice, then you must apply water and caustic solution on the foot in that area until it is evacuated.
But if the surgeon fails in the first attempt, then he should repeat it for a few times, as the place is clean; and do not fear the evil outcome, but rather be careful of the nerves just like they have said.
Do it in the same way as you did for the other foot elevation.
And regarding the sciatic vein, just as they said, it is located behind the heel, next to the point of origin of the wild hair.
The medical procedure is called flebotomy (bloodletting), and it's performed to relieve back pain.
The quality of this bloodletting is that the patient enters the bath, festine and strengha (likely a misspelling for "strong" or "vigorous"), and places its foot over one of four toes on a long bandage under the ankle.
Therefore, when it appears, you perform the bloodletting according to the course or direction that is possible and feasible, and it's better, either opening in a cut (inscisión) or cauterizing through a perforation (seccio), as long as the location is safe.
It occurs in the groin area, and if it recurs, and does not manifest a complete sense of fullness, you perform no bloodletting on that part, but rather when it appears in two parts of the foot, one behind the ear and the little toe.
Be careful about the nerves, and make the bloodletting run as much as you wish.
Appropriate the tightness and pause over the site of the bloodletting cut, as it is strongly recommended that the patient will be healed.
De wind sickness and of the qualities to use from those.
Wind sickness is of corns, or of warts, or of the vein.
Wind sickness is done in two manners: one is by scarification and extraction of a sac, and the other is by scarification alone.
And this wind sickness that is with scarification alone is done in two manners, whether it is by applying a focus or not.
And the wind sickness that is administered by scarification and extraction of a sac are 12 parts of the body, from which it is paused in three locations: at the navel, on one side of the neck above the right shoulder, and between the chin and the jawbone, below the mouth; ventozas between the spatulas, near the armpit; ventozas on the alohoster, near the heel; ventozas from two points on each leg; ventozas from two cavilhas; and ventozas from two couches.
Wind sickness does not extract the sac but rather from small, thin veins in the flesh, and thus it is not cured by applying heat or cold, like cauterization; nor is it known that wind sickness is done with a focus or hot application on any disease performed through repletion within the body until all of the body is evacuated.
If necessity requires provoking vomiting for illness or for continuous suffering, provide that to the patient at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle point of it, whenever it be.
Therefore when it is in any of those causes and truly it is at the twelfth or fifteenth day of the month, they command vomiting to be done more frequently than after passing two or three hours.
A complication of nasal congestion is that when you apply gravity to the head and then it becomes heavy in the belly. But I suppose this could also be an evacuation of the whole body.
This congestion is in the location of flebotomy of the head.
It is not suitable to use the one that is from a complicated congestion, or in which there is catarrh, because it causes great harm.
Therefore it cannot be used on those who are old and in whose heads there are diseases.
But on those who are affected by it, the disease continues over them is oblivion; and therefore it can be commanded to the congestor that he puts his hand in the part where there is the congestion, leaving aside the rest, lest there should be a generation of oblivion.
But nasal congestion of alcohol is in the location of flebotomy of the black vein and basilica: therefore you apply asthma, and constrictive breathing, and larynx splitting, and coughing, and suffocation.
The text means: And if you want to be careful about the windpipe, a small key, when it is closed, generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
The text means: And the swelling of lymph nodes causes pains in the head and eyes, migraines, premonitions, and pains in the roots of teeth; whereas it is not a form of basilicon fissure.
The text means: And if you command the ventriloquist not to press his hand with a scarifice, so that he does not cut the artery and let out the flows of blood.
The text means: And swelling on the chin causes bad breath in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and a similarity to diseases that are in the mouth; whereas they are not forms of alliceric fissure which are in the two lips.
The text means: But swelling that is made on the two spatulas confers catarrh, which is caused by excess heat.
The text means: And swelling of the two parts of the roots of the teeth confers youthful appearance resembling three types of basilicon fissure - fusca, cephalica; for that the flow of blood from all those veins is more sluggish in the flesh than in other veins, which are thicker when they converge into the three main veins.
And command the windpipe operator to not proceed too much in scarification, because the place is stripped of flesh, and leaves him alone his nerves and arteries.
And it is a wound on which the windpipe operator wounds over the shins and confers to the hemorrhoids of the backside and ulcers pus upon them.
And cover that you command the windpipe operator to make a great wound, and one of flint, because the place is of great dryness; and very heavy are his subtle stabs wounds and be scarified with scarification.
But the wounds between the thighs are less so by minute manifestation, because they attack the health of all the body, and confer old pains of the throat and of the great, and of the bladder; and provoke menstruation, and confer both diarrhea and emesis; and stand in place of flebotomia of two thighs, and ulceration, and of two caulis.
However, in some it is weak all the body and make to occur syncope on many men.
And of the wounds ulceration is more to the left, as it is for the wounds between the two thighs.
The text means: The quality of the position of the incision is that it pauses the wound at the beginning, sucks up blood quickly, and does not prolong the position of the wounds, but rather pauses those slightly, and remains there calmly, and allows the humors to come back to the place by chance or accident. The text means: And do not continue to repeat this and keep going until you see the location already red and swollen, inflating, and when the pus appears.
The text means: And then scrape and iterate the sucking gradually, and take into account the disposition of the body.
The text means: For that person who is of tender skin, because when you scrape him a little and not pus, so the location does not become an ulcer.
The text means: And command the person cutting to enlarge the incision and prick a little, and retain the sucking easily.
The text means: And if the wound is swollen, then scrape it twice, because in the first scraping, open the way of secretion to the wound and to its liquidity. My pains are caused by inflammation of the joints due to cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If the stone is of feculent nature, then perform a scarification on the anterior surface so that it may be expelled.
And later, when we wish to extract the stone piece by piece or a small one, it is necessary for us to perform a scarification.
If we wish to extract a stone, perform a scarification on the entire surface; and if we know that the stone is large, then cover it with multiple scarifications.
And the term of scarification refers only to the depth of the cut.
If the skin of whom is rough, hard, dark, and its pores are straight, cover the areas with a lubricating ointment; if it is in summer, use oil like olive or violet oil, or oil of almonds, or cementum of horse's hoof; and if it is in winter, then use oil of narce, lily, camomile, or rue, similar to those.
If the excess is great, apply, for example, olive oil of marigold, or olive balm oil, or turpentine oil, or anise oil, and to its likeness.
But if the syringe is from large pores of tender flesh, apply that it should be forbidden oil, and add to those localities of syringes its location washed with vinegar or with warm water of sulfur, or with water of colocynth, or with hot water of opium, and to these.
And that of whom the sac is from moist humidity, wash his syringes with vinegar or with water of myrtle and sumac, similar to those.
And of whom the excess is great, wash his syringes with white vinegar, or with water of majoran, or decoction of anise, or of chamomile, similar to those.
And cover the syringing with linen; administer it at the same time as the bathing for an hour or two, and let him sleep next to the syringing.
What is it that needs to be done to regulate the swelling of the swollen veins before venesection.
Since he who is responsible for removing the vein or has done so is choleric and swells with good health and inflammation, it is clear that if one causes coldness, then there are remedies such as milgranes acetosas, endivia, agre, laytuguas, secanabin, and julep, which resemble them.
And pause to their food such as pollets, meat of birds cut into small pieces, and cooked vegetables with garlic, which resemble them.
And that of whom the complexity is complex, that one should take in drink sweet syrup or syrup made from alecannabin seeds, sumac, and fragrant myrrh, mixed with half honey and vinegar; and it is commanded him to use little drink and eat, and pause his food such as pollets and canabir, fish and pickled pieces of birds and piquets.
And that he should drink more on the day of venesection and phlebotomy than his food.
It appears to be saying that you should give a patient something to drink in some hours at night or early morning, possibly tyrian purple, or musk medication, so that the limbs are comforted and the illness is slightly alleviated; it's not advisable to take those scalpel-like instruments.
These swellings which are caused by scarification are those that occur on the liver, and on podagra, and on the navel, and on the joints, particularly on the thighs, and at the armpit, because these limbs do not tolerate scarring on themselves.
It is not for that purpose but to attract the blood of a member, in this way as if you placed a poultice on the nipple when a person has a flow of blood from the nose; and use it because it dissolves the stagnant heat, invisible flesh of the member, in this way as if you applied it over the abdomen and navel; for that which refines the member, scars it, and takes away the pain, because you resolve the swelling.
It is placed over the swellings when it occurs in their opacification or pus, because for the sake of attracting a strong flow to their opacification and eradicating the pus from its place.
And in a similar manner when you place something on the liver and gallbladder, air should enter those places.
These vapors are administered in the form of warm broth alone, and some are administered with fire.
And some are administered full of watered-down vinegar in the stomach diseases.
This is why the vapor should be filled and made large, with water alone or with water in which there are suitable herbs added to it.
The form of vapor administered with fire: is the size of the opening of two fingers, as it was formed by us; and the quantity of powder should be half that of a fist; and is placed in the middle, at the location where it is inserted into the vein, the small amount (of powder) no greater than the thickness of an arrow.
It should be made from rosemary or citrus, with thick margins, to prevent inflammation of the limb due to its position on it.
It is in the middle of the cross-shaped cut or iron bar, where the candle is placed next to the fire.
And now it is this small windpipe, which we have mentioned before; and the little tube, according to the ailments and state of that which uses it.
And the tracheas of infants and those who are weak are different from those of young people and strong bodies.
And the quality of passing this windpipe over the fire on the limb is that you extend the flue with the fire wood decently in front of a small candle of wax, and place it over the middle of the cross-shaped cut in the middle of the windpipe, so that the fire be lit around the starting point, away from the body of the sick person.
And it should be placed over the limb of the sick person, and said to be on that tract which we have mentioned, until when they have windpipes and do not demand that they be told, as long as the vapor is put on that tract, the wound will soon dissolve.
It causes pain on the surface of the foot.
May be applied to someone suffering from flatulence, administered with water, without any cross or transverse mark, but rather filled with water and placed on the member alone.
And this is the way it is: When the flatulence is greater, all the better, for it can receive a large quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Bloodletting is not applied to more members than those in which it is impossible to position the poultices, due to their small size, like the pot and gum or similar to them; or on a member stripped of flesh, like the tongue and its appearance.
And the quality of use is that which you have found, bloodletting poultices that are on the flat bottom of a pot for preservation.
And they are laid on the day and night in water soft, so that they become famished, and that no cause remains in the belly of those; and they are evacuated from the body through the mouth with flebotomy and poultices; and they are rubbed on the member of the sick until it reddens; and they are placed on them.
And when they are filled up and case.
If there is a breach in the place with air, it is more severe in youth.
But if not, then wash the place with vinegar and apply motted water; and rub it and expel.
And if the disease of the sick extends through the chest cavity and is bleeding, then put a cloth soaked in cold water on it, and place one on top that will open up the bleeding.
And if the sickness is multiplied, then sprinkle vitriol trissed, or poultices like those for suppurative causes, on him until the sickness is drained; or lay poultices of boiled fava beans on the place, and let them stick to it, until the sickness has been drained.
And also, if necessary, repetition of bloodletting, when it is possible to change those.
And if bloodletting is forbidden due to suspension, then rub the place with sick recent blood or leave an arrow in those places until there is fresh bleeding; and apply poultices which are painful as soon as they touch.
When you want them to stop, sprinkle some powder on those a little crushed, or salt, or ashes, and heat it up at once.
And thus begins the process of restoration: healing. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is healing of fractures and accidents in bones.
Oh son of man, learn that these fools who pretend to know this chapter do not understand it and those who have never consulted the ancient books will not even recognize a letter among them.
And for this reason, the method of science in our land is hidden and I have not forgotten it at any time; nor did I accept it before, but rather only through a long course of reading the ancient books and studying their understanding, extracting the knowledge from them.
And I shall guide you to experiments and studies for the duration of my life.
And I shall here describe all that contains my science and on which is passed the most excellent experiment; since it has been reduced to you from me others will be freed from occupation of elongation; and reduced in shortening at the end, it will be shown in declaration's end; and forms there most forms of the instruments used in it, just as they are done by addition of declaration, as I have done in two preceding chapters.
First principal matter or doctrine.
A summary and collection of fractures of bones, considering those for which certain prerequisites are necessary, before we begin to remember the fractured members and their various types. Therefore, let us speak in the prologue of this chapter about the sums of the discourse; and the capitals with which we intend to understand them, at the beginning are certainly the works and the location where the truth lies for those; so it is you and they who will be able to know or learn these noble arts other than your own.
And therefore say that when such accidents happen to any fracture or dislocation or twisting or breaking, you should cover yourself with the same precautions as before, whether it be the flebotomy or the application of heat, or whatever else, if there is no other cause, thus as weakness of virtue, or that which occurs in childhood, or because of wear and tear, or due to great heat, or great cold.
And therefore let it be prepared in a seven-year-old stew of greens and fowl meat and crab-like substance; and prohibit thick meats and fill with food if possible, so that the veins are filled with all food, until you are certain of applying cauterization to the wound, and if not afraid of bleeding from the member.
And now return the malady to its first rule, which it usually follows.
And thus, when the broken bone begins to be restored, it is necessary that the malady should be fed with nutritious foods of meat and great and heavy matter in which there is viscosity, just like wholesome food made from bread soaked in water, rice, capons, eggs, fish, and beef, and fresh pork, large and similar to those, and this regimen is done to facilitate coagulation of the fracture more lightly and with less pain.
It is wise to know that bones break when they are in the hands of a man who is old and in his prime, but also those of the decrepit, for it is impossible that they should continue and become consolidated according to their nature by the dryness of their members.
But nature also adjusts and connects the broken bone from every part, without any similar cause that would cause swelling, where it becomes stuck and tight among the broken parts, until the end of strength and firmness, just as fire at the beginning, when no obstacle prevents its work.
And in order to cure this disease it is necessary to rest the patient's foods, foods which are heavy and viscous and gross, just as we have said.
You know that the kinds of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the members, for a fracture of the hip bone is different from a fracture of the skull; and a fracture of the toe is different from a fracture of the elbow; and similarly, all the other members are diverse among themselves.
I recall all kinds of fracture, exposed in their distinct chapter different from the others.
There is great diversity of fracture in itself truly. They are diversified the kinds of fracture of bones in their own nature; for it is done fracture arched elsewhere where it occurs in its star; and some are done fracture according to the length of the bone: and so are those fractures sagittal and stellar, and others coming from or not coming from the source, as it is made when writing is prepared, and is fracture with plague and disruption on the head, and is fracture fissure small.
A condition or torment unique to each person arises in the restoration of them according to what will come back to their distinctive places.
Secret sign of a bone fracture. And thus is known a bone fracture: it is the twist of him, and of that prominence and appearance of him to the sense, and so of him when you press on that part with your hand.
And therefore when it is not in the twisted location, nor is the pain so that you do not feel it when you touch him, when you touch the bone with movement and the illness does not cause great pain, then it is not a fracture.
It is possible that it is just a twist or small fracture, and at that point you must press on him with your hand and apply compression of the entire area; sometimes pause over him of the medicines of which you see remembrance at that moment which convenes to the place; and so be straight by subtle stricture.
And you know that the place where it is arched and not split into two or otherwise such things do not occur in it, because it has been completely reformed from its whole nature; therefore it is known that if you begin from your hour to correct it, having that to happen on it apostaema, caution.
If the patient experiences an apostaema (a type of painful swelling), then remove it after several days until it ceases, and place it on the ground in such a manner as you can lift with ease and ingenuity.
You know that the restoration of a wound and the insertion of a needle into it is lighter than when it happens to bone.
Place (or tie) it afterwards in such a way that what will come back (the memory of the wound) is.
But if it happens to the bone, then it is necessary to extend that broken member into two parts, whether it is the arm or the foot; or use your own hand if the member is small; or use both cords or one cord and the hand.
Now that is the position which you hold in place with the limb so that it hangs down according to its natural shape, while the broken parts are extended from the limb, then be careful and make sure that those addictions ( possibly stitches or sutures) return to their place in a way that suits them.
Be careful, according to your skill, so that it does not happen to the patient through your operation or injury. And make sure, according to your power, that you apply a bone to another bone its companion in such good forms as you know.
You can touch your hand on it, and if you ever find a different cause, correct it and dress it according to the amount of your virtue.
However, the forceful extension and compression are to be avoided as much as possible, just like foolish doctors who have done so in the past and caused an apoplexy or a stroke during their operation, or caused a contraction in the limb, which is what one has seen in the operations of their previous cases.
The condition of the joint's quietness is that I recommend; therefore you know that broken members are diversified in their smallness and in their large size and in the form of those.
And of those that are small like the arm and the finger and similar to them, it is customary for the covering to be made from a soft, thin cloth.
But those that are large like the thigh or the buttock, it is customary for their covering to be tough and hardened, because the hard bandage connects the big member with the whole part of structure in such a way that there is no break.
And begin by emptying your evacuation of equation, pause it conveniently thereupon, on the place of that fracture with three layers or four, depending on the member's need; and tightly grasp a small amount of linen.
And take it to the highest point above the fracture's location, and strongly hold so that the fabric does not lose its strength at the location of the fracture. And extend it to the location of the fracture a little, and gradually soften the fabric a bit at a time, until you reach one end of the place.
Take another cloth and wrap it around the wound, covering that part with the cloth, and take away from the movement of the fracture; and so be your operation in the wrapping of the stricture and softening of that according to what has been said in the first wrapping of those.
Pause between the wrappings of plaster or cloth, either the one with leather or the one which is wrapped around the twisting of the fracture, if there is a twisting; otherwise, do not pause in that area at all.
Pause on the other cloth, and cover those wrappings with stars fittingly from now on, if in that place there is no inflammation or pus, but then pause over that where the pus is present and where the swelling is; and let it be calmed for several days; and afterwards strengthen it with the stars.
The stars are made of the lower part of cane stick wood, and well formed; or they are made from a wooden beam, or from palm branch ribs; and so be the width of each star according to this form and figure:
The translated text is:
The translation of the first line is:
The text means: An examination of fine threads is not very convenient because you will not be able to assign them accurately to the area where you want, and it does not cover that there should be one digit between each digit.
If the illness is caused by cold extremities near the joints and place them in those locations, then leave those areas covered with wool or red yarn to prevent injury.
Some wounds cause fractures, and accidents disrupt the chain, and you will find relief in that area according to individual specificity.
You should know that not all broken limbs are straight on the joints on the first day; which cause is because the limb, when it's large, can't bear weight on its joints until about 4 or 5 days or more, according to your safety and experience of appendicitis.
This is the way of the surgeons with which the Ancients used to practice, who would place on fractures and dislocations and twist.
Method of emplastrure like burning to treat fracture, suitable for complex cases and mainly in women, because it's on which no heat nor friction: you take powder from crushed grain, which is the kernel of wheat that moves with the movement of the miller's stones.
When applying that ass, as it is, unless you rub off that same humoral mixture, and do not interrupt the application of that non-essential, subtle treatment; and use that one.
Another way to treat fractures and dislocations and twisting: the recipe for asafetida, lapdanum, acacia, enula, migrach, which is made from mill-grained salt, one of each type. from myrrh and aloes, another one; alochil, another one; all three are mixed with water or humoral mixture if the patient's condition is scorched; and use this application, which is good in composition and restores the broken bones lightly, and confers strength to the human body.
Another way to treat which you will apply to fractures and twisting: the recipe for migrach and almondy white on one type, from myrrh and aloes on another type; from acacia on a different type; from Armenian balm on yet another type.
All are mixed in mortar with the specified preparation, and are rubbed, and are softened with water or humoral mixture, and are administered.
Method for treating joints and bones separated from their location, and sewing on skin in those who have suffered accidents and are broken with fissures and fractures: take wool to sew and immerse it in vinegar and oil cold and place it on the spot.
This plaster is not for restoring, but rather serves as cautionary treatment and drives out pains properly.
Another method for treating a broken bone: take thorns of the fig tree and thorns of the wild poppy, and mix them together to make plaster.
Method for making plaster that speeds up the administration of treatment to restore a broken bone and when you want resolution for the remaining inflammation: mix the extract of althaea, chamomile flowers, violet flowers, wheat flour, all pounded and powdered, and mixed with vinegar, if the limb is not scaled.
But if it's scaled, then afterwards you have to clean that wound with cold water or with warm water.
Another method for applying plaster that is stronger in resolution than the previous one, when a severe inflammation occurs and needs to restore the limb: extract of althaea and sesame seeds, balaustre, melilot, majorana, violet flowers, chamomile flowers, all pounded and powdered, and mixed with cold water or warm water, according to the quality of the member and its rest.
Mayes Ypocras did not declare that a patient's limb should be placed on the joint to restore its health, but rather that it is made of wax and oil, and there is no other cause; and I recommend that it be set between thick and thinness.
Mayes has Gualia seen that limbs should be placed on the broken limb to restore it and the causes by which it dries out are like myrrh, just as we have previously recommended.
Method for applying plaster to wound and pain: mix half with beeswax, wool, hair of human skin incised or goose fat, and salt, broken into small pieces; they are pounded and sifted and become a plaster, which is applied.
May it remain so that the plaster covers and covers the wound, for I consider that if it does not happen pain or swelling nor is the bone broken, it is worth being placed in its proper place, lest you lose a joint day. And if it happens at that place pain violent or swelling or inflammation, then you remove that one in the hour, and take off its plaster.
Distract the patient with a piece of linen and a sponge soaked in sea water mixed with olive oil, then submerge it in the patient's armpit. And soothe that area until the pain ceases and the discomfort is alleviated; lay down the limb for one hour to rest; place a cloth made from wool over it, submerged in vinegar and olive oil or olive oil itself, on top of it for one night before being sure of the swelling will subside, and that the inflammation of the member will recede, and the pain will be relieved.
Apply that structure subtly and glue small pieces of cloth over the initial constriction, so subtlely that it heals.
But if the swelling, inflammation, and pain have completely receded, and there are no further needs for plastering or structure, then you will simply repeat that procedure as you did at the beginning.
But if it does not happen to the member any other cause of those that have been mentioned, then do not remove it for three days or four or five or six; and sometimes this is left as long as twenty days according to how your skill in removing the member has progressed, just as we said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh coagulates over it.
The translation is: And therefore adjust it more tightly than your first adjustment entirely, and adjust according to the thickness of the patient's flesh, as it was preceded by the remembering of them.
And therefore if you have marked the location of the fracture already dry and stretched more than not covered, then you will know that the nourishment is prohibited from reaching it; and therefore embalm it with a beaker of wine twice daily to be entirely visible as you remove it; and let it be for three days; and release the tightness a little, and by this operation supply the limb with nourishment, and cure it gently.
And this is also done by those foolish restorers of the fracture of a limb in another way than it should be restored at first, according to whether it is covered or not, and it is restored according to tortuosity, this is an error according to their operation, and there is great fear, and if it were a worse case, then these ancient things would be enlarged in their freedom and they would become even more wretched with it.
I have not seen any of their deeds on this matter, therefore it is more reasonable that this does not happen.
A description of a fracture in the head occurs.
There are many kinds of fractures, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct. For no fracture is caused by the impact of space, where the percussion hits only within the bone, leaving the bone, just as it is in a fist, therefore this kind is called an "ascial" fracture; or if there is no passage into any part of the bone, and cuts through the flesh but does not pass into the tendon behind; and this type of fracture is called an absolute dislocation.
And the plague of these two fractures is either great or small, and the fracture that is constrictive or expansive; and its cause is percussion with an iron ball or stone on bone, and to their likeness.
This fracture is either penetrating and approaching the pericardium, which leaves the bone; or it's on the surface of the bone, and the plague of these two fractures is either great or small.
This fracture is that it is marred in the bone, at the subtlety of the small hair, and therefore this type of fracture is called "capillary" fracture.
A fracture that is caused by falling or percussion of the bone and to its shape, which enters any layer of the bone into the divided parts, and it occurs in the concave area as with the fall of those who suffer their percussion and the bone breaks from its entry into the divided parts.
It is more often caused in the bodies of human bones, just as it occurs with young children.
So all these types of fractures are stable, just as stones separated. I will recover the memory from all that in its place.
And knows all these types of fractures by detection over them and through inquiry of their internal bones and corrupted flesh that is on them.
There is a special kind of blood that is known for this, which can be discovered on the bone, and it is washed away, and lint put over it, until the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of fractures, it is considered at the beginning the accidents of the illness, and as often as possible to look for the accidents that signify a clear manifestation of fear, just like vomiting of anger, extension, loss of understanding, absence of speech, syncope, fever acute, and swelling of the limbs and rigor of those, and resemblance to them in their major dispositions, it is not considered a cure.
If at times a person's life seems uncertain, then you start the treatment for him.
The cause is that if it has come to you with the plague in the beginning as it was when it occurred and also occurs on days of winter, then cover yourself well, studying in the skin of the bone on the fourteenth day according to all disposition.
But if it is in the days of summer, then cover yourself well by extracting bone under the seventh day, so that the bones are not corrupted by panicle and accidents happen as you have recommended.
But if the fracture has already been corrupted by panicle and the cover is over the brain, and it is broken into small pieces and torn apart, then cover yourself well by inscribing the broken part and tearing it apart, according to what you have recommended.
And this is because you reason the head of the plague-infected person, and uncover about the bone according to custom and manner as your case may be, following the figure of the plague, so that it may be lighter on the plague.
But if you experience difficulty in finding the bone, blood flows, or an apoplexy, then you oppose it, and because this covers, you cover that place with moist rags soaked in wine and rose oil, and cause the plague to rest until the apoplexy is calmed down, and the flow of the wound becomes secure; and thus begin to operate around the bone and in its removal.
It is done according to one of two surgical methods.
And one method is that you cut the bone with an inner saw straight through, and this is how it is done:
Return the administration of more cauterized wounds than what was according to the second.
And consider that you must choose from various scissors, among which you have the thicker ones and the thinner ones; and the thicker ones are more durable than the others, and they have in them a hardness of their extremities, and they are made of iron or steel.
Use them in their facility to percussion on the scissors, so that you do not hit your head and damage it.
And if the bone is hard, durable, consider that you may perforate in the circumference of it before administering the scissors on the superficial layers, which are called shallow cuts.
And do not call it an assis, but rather those that do not pause the end of the bone, near where they are placed, because when a cut is rounded extremity or edge on it, which leaves its head sharp like an edge or a small circle, which forbids being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
It is convenient to take many of these cuts, of which each suits the density of some bone, whether in your hand or in all tests, where the extremity of which is sharp, the length and breadth being according to the density of that test.
This is the translation:
Make a careful incision in the place where the bone is broken and there is subtle pus that you can weigh on top of it in the end, as they have said, until you radiate the bones or with your hand or with another cause for this great disturbance which will appear at that point, just like calenders and forceps subtle.
And be careful that the incisor does not touch any cause of the skull.
And therefore when you have circled the bone and it is perforated, and separated from the skull if continued on it, and you extract that, be careful that you cut out equal and thin as those others in the roughness of it, but nonetheless, with a softer and more subtle pus than the others.
And if there remains any small and delicate part of the bones, then take that as an excuse to deal with the disturbances; place it in its rightful place with linens and apply a poultice for the wound, which they have said.
And the other way of operation is lighter, longer and more cautious than fear, as said Gualia and praised by great praise; and this is his saying: it is necessary for you in the beginning to start uncovering the bone part that has the fracture more violent and more manifest, until when you have uncovered that part and placed on it the extremity of this incisor slowly and gentle, which is this form:
The translation is:
When cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
In cases where there is no hidden cause related to the bone of the gallbladder in certain locations of the bone, the one near the extremity of the joint will be cut, and that which facilitates it, so that it is liberated from its harm and its pain.
If the bone fracture does not penetrate into the gallbladder, and that which is cut or separated from the bone is the surface of it, then because it remains in roughness and subtle fissures, you must cover what causes those roughnesses and eradicate those subtle fissures with sharp razors by which you have prepared the number, of various quantities so that it is possible to administer them in all the most convenient places of their application and the most suitable for each according to where you lose yourself during your operation that fractured bone and its figure.
Covering what you administer in your mixture with which you cut the bone at the beginning will be the last part of those razors, and therefore do not cease doing so until continuity is reached where you go on to administer the powdered plaster and the subtle powder of all that.
There is no cure for small fractures in the fingers or subtle fractures, you will administer treatment according to what you have lost at the right time of recovery.
It is because they are not educated on all the things that have been studied in that art. But concerning this, what has been shown by those who have written about great fractures.
If the pannicol is turned when you radiate the bone, then cover it with oil according to the quantity of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the orifice of the wound; and take another cloth folded or tripled, and submerge it in vinegar and oil, and place it on the first one lightly as you can, so that it does not press too hard on the pus; and administer upon it linen thread, but not tighten it, only to the extent that the wound has, alone.
Let it lie for one or two days until you are sure of the onset of gangrene; then remove it and administer medicines with which it is superfluous dryness, such as linen yarn and flour of ears, powder of stones and of astrology, and substances similar to those.
You make pouder of these medicines that are pulverized on the plague, in such a way as they dry; and universally, administer all this medicine of property which you absterge and do not bite.
Guard well the order of your virtue so that the plague in your cure is clean; and do not be in a state of madness to swallow or ingest anything else; nor let you add more virulence there; for when it is applied to the pannicle of the brain, it corrupts that and poisons that, and happens on the patient with great evil because of that wicked malice.
It happens on the cheek of the head, as it is made manifest by the bone and more when the cure is pressed; and it appears black on its surface; therefore consider how often it happens to the patient the accidents that have been said, wise knowing that it is due to pustules.
If it does not happen blackness but of the medicine that is placed on it, and it is due to that medicine that makes it black, often take from honey one part and from sweet oil three parts, and tie those lines a cloth, and place that over the cheek; and place cure with those special medicines until it is healed.
Book III Chapter 1.
The restoration of the nose when it is perforated.
Be aware that the nose is not split because it is fractured, but rather two separated parts rise up or one of those rarely seen occurrences, for which there are two bones, and when the separation occurs, it leaves cartilaginous tissue instead of bone, and thus does not occur only by fracture, but also by torsion and curvature.
Even if one of the two parts of it is fractured, know that you must insert your little finger into its nose, and then grasp the fracture with your index finger outside, while returning the nose to its natural shape. And do this so that it is done for your ease, and beware that you will not fall ill because of this operation on the patient's malady.
But if the fracture is in the rising part of the nose, and you do not touch that one, know that you must put equal weight on the extremity of the bone where the small swelling is.
If the fracture is in both parts, then you will make it look like that.
If you want to restore the patient's health on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible; otherwise, place him in bed with ice or 20 degrees below freezing to rest from the swelling.
Place a cloth soaked in lard into the nostril of the affected extremity, if the fracture is in one part; or place two cloths, if the fracture is in two parts, so that it covers the thickened lump of such quantity as to cover the nasal passage.
There are some old restorers who say that cloths should be soaked in borage and applied all day, but I have not seen it done to my knowledge; however, some think that the cloth should be soaked in a mixture of honeycomb ash with powdered muller's powder; and let it ease the swelling so that the bone may set and the cartilage becomes hardened.
Some cases are inserted into the nostril instead of the swelling, lest a foul poultice be made, wrapped in lard from a lion; and so that even if the fracture is more violent and the disease cannot be prevented by breathing.
This cause is not necessary for you; and if you wish to do so, do it; and if you wish to do so, do cloths.
If another varicose vein appears in a place where it should not be, apply the nose with cerote or put the wound filled with vinegar and oil, or with diaphragm and olive.
But if you do not occur another varicose vein, then cover that area with flour of sago and powder of honey and almond meal, and place over it a stopper, and do not apply the nose with any cause.
But if the bones of the nose are broken and there is a small fracture or concretion, then cover those areas, extract them with instruments suitable for that, and apply plaster to the wound so that it heals and consolidates, and to the surface as needed.
If a plague has infected the nose, then cover that area with calomel and administer lead pipes into it until all of its salivation.

On the restoration of the jawbone when it is fractured.
When the jawbone is broken and the fracture is outside alone, without being torn into two parts, and curved towards the lower parts, then one's perception is light.
If the fracture is on the right side, then you should insert your left index finger into the mouth of the patient; and similarly if the fracture is in the left mandible, you should put the right index finger into the mouth. And then push that into the gland of the fracture to make it easier for the parts outside to come out, with your other hand from the outside part of the bone; and thus place it evenly on both sides.
If the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two parts, then cover that you will administer an extension of two parts according to right ratio as long as it is possible for the equation of him.
If it happens with movement of teeth to disruption, then cover those which you expect will break at the end of gold or silver or wood; and place a pause over the broken jaw bone, a pause over that doubled cloth, and a pause over that large star-shaped cloth in decent manner made, or a single sheet pulled up to the length of the jawbone; and tie it above such as according to what is fitted on you and which suits the application, until not destroyed.
The patient should command his servant to use rest and quietness, and pause the food of the sick person, avoiding sour foods.
If you think that the figure has been altered in any way, then on the third day you should remove and disinfect it; and straighten it out as it is altered, by applying to it powder of flour, albumen of hen, or wheat flour, so that you will put back its original shape, and place wool upon the applied layer.
And when the attached splint is adjusted over it, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, gently remove that, so as not to let it go until it has healed and strengthened the fracture; for three months have been found to heal this fracture straight.
If another severe edema occurs, then give to him that which has been said many times in the sitting of the patient, until it heals, and remove that swelling.
If the fracture is with a plague, then consider whether it is a separation of the bone or a swelling, and then apply those swelled things to that spot according to what is necessary for its removal from the surrounding inflammation.
If the wound of the plague is straight, then you should enlarge it with the flubotomy according to the quantity of your need.
After you have applied those treatments, and because those ones will not be remade again, if the wound of the plague is enlarged; and if not, pause over one of the emplasters that corresponds to this point and cover it, until it is healed.
It seems like you're saying "The End" or possibly a humorous interjection in Latin.
Of the restoration of the ligature when it is broken.
If the ligature has been broken in a visible spot next to the muscle, and that fracture is done in one of three ways.
Or if it is broken or separated, or separated into two parts other than the ones that do not respond to treatments; and is lighter to restore them; or if it happens again that it responds to treatments, and is difficult to restore them; or if there is a fracture with the plague.
And the operation in that case, when there is a fracture with the plague, is that you make it so that there are two ministers present, so that one holds the assistant and follows the broken ligature, and the other extends the arm over that part.
And then place the fracture in the joint of the thigh, inside where it is being shaped according to its form, so that it is not in prominence or concavity.
If it is necessary to extend the limb, then cover it with a cloth or linen, and let its size be according to your need; and extend and elevate the bowels, while holding down the covering with your hand so that you shape the fracture according to its form.
If you cannot lift the extremity of the bowels outside, so that it is carried to the groin, then cover that the patient lies on their back, and place a cushion on their belly in its middle size.
And the minister presses the muscle on both sides inside so that the bone of the bowels is elevated as much as in the groin area; then you correct the fracture and place it in the joint.
But if you feel stitches of the bowels and they are swollen, then cover that you cut open those and extract them with ease.
If it is retained in the bone, then your ingenuity will not be able to cut into it with one of the saws that you have equipped there, for as you placed those clamps on the furcula (stirrup), the disturbance caused by this serves the ciphac (trephine) device; and this is a form made of wood or iron.
It is similar to the shape of an arrow shaft, and this is the concavity; and its length according to what you needed it for, in proportion to the size of the bone or the smallness of it.
But its length is according to what you can accomplish in the operation; that there be two opposite ends, and one end broad and the other narrow.
If the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you have removed the periosteum of the bone is wide, and it is certain that the apostema (swelling) is secure, then you will close the two lips of the wound with sutures.
If the disruption is small, or you fear an insecure apostema (swelling), then you will apply the wound with cloths and powder according to the quantity of the laceration of the wound.
If an abscess occurs, then immediately put a dressing on it with vinegar and oil, and place it there.
And that the stake over the broken bone should not be sharp; so that you may see the ulcer every day, when the ligament is softened or sometimes the stake has already been removed, then you correct it and strengthen the bandage.
Place the patient's sleeper over their shoulder, and pause those which stir, in order that he may sleep on that pillow; for this way is elevated the assistant of his arm from the lat (of his back), thus elevating the fracture of the furcula to elevation of the muscle; or so it is bound with the arm to the shoulder.
Do not untie the bandage unless it happens in that place or an abscess forms within twelve days.
And appropriate renewal of the plaster if you have seen the face of that person, and adjust in the stricture and restore that and lay it flat until it is restored and the fracture of the furcula is coagulated.
It is strong and comfortable after thirty-eight days, and sometimes it happens in a few weeks or months, that it is made.
Chapter vi.
On the restoration of a fracture of the shoulder.
The spoon is fractured at the joint of the arm and not from the arm itself, only at its edges.
When the location of it is broken - and it is broken in its middle part - and cannot be felt except by touch, therefore follow according to the shape of the fracture's force as you prepare it and reduce it so that it is along the natural form in all manner in which it can be, with your available means.
Place a powder of millstone and alum on the wound, and stop the bleeding; place a pulverized cloth twice, and place a poultice made from a soft tablecloth according to the quantity of the spoon, all or slightly more.
However, if the poultice is concave in some parts of the spoon's location, therefore you will cover that concavity with the same powder, and place the poultice according to equality.
Apply strong plaster under the humectated wound due to constriction, and hold firmness of the poultice until it is not reddened from its own place.
Consider the ligature every day; and whenever it is softened, tie another one, strong as before, and equalize the poultice if it is reddened from its own place.
The patient has laid on his back.
And the spatula (instrument) is restored after XX days or in XXV (days).
Therefore when this number is completed, then you dissolve the ligament, and you must know that it is not suitable for bones of which the beginning is not known or their dissolution.
And if you proceed to the place of the bone pit and put aside the chain, then you slice it over there, and hold it, and do so as they have said in the fracture of the Furcula of Sado-Caecilia, Caut if it occurs here.
Chapter VII.
On the restoration of the foot fracture.
The foot sometimes is broken in the middle of it and then it becomes swollen; but the extremities of it are torn apart and crushed.
And of the accidents when it is broken in the middle that it inclines towards the parts and occurs great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, fever, and severe sweating; and it is declared in its cavity in the broken bone and is not concealed to the sensation.
Joint pain caused by cold humors infiltrating each part of the body is customarily called gout by doctors.
Stop over the plaster and dressing to allow it to dry and set on a soft surface such as cloth or calico, similar in texture to leather, wrapped in a cloth; then gently place that over the broken bone so as not to dislodge it. Go around the bandage according to retortency towards the back occasionally, and strengthen it with strict tension; consider the bandage at all times, and when softened, strengthen it further.
If it is necessary to provoke the removal of that [bandage], due to corrosion or swelling, or pain, or an ulcer that occurs at that place, then you cut it open and drain it, and remove the dressing and correct what happens because of this in a manner of treatment for him; and return the plaster, if necessary, to its face; and adjust his strictures until he is healed.
Opening of the eighth chapter or section of a medical book about gouty arthritis in feet.
On the restoration of backs when they are bent, or curved.
Be aware that a fracture of the back is not in the bone itself, but rather in the larger areas where it meets the two; and from their extremities, to the head, there does not occur any irritation or constriction other than that which comes from the cartilages. And this is well known, it is not hidden from the senses, for the inquiry of the body reveals these things.
And the restoration is thus that it equals the fracture of these things, according to the possible method, while it is encased according to what is convenient; and it wraps it up with plaster and strengthens the broken bone at the spot if necessary.
And if the back fracture inclines towards the joints, then it occurs severe illness and sharp pain, just as with those who have pleurisy; therefore, when one puts on the splint, it occurs difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of phlegm; and this is hard to cure.
They are already in a state of advanced decay in that place of suffering.
And it is said that one should apply to the patient's stomach what food can cause inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly may be inflated and stretched, and the fracture pushed outward from the affected parts.
May we be cautious about this so that it does not lead to the formation of an abscess, unless it happens; and if it happens, then relief will be provided for it.
They said that it should be stopped by the wind and that something be applied to increase its strength; this is like reasoning, but however it is feared that the wind will drive the excesses to that place because of weakness.
They said that the place should be covered with wool that is already submerged in cauterization oil, and small powder should be applied between the ribs while it is being filled, so that the ligature wraps around it when you wrap it on retentiveness; and apply treatment to the patient with pleurisy of food and medicine.
If the disease violently constrains the patient, which does not suffer, and the bone pokes through the veil with a puncture wound, fear is aroused over the patient, as long as it is believed that to break open on the spot, uncover the broken coast, and place on top of that instrument that conserves the ciphac, the remembrance of which was preceded, and penetrate the bones with ease, and extract it.
And that we adjust the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with cauterization, and treat it with plaster in between until it is healed.
And if it happens that an apostema occurs, then your hand and fill with powder in oil roseate, and place over the spot, so that the disease is cured by that which covers the reduced apostema.
And let him lie on his back over the side upon which he sleeps, until he is healed.
It seems like you're ending the text. Is that correct? If so, I can stop translating and we can consider this a complete translation of the medieval medical treatise.
On the restoration of fracture of the spine of the two and the neck.
Some visible fractures in the neck bones and cracks at their joints, and similar fractures in the spine of the back. When this occurs to one and you want to know if they will recover or not, then consider, because for a certain number of times your hands have become softened, deadened and frozen, and cannot feel those things anymore nor can be moved or strengthened those, when you press on those with your fingers or poke them with an needle, and you do not feel pain in that area, it is known that it is not healing, and in those same months of disposition it is mortal.
But if you press on those areas and feel a constriction with the fingers and puncture, then it is known that the neck of the bone is saved and the disease will be cured by treatment.
If you see the spine of the neck similar to this and want to know if it will heal or not, then consider the feet of him.
If you feel that for a certain time they are just softened, accidents happen to those areas that occur in the abdomen, and when you put weight on his back, he experiences windiness and difficulty urinating as he wants to, and sometimes is repelled onto his back and cannot, then it is known that it is mortal, and therefore do not work on his healing.
It seems to say: If it does not occur due to those reasons, the cause is better and less serious.
The cure is that you perform the operation of tying off the apothema with a cautery oil rubbed on the fractured vertebrae, or applying some mulberries as a poultice; pause over that place occasionally during the day until it makes the apothema sleepy.
And then pause an emplastrure comfortable and existing, and strengthen over that one limb; command the patient to rest and be quiet, and do not sleep on the joint where it hurts until he is healed.
But if it happens that the bone is broken or some other cause that has separated from him, then frequently apply pressure to the cord and pull out that bone; and then adjust the two lips of the wound, with suture if necessary; and cure that one as soon as possible with an ointment on the infected part until he is healed.
But if the lower part of the bone is broken and it's the end of the limb, then frequently cover that you enter the tendon of the foot with your right hand in the armpit, and equalize the broken bone with the other hand as possible by second-degree calculation; and then apply pressure on the emplastre and astelha, if necessary, and strengthen it.
If you feel broken or shattered things in that place, then put your finger on it and hold onto it, and cure the wound with the healing process that occurs before it is healed.
And so be it.
Of the restoration of the width.
The bones of the wide joints are broken, and if they break, then the fracture is merely a communication in the extremities of those places and are stuck in the length and decline to the parts of the separation; and it happens to the malady pain in that place and puncture, and the cushion is stunned when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you stretch your hand over that until it is on the fracture, which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only in one extremity of it alone, then you cover that so according to what clothes it has on in proportion to your equation, until it is assembled to its natural figure.
But if the fracture is in the long or where it declines to the parts of those others, then you lay the malady on your belly until it is prepared for you the restoration of that fracture. And then when you have swallowed that, pause on the plaster, and place your hand over that wooden beam or cord, and stretch strongly for support of the structure which you do not fear puncture of fracture nor removal of the star.
And then you will fill in the cavity with that, so that it fills the space inside which that toe supports the structure according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on his two sides or over his chest.
But if an apothem is cauterized, then you will stop the extension of it and its restoration until the apothem is sedated, and place your hand over there so that it sits according to what was previously said; and then return to the restoration of it, and strongly cover that area with a cloth.
And if they are broken or shattered in the saturated bone, then you will treat them.
It seems like you're ending a section or a chapter with that "Capitol.xi." notation, which is often used to indicate the end of a chapter in medieval texts.
On the restoration of the fracture of the assistant.
The adjutor is what is located between the arm and the head of the shoulder.
If it is broken, then the restoration of him is in one of two manners, whereof is one that you take a piece of flesh from the middle of goutiness according to this form:
They are tied in two extremities with ligaments, and it is suspended from the elevated place.
It follows the sickness on a stool, and it is placed with its broken arm outside the flesh piece until it reaches the tip of the finger in the middle location from which the curvature of the finger is attached.
And it is placed on that very heavy cause, or the minister extends it to those parts behind; and the doctor places his hands over the fractured area as many times as necessary, until the fracture returns according to its nature.
And the other manner is that the sickness is laid on its own neck and hand, suspends his arm with ligaments; and he commands two ministers to have it so that one of them holds it above the fracture with his hands; and another holds him lower down; and whichever of them extends to its part.
If you want the extension to be stronger, then you must bind tightly over the fracture with one bandage and over that with another bandage, and whichever of the two servants extends it to both their parts.
Therefore if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then cover half of the bandage on the navel and the other leaves the fracture covered with leather.
Similarly if the fracture is close to the bone, then cover the bandage over that place and over that bone.
Apply that easily and with its work, and place as much pressure on it as is needed, so that if there is an apoplexy, the cautery may occur.
But if an apoplexy occurs, then loosen the bandage within seven days, and place a cloth soaked in vinegar and oil rose on it to check for the rupture of the apoplexy, and bind again.
The way to bind that is: place plaster over the fracture, and cover with a bandage made of wool on the plaster; and adjust the arm above that assistant, and place your hand open on your muscle.
The text means: Place a cloth and strength on the assistant's arm so that the arm is in place of stars, if this does not prevent any cause of the broken bone.
The text means: And later use stars.
The text means: And then places a star on the fracture of that star which was more swollen and stronger than the other stars; and pauses between each star the latitude of the said, and is the length of the stars according to the fracture adding three words from the whole division.
The text means: And place strength over the stars according to the structure which I have said at the beginning of the chapter.
The text means: And so that your structure over the location of the fracture be more straight. The text means: And the more swollen the fracture is, the smaller the structural framework should be.
The text means: And therefore when the situation of the stars and the framework is as we have said in the time you restore the limb to its condition, then so do it.
The text means: And if you fear gangrene, then soften the framework and the stars into the seventh day as we have said.
Consider the inflammation in all parts for three days so that it does not occur at the most sensitive or inflamed place; or if food is prohibited from reaching the member according to the superfluous constraint of a strict treatment; and therefore correct everything according to what we have said.
However, if you are uncertain about it not occurring, then do not remove the dressing but keep it for three days or more.
It is recommended that the patient sleeps on their back and their hands are placed over the stomach.
Pause on the assistant cooked with wool gauze and consider in all hours of the night or day that there is no swelling nor dissolution of the broken member's figure, or that the inflammation is softened, therefore correct it according to your skill.
Pause the patient's food according to what we have determined previously, so that the food is subtle at the beginning until it is eaten more strongly, and also be cautious not to overfeed him.
As is the custom, the assistant and the pillow are strengthened in 40 days; and be cautious that they be released and administered with hot water and be medicated with what corrects them.
If the fracture is laid up in traction, then do not disband that bandage and the stitches are put in during the days or within two months.
Chapter 12.
On the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called "forks"; one small, and that is the one where the thumb is joined, and the other large, and it is placed beyond the small one from above.
And if the larger fork is easily broken, or the smaller one, and both are easily broken in pieces.
And when the small fork is broken below, then the restoration of it is light, and the healing of it is even lighter.
And when the fork is broken at a lower fracture, then it is bad, and the healing of it is difficult.
And even worse than that is when both bones are broken in pieces.
So, if the bone that is broken is the small fork below, then it is convenient for the doctor to restore it, while doing a short extension and facilitating its healing.
The text means: But if the wound is large it is done so that it may be closed.
If the two wounds are sewn shut, then you must pause the stitches more tightly.
You must cover the form of the hand with its restoration and extend it on a cushion, so that the palms of the hand are towards the joints, more than all other words, and the ear is lower than the others, and the patient lies on a heated bed.
There is a cushion under him in the height or lower part of him, so that the patient does not further work.
And the minister extends the arm of the joint as far as he can above it or below it, so that some may put their hand on the shoulder and another in the same way.
And the doctor binds the bone inside which was reduced according to the better figure it could.
If the fracture of the bone is sagacious, then you must reduce the entire piece in its place at your virtue.
If in the sick person you find a separate seat or it does not lie on your expectation for recovery, then fix yourself firmly over it and secure that according to the manner in which we have said.
But if the fracture is a plague, you have already made the capital operation for that, and therefore take care of it.
If it happens that there is an edema of the caut at the beginning of your treatment, then take linen wrapped with rose oil and white wax, and place it between subtlety and fineness, and a strong linen over that, with subtle structure until the edema subsides; and afterwards remove the cerot and apply an emplastre prepared with powder of milled stone and clear honey, and place stars; and let be the star which is placed on that fracture more soft and stronger.
And know that the number of stars on the arm is visible in major dispositions, or namely a fracture in one spine or two joined spines.
And place the support on the spot of the fracture more strong and vehement, and when it is possible to tighten the structure to the other parts of the fracture or to the lower parts of him, place the support a little moist according as you follow the recall of him in the beginning of the operation.
The text means: And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture are soft, humid cloths, and not hard or harsh, and the cloth which holds it in place is strong, so that it is neither too subtle nor too coarse, as they have said.
The text means: And he considers the limb and the complaint after three days. The text means: And if some cause occurs which requires correction, as it happened to the limb, and often the person covers the limb with hot water until that spasm ceases.
The text means: And if the limb does not return to its normal state before rest is taken, and you reapply the structure.
The text means: And if the structure is already softened and the bone has been mended and resembles those, then correct everything with your own skill.
The text means: And he considers further that if nourishment is prohibited from reaching the limb due to excessive structure, for fear of softening it too much, then cover that lightly and let him wait for a while before nourishing it again, and strengthen that.
If it is not true that the malady has any of those things which we have said, then do not suppose that there is an opening within twenty days or sooner than one of those.
And accordingly suspend the hand of the patient due to its tendency towards agitated movements, and let it sleep on its two feet.
You know that this fracture is restored in xxx days or in xxxii days, or light ones are restored in xxviii days, and all of this is according to the disposition of the complexities and the dispositions of its nature.
Chapter XIII.
On the restoration of fractures of the little finger and the thumb.
You know that to the little finger and the nail of the thumb, fractures occur only in thin and weak parts.
And when there is a fracture or an abrasion of the hand, it is understood that the malady follows catarrh and appears in its centers, and accordingly place your hand over those extended.
The doctor extends the broken bones and puts the surgeon's hand inside so that they can be properly aligned.
And afterwards cover with plaster and bandage, unless an apoplexy occurs, in which case apply a poultice; and place the stone above according to the size of the location, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the wound is on the divided parts of the abdomen near the palm of the hand, and afterwards make a resemblance to a cloth bandage, and command the patient to hold it tight with their palm tied; wrap it tightly in a long cloth.
And place the stone of copper on cloth so that it may be lifted, in order to apply the body to the palm; tighten it as needed.
But if the fracture is on the outer parts, afterwards cover that part and another stela of the limb placed in the palm, so that the hand may be open and straight; and place the bandage as it has been rolled up along the fingers tied with ligaments.
If it happens that a fracture occurs in one of the small joints of the fingers, then if it is the little finger, let him be placed according to the cubit and hold him tight with the palm and if you want, pause his hand on this small joint for so that the fracture is elevated and not made worse.
But if the fracture is in any of the other fingers, as in the middle finger, or index, or ear, or little finger, then let him be placed and held by the same joint which was injured; or all joints fastened together according to continuity, and it is better; or pause on that small joint, just as we have said for the foot.
Consider it in your restoration, and place that accordingly, the position of apotema caut and opposed - against his operation - because when any such case occurs, according to how many times the story is repeated.
Chapter XIV.
On the Restoration of Fracture of Bone in the Hip.
The bone of the hip is often found fractured and declared by sense, according to which it has been converted to the departure before and to the supreme pus.
The treatment begins by strengthening one patient's limb on the fracture and releasing the other limb, and the patient is placed on their belly and face.
Appropriate the minister extends the entire limb in its direction according to the quality, when the fracture is at the middle location of the bone.
However, if it is bound to the quality of the wound, then the limb is pulled towards the direction of pain at the point of the needle, so that the extension may be done on him, and the other limb releases the fracture.
Similarly, if the fracture is bound to the pain, then the limb is pulled towards the pain, and the extension is done at the parts away from it.
Then the doctor applies glue to the bone on both sides, inside where reduction is made according to the natural shape and the bone is conjoined with good conjunction; then cover that with plaster and stricture, if it does not occur to the member being amputated. However, if it occurs in the amputated member, then you lessen that for a few days until the wound cauterizes, and appropriate returns to care.
The joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Put a long strip between the swellings and the part of the body just below it on both sides, and remove the highest portion of the strip from the two parts, and wrap around the swelled area what is in excess of the bandage.
Place your hand over the swellings at that fracture point and place another stick over the bone of the other side.
Stuff the empty spaces between the bone and the swellings with thick cloths, to cause the constriction to be coagulated.
Apply a strong dressing over the middle of the location of the fracture with three or four folds, and as you move away from the site of the fracture, your dressing becomes smaller and lighter and more moist.
Stretch out both extremities of the strip to the parts below until it reaches the hollow of the foot, and strengthen both extremities of the sticks from the other side so that the bandage is not removed from its place.
If you carefully examine the structure on that person, so that it does not cause any damage or rotting of the body part, nor any swelling or inflammation similar to those; and if some cause of those things occurs, then stop your treatment from them, and correct what happens entirely, according to what has been said before.
But if the pain is in the bone, which you have put there, then cover it as you think is possible; and if not, make over it, and cure that from which comes the previous memory before you recover the health.
And some times are strengthened this fracture of the bone elsewhere than they are adjusted to that star, as it has been said in the assistant and in the arm.
But however in the restoration of it in that manner, it does not happen to the patient's claudication; and if it is restored alone, instead of applying another cushion, because otherwise the other one that is applied to him will be necessary that he walks poorly from which he has always been.
And it is known that the bone is strengthened in 40 days or a little more or a little less, and all this is according to the diversity of the complexities and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Restoration of the fracture of the knee of the patient.
Know that fractures of the knee joint of the patient are more common and occur more frequently due to trauma.
But if the fracture does not occur, it is often only a fissure or a tear in its parts, and this is considered a wound or several wounds, and on top of all that, the patient has a bad condition.
And the restoration of him is only achieved by encasing that which is broken into its parts, and combining them together as much as possible according to what is possible by equation, facility, and craftsmanship.
And place plaster and cover that square plate, if needed, and tie those with a strong bond according to what is convenient.
And consider all the dispositions that were recommended for other fractures, in this case as well, with cauterization and similar procedures to those for others that oppose all accidents at that point, so it may be healed.
Chapter XVI.
Restoration of fracture of the groin.
Understand that in the groin there are two bones, one large and named for the name of the groin, and the other small and named for the pinion.
And it happens to some of the species of fracture this occurs on both bones of the arm, and therefore is done the restoration of that as well as the restoration of the bent arm, and the operation of it is one.
And if you cut two bones together, the groin is converted into all parts.
And if you cut the small bone, the groin is converted into the parts of the thigh.
And if you cut the large bone, it's hindered, and that is one of those causes that are not agreeable.
And you will provide extension, equitation, and ligature of the joints according to the bent arm.
But however, if the fracture of the groin is sharp and without smooth edges, that extension be less and lighter, and alleviate your virtue.
Joint pain caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, is customarily called gout by doctors.
Place a bandage over each wound in two layers according to its length, and put one over the opening of the one side and the other over the other side, so that they are closed into a single hole in the foot's bottom.
Bring the two stitches to three places on each extremity and in the middle, where this structure is forbidden to curve at the right and left openings, and it will be done well.
There is already a bandage made of leather according to the length of the wound, and it is placed there to prevent that part from moving.
It is more effective to do this when there is a fracture, and when it becomes infected properly.
Take into account the wound every day and study it further at that time, and you should guard it from inflammation and infection or other similar causes; and when any such cause occurs, oppose it with what is effective so that it does not hinder the healing.
It seems like we've reached a section break in the text. Would you like to continue translating the next part?
A fracture of the ankle bone and the bones of the foot and toes.
At the ankle bone, it does not occur a fracture of all; but the bones of the foot sometimes occur fractures, and the toes of the foot hardly ever occur fractures, and they do not occur in them, but only in certain seasons.
If the bones of the foot end with a fracture and sometimes those bones are elevated above themselves between them, then the sickness will pause its foot on the ground prepared in this way as a support.
And place one foot on this that is elevated by those bones, and press it, and hold, and press into the affected area until you turn back to the locations.
And place plaster and bandage on top of those, and put a small board under the belly of the foot to which are two flat plates.
And tighten that band around the foot, and stretch downward, as you have enveloped it in cloths and other causes of which you prescribed.
And after three days or four, you will loosen the bandage, as you have found the bones pressed together, or broken, or dislocated, and the operation for those is done with caution.
The text means: "But if you have applied the treatment, then restore them, and equalize those also with the youth and repair as well to your own body. The text means: "And hold the punctured stick straight according to its length and make it less painful for him a little; and place the patient on this table which you recommended, and bind that limb with strength.
The text means: "But if the puncture of the bones is two or three or more, then hold fast on any one of these stars according to its quantity wrapped in linen cloth and bind the table at the lowest point of the foot, so that he may stand on one of the legs of the table, facing onto his belly, so that you have good retention.
The text means: "And it is convenient to you that you do not forget, nor consider all the causes which I have told you in other fractures of the accidents that have happened; and be opposed to every accident with what you know.
The text means: "Chapter XVIII.
The text means: "Of the fracture of the neck of the woman, and of the bone of the penis in a man, and of the thigh's groin.
When the woman's toe is cut, then immediately stop that cutting, and bend that back towards the little joint, and hold it behind.
And then wrap the mother's dressing around the toe, as with a spore; and also that the woman may be scratched, and raise her little joint by little, until all that is outside comes forward before the toe, like a spore, and the bone returns.
And then powder on the back of him, and when he needs to urinate, draw back the toe with ease, and pour urine, and return it again according to the manner in which that substance mixes at the beginning, and also return to his first powder.
And cover it as for seven days or a little more, until that is restored.
And if you wish, take an ewery of wool and stretch over the foot's track a tube made of flax; and insert all the bladder into the toe, and then breathe into the tube with virtue until the bladder is inflated within the toe, that the fracture may return.
It should be filled with poultices and left for as many days as has been recorded, until it is healed.
When the bone of the foot of man or woman is fractured, it is customarily administered in restoration and puncture of it as recorded in the ankle.
And that which is of great importance is not concealed in these fractures proper and proper, and only occurs occasionally, mainly in one who has some study and knowledge and understands this book; because that fracture signifies to you in the major dispositions via ductus mediterraneum in the restoration and stricturing of it, therefore know well.
But in the foot of man when it is fractured, he takes garum of animal, and puts the foot into that; and places his hand over the wrapping of cloth, and wraps it up, and lays it aside for three days or more until it is healed.
Chapter XIX.
On the restoration of fracture of bones when it is swollen.
It is suitable for that person to whom the fracture occurs, and especially if the bone is large like the os coccygis or adjutivi, or similar in shape as such, you should cut and flay that immediately, if the conditions of flaying by the artery indicate so, as they have said.
If the wound is draining pus, then cover that you collect it in the retention of it so that you powderize over it three times, if your other cause is not present.
And from that day on, start restoring the fracture in that same manner, and do not prolong it unless an apoplexy occurs.
But if an apoplexy occurs, then lay aside the restoration of it within three days, until the apoplexy has subsided, and do not approach it on the fourth day and the rest, for you will cause more accidents.
But if the bone is broken over the neck uncovered, then cover that you perform to reduce it and immerse it in your hands with facility and with little extension.
But if the extension is not according to your preparation and the proportion of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands as much as possible this support; and it is this support which is made of iron, the length of which is 7 or 8 digits, and the width according to the quantity of the wound; and for that reason it is necessary for the doctor to take from those three or four according to the quantity you indicated at this time in all kind of fractures.
It should be "And it is round, and in a little roughness, so that it may not be folded by the comprehension of those present in the hour of the operation.
It should be "And it is sharp at the extremity to which there is an edge on its own extremities; and the underside of it is swollen in thickness, and from the middle into the parts.
It should be "And this is the form of it:
It should be "Which is named in Greek 'Labrous venter Ateleiram', thus it is a little.
It should be "Why must the extremity of it be raised high above the joint of the bone.
It should be "And it is inserted into a place where it returns to the bone, and it is surrounded by no equation.
It should be "And therefore it is forced to enclose the extremities of the fracture between them; and if the broken extremity is subtle, and does not take that which stimulates it for good exception, it is customary to insert the extremity of that bone into where the instrument has power over it.
If you cannot reduce the bones of this entire region where there is an incision, then enclose it in such a way as one should with the incisors that have been said to be; or sew it up with one of the sewing needles in any manner that seems possible.
And place what remains inside the bone of roughness and small scratches.
And when the bone is reduced, and you place the reduction on the patient's chest, where the pain feels sharp and violent, since you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; then do so with great care.
When the completion of your restoration is done to the bone, and you submerge it in a vinegar solution, black and specifically if it's summer, and do not apply heat over the painful spot or any other cause where there is oil, so that it does not cause swelling and corruption.
And provide stitches in the hour of your completion of the bone's restoration, and soften the discovered wound so that it can be sutured with strings and wraps according to the quantity of the wound.
Be careful not to strain the wound with the fracture, because many foolish doctors have done this before, and it has led to death or a deadly illness for their patients, so it is healing. If the tie (or bandage) is too loose, soft, and different from the tightness of other fractures.
If the wound is large or a severe one, and you fear accidents such as bursting of blood vessels (or "alcus accidentz mals"), which have been noted by others, and there's great pain in that place, then do not stand on those stakes, but rather lay down over them with hard cloths instead of stakes and strain the wound with those.
When the wound has started to swell and pus is formed in it, even if you've placed a cloth over it before, you should remove that cloth and apply heat with caldron (or hot water) to it, as is our custom when treating wounds, such as applying tetrafarmacos (antibiotics or medicine) similar to the one for tetanus.
It is advisable to cut the ligament and consider the wound as potentially fatal by day and night until it's consolidated and closed, and it's safe for the member to be prepared in such a way that the pus can drain out from it into its parts with ease.
If the plague passes for many days and is not consolidated or separated from its arm, you know that it is a small pustule from which you should investigate the wound. And of those pustules, some are separated and drained out, while others are not separated from one another and put the member back on and make it cause pain; therefore, consider them according to what is possible for you.
If it happens to the plague that it is swollen or ulcerated, this is inflammation, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction; therefore, cover what seems suitable for you on the side of the wound from which the story of its treatment precedes.
And from that in which you should put the poultice: when the swelling is large, protrude over the limb like the bones of the wound and the assistant, and make them resemble those of the great members, but do not presume to touch or extract it for fear of it, even though death has occurred many times by this method; take away the pus as soon as possible, lest it weighs you down for twenty days or thirty; and therefore treat the plague if it is seen by you, and if not, apply poultice.
Book 20.
On the healing of a knot that occurs in the tissue from any fracture.
Sore marks occur from this knot in the tissue of a fracture healing, and more so when it is near the joints, and distorts the shape of the limb; and weakens the limb to its natural operation.
Therefore, if the knot is recent, it applies to that medicine which has already applied for this ailment, or else, and examines, and scratches, and pierces, and presses, and makes a resemblance to those; therefore, take from that some of them or all, and apply them to that knot in a poultice, and bind it tightly upon it with good constraint.
And let loose the tightness that does not loosen it for many days; and take away that one and apply another, until the knot is healed; or bind strongly on that linen of lead, since lead has property to cure all that is inflated in the limbs.
Mortality has not yet set in on the converted body and straightened limbs are necessary to provoke a more intense suffering, and therefore cut that part at its highest point, and insert something into it to absorb its severity, or place that within the acorn that needs to be squeezed until it is softened; cure that within so as to heal.
Chapter XXI.
When the fracture is restored and it's left to remain in that manner, the subtle member and the delicate flesh will not follow its natural state.
When the fracture of the bone is restored, and it's left to remain in that manner, nonetheless, there are certain causes: where one is excessive solution of the ligament and its binding is not according to what is required; or due to superfluous tension of the ligaments within which the nutrition cannot run freely to the member; or because of excessive bleeding; or due to excessive movement in an unsuitable time; or because of a small amount of sanative matter in the patient's body and due to its weakness.
Curing for this is to give the patient food and water, so that his heart becomes soft within him, and his medicine is multiplied in him; and he should be given bread; and gall and lettuce are to be administered to him.
Pause the swelling on the limb, so that the swelling may take on its normal form, or continue to apply ice water treatment until the nourishment returns and it returns to its natural figure.
The chapter number is not directly translatable, but based on the style of the text, it appears to be a chapter title or section heading, possibly indicating the order in which procedures are performed.
Concerning the cure of twisted bones, when they are restored to their natural form and it is forbidden to perform surgery on them from now on.
When an accident occurs on a member that has been restored to its natural form, and swelling and prominence of the twisted bone and node occur, and as a result it is no longer possible for the member to maintain its shape, but nevertheless the member is not prohibited from its natural operation, at this time it must be understood that those who claim to restore such a member are indeed doing so with new knots.
But now it is well known to foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land, and this operation is most reprehensible, bringing great fear for the sign from which death results.
But if claudication and nodulation are recent, it is allowed to apply ice water treatment in which the cooling plants mollify, just as they do for feet of high altitude and rough skin, and meat, and similar appearance to those; and it should be done on a poultice with a softening poultice like dollalon well made; or if the price of mucilage of high altitude is sought, and crushed on gray of gall or on olive oil of chamomile, and applied on that; or what are the fatty figs crushed and spread on the skin of the sow, and resembling those of the medicines named in the writings as consolidation.
Some wounds dissolve after repeated friction due to being on the most humid parts, and are administered movement of the limb throughout all hours.
But sometimes tortuosity has returned and is done forcibly, and since it was converted into a wound and provoked necessity for cure with iron, often that the most stubborn cuts are stopped and the continued dissolution of the bone is dissolved, and so that what exceeds the nodes of those physicians who cut through bones with subtle incisions, be administered ease in that one solicited and studied.
Chapter 23.
On the displacement of a joint.
Displacement is a sudden occurrence at any of the joints of the body, for which it is prohibited to move, and the figure of the limb is reduced, bringing on the patient great pain and serious injuries.
Therefore when a dislocation occurs, one must immediately attempt to reduce it, and not delay in doing so, because if it is delayed, the joint becomes inflamed and very painful with that, making it difficult to perform the reduction of a dislocation.
And so it is not to be expected that you should be proud or upright in the hour of separation, for many times we have seen spasm and pain arrive unexpectedly.
But when this happens, it is to be hoped that you will retreat into the depths of the ulcer, and let the separation take place while you pause; and let the member be loosened in water cold and oil, and return it to ease.
And the entire member is cured with what returns in its place, and memory comes back to that spot.
And I already have ordered the capitals of dislocation according to what is preceded in fracture; from the top of the body, the superior part comes above until the left side.
Caput XXIV.
On the cure of dislocation of the jaw, left.
When both jaws are dislocated if not torn; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two manners: either they are remade from their joints with little movement, or they are completely dislocated and completed, until they are softened at the beginning of the joint while saliva flows from the ulcer and it cannot hold that nor can close its mouth, and its tongue is wrapped in its word.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
But if the dislocation is total and complete, then it should be covered with a light reduction, and not delayed for too long.
And that's the minister should have the patient, and then let the doctor put one finger of his one hand into the space between the dislocated jawbone and teeth, from below up to the dislocation of the jawbone inside the mouth, if it's on one side; or insert both fingers evenly, if it's on two sides, and take care of other parts of his hands that are outside which will grab; and he commands the patient to stop his jaws and release them so they don't come out from any part; and the doctor grabs the jawbone and puts it back inside until he returns to his place.
And if it's hard to reduce the dislocation, and especially if both jaws are severely dislocated, then he should administer a mixture of water and cold oil inside while he does the light reduction of both at once and doesn't delay the reduction of both completely, as they have said.
And so when you return and are lowered in, and the mouth of the patient is closed and not softened, then place yourself on those powdery drapams with cerot, and let it be made from wax and oiled rose; and tie it with ease and thin ropes.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and the head is placed between two aurelles, so that they will not complain at the first attempt or to the left; and do not force them to chew any food; until when their body is freed from the lion's strength, in order that when the pains are alleviated and the mandibles are numb, then let them speak as much as they can.
And thus provide with ease, and do not labor over the attention to the mouth, concerning eating and drinking and urination, until when the mandible is numb and healed.
But if it is hard to reduce two dislocated mandibles when they are displaced in one hour and not returned to their proper place, then numerous previous accidents have occurred, such as fevers and frequent vomiting, and the stomach is swollen with great pain, and there comes a pure but violent colic.
When you have done that, you will know it is a loss; and often what has been lost can be seen after four days.
Chapter xxv.
On the reduction of the displacement of the wrist joint and of the extremity of the muscle.
The wrist joint is not displaced from the body's bone due to its continuity on the foot; and sometimes it is displaced outward at the beginning, and this is declared in writing.
And its restoration is that the malady is laid on his back and his arms are extended. And place a constraint on the location with your palm, using a firm bandage so that it will return.
And place pressure on that plaster and powder, and strengthen it.
But the extremity of that person who has seized the vein and continues it, is not displaced on any day; rather, if it is reduced and enclosed as they have said, and according to what you have provided.
Place your hand on that plaster, powder it, and tighten the dressings, and command the sick person to remain quiet and rest until they are healed.
This is the method of curing that reduces the extremity of the muscle when it is separated from its place.
Section xxvi.
On the reduction of muscle dislocation.
You should know that the muscle is not dislocated but rather in three ways: one of which is dislocated from the start of the tendon to the point where it starts.
And the second is that it is dislocated from the start of one side of the muscle, and this is done so that it is not dislocated from the other side by the shoulder joint; nor is it dislocated towards the front by the nerves.
And it is more severely dislocated and protrudes outward from the areas beyond the start of the tendon; and more so in those where the flesh is scanty, it is less dislocated; but in those with more fatty tissue, it projects outward with difficulty.
When a strong blow occurs on an acute home, percussion or crushing, and the muscle is swollen with an abscess, it becomes caught by this that already is dislocated.
Therefore you should push this into while standing on solid ground, and then process the healing of it.
And it is known that dislocation occurs when the joints are left undisturbed; so that you may distinguish between the muscle displaced and the healthy muscle, for you will feel between them various differences manifest, and you will feel in the head of the muscle a concavity where the swelling meets the pressure from the surface in such a way as to produce a lump, and at the patient's feet cannot reduce the hand to its original position, nor be able to move it completely.
If it is a dislocation, then you will feel the foot or leg swollen, and you will therefore carefully examine the manifestation of the touch, and do not conceal it.
And of this dislocation, a gentle reduction is made when the joint is fresh and the patient is in childhood.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises his hand to the joints in question; and then places his sleeves aside from the swelling, and elevates the joint with great force to its proper place, and the minister raises his hand, and extends it in such a way that it returns gently.
Joint pain caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body and lead to dislocation, which occurs several days after the initial injury, is treated by bathing in cool water and administering an ointment made from rue, fenugreek, and meletilla, similar to the treatment for a high fever.
The ulcer should be raised on the patient's back and placed in a harness that prevents movement between lift and strictura, and the doctor places his foot on the spine, elevates the head of the muscle with a vice, ties the leg of the patient so that it does not move excessively, and another servant holds the patient's head so that it does not move excessively, for fear that it will return to its original place.
If you wish, reduce the ulcer in this manner: for it is that you present a man who is longer than the ulcer, and located on the opposite side, and insert his muscle into the space of the ulcer and elevate the tissue around the ulcer until the ulcer is suspended in air, and another servant pulls back the leg of the patient away from its abdomen. If the malady is mild, then cover it with another cause to suspend it, so that it does not worsen, for soon the displacement will return.
And it is reduced in this manner: so that it is laid on the ground a long stick with a rounded head, like a ball of mortar, not thick or thin, and you place over its head drapes linen, and the malady is standing according to the length of the stick, and extend the hand of him towards other parts; and extend the body of him of the other part with firmness, so that the joint returns to its place at great speed.
And if it is difficult to reduce him for all the causes that we have mentioned, then you use this cure: so that you take a stick of the length equal to the span of two arms, and its width be four fingers, and its thickness removed from the shoulder according to this shape:
And you place over the rounded head linen straps to prevent the stick from drawing out the malady.
The translation is: And place them on the tip of the patient's body, and extend your hand or arm over the wound into the parts you have exposed, and tie the flesh around the assistant and arm and the extremity of your hand.
The translation is: Place your arm over a scale of stairs according to the size, and stretch out your hand into the parts you have exposed, and let the other thing hang from the other side, as it is in the joint.
The translation is: And when the instrument has completed it according to any manner possible, and afterwards cover with a woolen gauze of size; and then pause in plaster prepared from powder of mill am enses [meaning ground mallow] and album of hou [possibly allum or alum, a type of salt] on all the muscle, as if it is turned down, and place stitches on the wound again with strictura [a surgical suture]; and the ligament be rolled over the plaster, and his hand attached to the neck of him, and let be so that his hand is not bound for seven days.
The translation is: And cover the food of the sick person little, until the member is comfortable, as it is lighter to healing of him.
The text means: And therefore place meat near it (or on) in order to be eaten after seven or eight days; and so if it is not softened, then it is already healed.
The text means: But if the joint is dislocated because of frequent humidity or due to another cause, then cover it with cautery on three tracts, as said in the chapter on cautery.
The text means: And if all that is done and after seven days the ligament is loosened and the joint is not closed, then reduce the plaster and binding on it some times, but it will not be firm and the arm cannot be lifted to the affected parts, for sure the nerves of him, which are at the top of the muscle, either cut or extended or softened, know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The text means: From the dislocation of that area, it is necessary to treat the foot and breast or the parts behind, reduction is done with impulse and extension with hands until it returns.
The text means: And the other binding should be administered in that area, and care should be taken to heal it until it is healed.
If the treatment fails and gravity sets in on the member, and tardiness in movement of it, then the illness uses of baths moistures visible between that gravity is alleviated and it returns to its original nature.
Chapter xxvii.
On the cure of dislocation of the wrist.
Know well that the joint of the wrist is dislocated by difficulty and similar returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all parts, and most of all at the front part rather than the back part; and the dislocation does not hide itself when you press on it with your fingers or touch according to some figure being dislocated, and when you adjust the wrist, it becomes clear what it is, because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor touch the affected muscle.
And know that when cuts are made, and the dislocation is reduced as soon as possible at the front because it will bring a swollen cauterization, because if you see the cauterized area, it's difficult to reduce it, and little relief is obtained for all; and most of all when it is in the back parts, because it's worse than all other types of dislocation, and more pain, and frequently death follows that kind.
The translation is: And the restoration of him, when it is possible to reduce it, is that his hand be stretched out with both hands, and his arm be stretched out, and the physician's hands are on the joint and let him, and he pushes the joint with the pressure of his palms into its place.
The translation is: But if the dislocation is in the anterior parts, then he returns to that position, where he folds his hand with his own hand, and strikes the joint with the pressure of his palm.
The translation is: And if the dislocation does not obey to the reduction, then he administers violent extension and force.
The translation is: And it is that two ministers will stretch the arm, and hold the extension with two other ministers so that it does not rebound from the force of the extension.
The translation is: And he will turn the arm so that it covers all its parts, as if it were wrapped with a long, folded cloth on his hand, or bandage.
The translation is: And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he applies that area with no oil so that these causes may help in lubrication of the joint and facilitate it, and he pushes the joint with a violent push until it returns.
Let the reduction of the limb be placed on that area where the stiffness and excoriation are most abundant, and it is extended in the direction of the descending structure, and the arm is suspended from the neck, and let it be left for a few days.
And now loosen it; and therefore if the joint is formed in its own place, then you will loosen the ligament of it and relax that.
If you see the joint is not strengthened, then you will apply plaster and ligament, and relax that for several days until it is stabilized; and now loosen that.
But if it happens to him that the gravity of the reduction of the joint occurs and the disposition is in movement, then you administer moisture in bath and subtle friction, compression, until it is alleviated; or place pressure over the joint attached, because it is a great cause of motion; and now tie it, and relax that on bone both day and night. And now fasten that, and put it in bath; and when clean, then you will rub the joint with early friction, and tie over that, because it is a rough motion, one time, and the second, and the third. I have a condition of the bowels.
If you wish, pause over that cow's hide which is wet and flayed at the border, and apply it there with strength on several occasions, for that is moist and reduce its disposition.
Section 28.
The cure for a broken collarbone, which is between the arm and the shoulder.
When the shoulder joint is dislocated, sometimes it's lightly reduced, but in other cases, the opposite is true: the reduction of a dislocation in other joints takes longer to achieve, and however rapid it may be done in the hour the joint is dislocated, it must be done before the pus forms or an abscess occurs on it.
And the reduction of a dislocation is that you place the shoulder joint of the sick person on a table, and the minister extends the arm of that person, and the doctor places his hand or palm over the proximity of the joint, and pushes it in until it returns to its original place.
Joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If you return to it soon, good is; otherwise, hold fast that joint and apply the poultice to the swelling and ease it; and do not go back there, because if so, it will not relieve or you can't reduce it more than what has passed through it in the last few days.
But however the joint is subject to its own tortuosity; and do not notice any disease in the patient, but that the flesh is softened and you cannot tighten any cause; therefore you must know that the nerves are cut or torn, and not that it is tight with cauterization, so apply pressure to it and make it heavier, as this will confer no cause.
Then when the patient has returned, hold over the poultice with which you have previously marked it, and let it rest for four days; and after that, loosen it and let it rest, and make his hand active.
But if the movement of him is maintained and no accidents occur to him with any gravity, then hold that joint in warm water and apply friction a few times, until he is alleviated.

The treatment of dislocation of the finger.
Some times it is found that the finger is completely out of place.
And when any finger is displaced to the two sides of the palm or towards the belly of it, then stretch the finger and drive the displacement back with your thumbs, until you return.
And provide support to the head of the finger and suspend that which is in the part where it is displaced, and let it rest for two days.
And suspend that one and extend the finger into it, so that on the third day it may be set in its place.
And when it cannot be set, use that second method, and do not cease to release that one in the day, and exercise it with movement, and release it at night; and do this for many days until it is straight.
And do the same to it, if it is displaced towards the belly of the hand, and release that one into its former place and perform this operation on it first, until it heals.
It seems to be causing discomfort in other parts of the body.
Similarly, do this also when it is dislocated in other parts.
On the treatment of joint dislocation of the spine.
When any of the spinal bones or neck vertebrae are completely dislocated, and there is removal of the displaced bones from their places, it is not healing, because death comes by the illness.
This is the point where the evacuation of the illness becomes impossible by one's will, and it cannot be retained; and sometimes softening has been observed in some limbs of him or both thighs of him or both knees of him, or one of those; or sometimes a vertebra is removed to its place, for sometimes it is removed and sometimes surgery is performed on the removal of these to four parts.
And then that one is removed to the parts behind and it is called goutiness.
But the treatment for it is that sometimes one considers whether the goutiness occurred in infancy, because then it is not a cure and neither is a complete healing.
Joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And from those it's not cured, but the one that occurs at these two sides in this very place that you are recommending.
And it is because the disease spreads out on his face, near the throat, and is spread with wet tools, so that the foot of him may not be touched.
And they should place a straight stick on it, placed in the earth near the end of the neck around the head of him, and another stick towards the foot of him in the other end of the foot.
And the minister should hold the stick, and not be fixed in the trench; and another minister should hold the other as well, following that form.
And they should wrap a cloth over the head of the sick one and fasten it tightly; then extend the extremity of the ligature to the stick which is for his head, and tie that on him; and prop strong the other ligature over his loins, under his arms, and above his belly, and adjust all the ligatures and tie them to the other stick which is for his feet.

There is a swelling in the extremity of which is formed the fist, the length of which is one palm and it is rotated; and in the two other fists are similar to that.
Propose strengthening the ligaments that you have tied in the foot of the patient in the swelling where it is supposed to be connected to his head, and the ligaments that you have tied in his thighs in the turn where they are supposed to support his feet.
It is necessary to bind any joint and place a minister who ties the joint with his hand, and the doctor wraps up the spine according to what they have said.
The translation is:
And now bring forth the linen bandage which we have spoken about, and use the patient's own foodstuff as subtle nourishment within it to heal.
But if there is any threat remaining at the end of the healing process, then cover it by administering medicines that have been prepared and examining their administration on the table for a long time, which we have recommended; and already administered in that location a layer of lead.
And some unforeseen accidents may happen at the end of the spondylitis on the second vertebra, and it is due to that dislocation; and it is that bone which already threatens to cause you harm with this medication, for heavy iron will do to your accident, mort.
Chapter 31.
On the cure of a dislocated ankle.
Be aware that the joint of the ankle and the muscle do not suffer only from dislocation, but rather a separate injury to those same joints, with swelling and concavity.
And the ankle joint is dislocated in four manners: it can be displaced towards the toes, away from them, or towards the front, or towards the back.
And more so is it displaced in the lower parts of the body, and little in the upper or inner parts.
The cause of the dislocation in the lower parts of the body is that when you adjust the bed of the patient with a healthy person, it becomes longer and the pain is more pronounced than before, the patient cannot bend their knee because of the healthy one, and this is the place where the swollen tongue is stuck, so the head of the hernia has already become trapped here.
The cause of that person who suffers from the dislocation is in the outer parts, because their accidents are contrary to this one.
The cause of that person who suffers from dislocation in the inner parts is that the bladder expands according to its fullness, but more so because they cannot bear the pain that is in the bowels, and if it pushes further and cannot be relieved over there; and the urine of them is retained and the swelling of them is swollen, and therefore the walking of them should be done on the ankle.
The cause of that person who suffers from dislocation in the inner parts is that they do not expand the bowels, nor can they bend the back because it softens the intestine, and their bladder is shorter than another one, and the swelling is softened, and the head of the hernia is stuck at that place.
When the reduction of this dislocation is considered, as is often the case, if the dislocation is old and antiquated, then since it has already passed that you administer a reduction, and follow its disposition, not all; therefore do not cover it up.
Therefore, in that case, if the dislocation is recent and one of the four kinds of dislocations, then you count on it to return to its normal state by turning the joint and stretching those parts towards the digits and the foreparts; and also to that hand which has returned and do not seek any other cure.
However, if it does not return in this manner, then it is likely that you prepare a strong poultice and stretch the fold of his part, or place your hands on him, or bind him with a ligament which is tied over the fold of the said wound; and another servant extends the hand of that person as to meet those hands, which put their hands in the folds of him; and you also apply a strong poultice on the root of the wound, and hold another servant tight to the extremity of the ligament.
The part of the body that has become inflamed or swollen is where the inflammation begins or ends.
If the inflammation extends to all those places on one side, where the illness is elevated above the ground and remains attached.
This type of extension is common to all four.
Therefore if the dislocation returns to that which we have said, it is good; and if not, then it requires all sorts of procedures to talk about one's own cure.
In the reduction of one's own body, when dislocated, and the dislocation is in the lower parts, covering the sickness on its back side; and place the ligatures over the surface at that location where between the head of the cyst and the area left with the tongue.
And another strong minister should take hold of the limbs of it, and press down on the swollen area of the sickness, and extend to the forward parts violently, so that what returns to its place.
This condition has a lighter cure than which other members are reduced to.
But if it is excused from your treatment and you do not obey to this type of cure for the whole body, then cover that the two legs of the patient are tied with strong, lighter, straps on both feet and both ankles.
Is it the length of any part by the quantity of four words, and is the patient's thigh extended more than the other by two words.
And place the patient's body over the saddle, so that it is above the seat, and its length corresponds to two arms.
And command a young man strong to compress the head of the hernia, and place it on another young man, while the other young man compresses it with force, so that the joint returns to its place at speed.
But in the reduction itself, when it is dislocation at the point outside, cover that the hernia presses on a stool according to what has been counted in the way they have prepared; and strengthen the tie over the patient's cavity and over his foot.
The translation is:
And have any minister extend to his part, and the doctor wraps his hand in the reduction according to art.
And when dislocation occurs in the front parts, it is customary to spread the cushion lightly, and it is according to this middle narration about the knee; and the doctor places the palm of his hand directly over the inflamed joint, and removes that other hand, and applies that cutaneous pressure to stop that displacement at those left parts, just as far as the joint.
And if dislocation occurs in the back parts, it is not customary for the inflammation to be spread to those left parts, and it is elevated above the earth; however, it should be padded with a hard surface, just as one would apply an extension if the joint is dislocated outward, according to what has been said about the junction of two joints; and its face and ligaments are stretched out, according to what has been said, there is no better way.
The treatment of compression on a table over the location where the joint is.
Then when the reduction is completed, according to what you know - and don't hide from yourself, for the sign of the reduction of that limb isn't hidden to you, you extend the patient's two legs, and when you tie those strings and stretch the patient's leg, expand the skin in that area, and whenever you see that the member is returned - then adjust two cushions and place a bandage around it so that no swelling occurs on any part; and attach the wound to rest for three days or four.
And then carefully remove the bandage and adhesive, and compare one leg to the other.
And then, if you see those strings in its entirety, you will know that the dislocation is already fixed, and therefore lightly take the wound.
And if you see any cause of softening, then return and apply that one, and extend it as in your first structure, and lightly touch it on three days.
And place that person on the way to recovery for as many days as possible before they are mobile again.
Chapter thirty-two.
On the cure of a broken limb.
The limb is dislocated in three manners: it can be dislocated outwardly, inwardly, or leftwardly (toward the back), and not downward.
And the sign of a broken limb is that commands the sick person to apply their cushion over the wound; then it seems like the bone is broken.
And the restoration for all of these manners is that you make a cut on the sick person's flesh, in such a way that it extends their own cushion; then take your two hands to his face, and place your foot between his feet; and then place your hand adhering to his broken bone, with your palms, and bind those between your fingers over the broken limb with strength, and another servant extends their foot until the bone returns to its place.
The translated line is: And so when you have made a return, it should be that their cushion adheres to the space with non-weight bearing.
And so you should place that one and have the cushion adhere to the space, and you should tie those ones with a bandage for three days or four, and then untie them.
Do not use the bed of ambulance for more than three days, until the person is recovered and relieved.
However, if the reduction of your hand is postponed, then give more extensive stretching to the ligaments of which in the treatment of the preceding fractured arm.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle sometimes gets mended by small mobilization, and sometimes it is dislocated according to the degree, and the dislocation of it is done in the medial partitions or in the anterior partitions.
And so, the sign of the ankle's dislocation is that it swells before reaching the part to which it is dislocated.
May the cure of removal be through gentle return, and that it may become easy to apply with great care before returning.
May the cure of him when he is dislocated in a correct manner be easy to do, and that you make clean the wound deeply, and hold one strong and brave minister behind the two joints of him in the middle place of him.
And take your right hand to the upper part of the foot, and your left hand to the lower part of the foot in the place of the cavity.
And lift the foot with your right hand, and hold it with your left hand for two times, then extend the left hand; and push the foot down with the heel of the foot towards the cushion so that the foot may work.
And do this twice, as agreed upon.
And push the foot down into the cushion for the third time, and you are at the cavity.
Then if you return in one turn or two according to this manner, and if you press the foot together, it is good; but if not, longs as you repeat the operation, because that returns.
If it is forbidden to reduce the swelling with what you have at hand, then place the ulcer on its back over the ground, and put a padded cloth on top of the ground, and that which will enclose between the patient's thighs, and you already have wrapped the patient in a sheet so that they do not lose their ulcer.
And place the minister's thighs on top of them, and another minister extend the leg over its hands or a towel that lies on the neck of the leg; and another minister extend itself against the extension of its belly, so that the cloth is extended between the patient's thighs, retaining what is inside, in order that its swelling does not be directed to those parts from which it deviates.
And place the doctor on one side, and another minister hold the healthy cavity to those parts that are left, because the dislocation returns with ease.
And therefore when the dislocation returns and you declare the state of the reduction, then put on plaster and extend that which lies firmly under it, and tie the leg with a bandage to the cushion.
I fear or take precautions of the nerves that are behind the heel, lest the ligature over them be violent and cause a great torment.
And stretch it for two days or three, and if the ligature is softened, extend that.
And lift it on the fourth day or on the eighth, and prohibit the patient from lying for forty days. However, if it is necessary to enter that space again, there is no secure safety that the dislocation will not be dissolved and corrupted, and therefore do not apply to it.
If it happens to the apothema (wound), then fear that you will administer in the excision of it, as explained before in another location of cure and embrocation, until it is closed.
The End.
On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Joints of the Feet.
So that the one who is dislocated be reduced with little extension of effort; and this which is not difficult, it is lighter.
If the dislocation is in the middle of the heel bone, then always cover that the patient's foot with a woolen cloth or over a table, and so it should be as if they had gone.
And place you on your side, and put that your foot over it which lies near the joints, and place a calkan on your foot so that it remains inside until you return, and look for that it is already covered up and does not appear in the high part.
And place their belly of the foot on a table that holds the whole foot, which has two caps, and tighten that one by binding structure decently and firmly for three days; and after removing it, let him rest with walking for some days, until he is strengthened and ensured of his cure.
Chapter XXXV.
Of the kinds of dislocations that are caused by injury or fracture, or of any other cause.
When any of those causes occur and you perforse yourself in the wound of that and in the restoring of him, many frequently succeed with death.
Joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. Forcedly, you must now immediately do from him of the reduction in the beginning of the cause, just as I have previously mentioned to perform an apsectomy caut.
And then if the member returns according to what you want, you will immediately administer a regimen that cuts an apsectomy caut and treats the plague as it suits, for this is the remedy of dry coughs.
And if a dislocation occurs with a fracture and the separated bones cause injury, then you will perform the statement of their order, and do in this way what has been said in simple illnesses of this sort, which precedes in those areas.
And be careful and avoid along the way according to your judgment which precedes my preaching; for this is better for you than it is good for me, and more stable in my glory, and more blessings to you true in your time those are which you will see. Thus I finish the words of Albucasis perfectly as if God had blessed them. End of text.
