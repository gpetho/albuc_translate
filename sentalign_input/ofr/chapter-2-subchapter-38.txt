Many times a bone or fishbone, or some other thing, gets stuck in the throat; so you must remove what you can see, and press the tongue down with the instrument, so that you can see the object move; and what you cannot see and is stuck in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the stuck object will come out through vomiting; or the patient can swallow a piece of sponge, or a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it reaches the spot, it will stick, and then you pull it out; and if it does not come out with what we have said, then take a lead instrument shaped like this:
And the instrument should be curved at the end so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the end raised upwards; and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, lest choking occur, and do not push the bone further in; and it is better that the patient inserts the instrument, because they know better where the object is stuck; then they swallow it, or pull it out with the same instrument, until it is removed.
