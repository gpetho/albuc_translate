Chapter Seven
On cauterization for chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and you have treated it with what we have mentioned and your treatment has not been successful and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizations.
On each side of his head a cauterization, and a cauterization in the middle of the head as we have mentioned, and a cauterization at the back of the head as previously stated.
The description of the cauteries is as above.  He may also be cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach, which would be more effective. Then treat as above.
