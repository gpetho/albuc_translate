Chapter Thirty on Cauterizing the Spleen
If you treat a disease of the spleen with the treatment we mentioned in the division and your treatment does not succeed, then cauterizing it has three aspects, all of which are correct, one of which is to cauterize it three or four cauterizations aligned along the length of the spleen, in the form of liver cauterizations, whose form we presented previously, and the space between each cauterization should be the width of a finger or slightly more, and the character of the cautery iron is the same character that we mentioned in the cauterization of the liver, and do not deepen your hand with the cautery, and the image of the sick person is lying on his back.
And the other aspect is in the elbow, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the elbow of the sick person ends, the elbow, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the left elbow of the sick person ends, and your lifting of the skin should be across the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body, then you insert the two skewers, very protected, until they penetrate the skin from the other side, then you remove the cautery iron, so the cauterizations are four.
And if you wish to cauterize with the other cautery iron, which has three skewers, then treat the cauterized area after you leave it to drain pus for many days, then it is more effective than all of what preceded from the treatment.
