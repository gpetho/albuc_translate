Â¶ On the restoration of a chest fracture.
Chapter VIII.
The chest is sometimes fractured in the middle, and this rarely occurs.
Indeed, its ends are mostly fractured and crushed due to accidents.
When its middle part fractures, which slopes downward, and severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and cough occur: and perhaps he vomits blood, and a concavity is visible in the broken bone, and it is not hidden from the senses. Its restoration is achieved by having the patient lie on his back: and placing a cushion between his shoulder blades.
Then press his shoulders and bring together the ribs on both sides with your hands: and smooth them in alignment, in every way possible and fitting, until the shape of the bone returns to what is required.
Then place a plaster and wool over it, and place a splint from a thin board of willow, or poplar, and others similar in lightness, after wrapping it in cloth.
Then carefully bind it over the broken bone, so it does not move: and take the bandage around to the back several times, and tighten it with appropriate compression.
Then inspect the binding every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if there is a need to loosen it due to itching, or erosion at the site, or pain, or swelling, then quickly loosen it, remove the plaster, and correct what has happened with the appropriate treatment.
Then replace the plaster, if you see it necessary: and attach the compression until it heals.
