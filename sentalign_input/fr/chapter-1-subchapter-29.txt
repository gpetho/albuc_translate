of the cautery for pleurisy
The ancients said that one should make cauteries for pleurisy with roots of aristolochia, in this manner: take a long root of aristolochia, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and as thick and as long as your fingers; soak it in oil, and put it over the fire, then cauterize one cautery between the shoulder blade and the neck, and two small cauteries descending a little in the area below the beard; two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, declining slightly backward; one cautery in the middle of the chest, another on the stomach, one between the two shoulders, and two on the sides of the chest near the cautery between the two shoulders; and do not press your hand, rather make it openly as if you were smelling.
And some ancients said that some use an iron cautery resembling a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess; the pain jumps out, as we have said in the abscess of the liver. But in this work, there is a fear that the patient may die immediately, or a fistula may form that cannot be healed.
