of the cough
When a cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the illness is chronic, then make two cauterizations on the chest in empty places; and another cauterization in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be the one called "clavile" according to the form previously described.
And if you wish, make a cauterization by pricking with the entire cautery which is called "points," of which the form is found earlier in the discussion of ear ailments; and let there be up to 30 pricks, or thereabouts.
Afterwards treat the area according to what has been said before, and let the cautery have three prongs according to this form:
And because of this the cauteries are easier, because you make three at once.
