The author of this book, having completed for you, my children, this book, which is a complete part of the science of medicine, and having reached its ultimate clarity and explanation, has seen fit to complete it for you with this section, which is a part of practical application.
Because practical application is completely lacking in our country and in our time, so much so that the science of it is almost forgotten and its trace is lost. But only a few traces of it remain in the books of the ancients, which have been corrupted by hands and distorted by error and confusion, so that its meanings are obscure and its benefit distant.
Therefore, I have seen fit to revive it and compose this section on it through explanation, clarity, and summarization, and to present the images of cautery irons and other instruments of practice, since this is an addition to the explanation and contains what is needed.
The reason that there is no skilled practitioner with skilled hands in our time is that the craft of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first practice the science of anatomy, as described by Galen. So that he may understand the benefits of the organs, their nature and humors, their connections and separations, and the knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, their number and exits, the pulsating and non-pulsating veins, and the locations of their exits.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are numerous in name but few in deed, especially in the craft of the hand.  We have mentioned a part of this in the introduction of this book.
Because whoever is not knowledgeable about the anatomy we have mentioned is liable to commit errors that kill people, as I have witnessed many who imagined themselves knowledgeable in this field and claimed it without knowledge or understanding.
I saw an ignorant physician who incised a swine's-nose tumor on a woman's neck, and severed some of the neck's arteries, causing the woman to bleed to death before his eyes.
I saw another physician who advanced in removing a stone from an old man, and the stone was large.  He acted rashly and removed it with a piece of bladder tissue. The man died about three days later.  I was called to remove it, and upon seeing the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I realized that I could not have done it.
And I saw another physician who practiced medicine for hire among some of the merchants of our city.
A black boy, with a fracture near his heel and a wound, came to him.  The physician, in his ignorance, quickly bound the fracture to the wound tightly with splints and bandages, not leaving any breathing space for the wound.
Then he yielded to his desires, and left him for days, ordering him not to loosen the bandage until his leg and foot swelled, and he was on the verge of death.
So I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandage. He found relief and was free from his pain, but the corruption had already become firmly established in the limb, and I could not prevent it.
The corruption continued to spread throughout the limb until he died.
I saw another physician treat a malignant tumor.  After a few days, it ulcerated, and the patient's condition worsened.  This is because if the cancer is purely composed of black humors, it should never be treated with iron.
Unless it is in a limb that can be entirely removed.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two categories: work that is accompanied by safety, and work that, in most cases, results in injury.
I have warned in every instance in this book about work that involves risk and fear, and you should avoid it.
So that the ignorant do not find a way to speak ill of you, be firm and cautious, and be gentle and steadfast in your treatment.
Use the best path leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid serious and difficult-to-cure illnesses.
Keep yourselves free from what you fear might cause doubt in your religion and your worldly affairs, for it is more lasting for your reputation and raises your standing in this world and the next.
Galen said in some of his precepts: Do not treat a disease poorly and thus become a poor physician.
This article is divided into three chapters.
Chapter one.
In cauterization by fire and cauterization by a sharp medicine, a chapter is presented, arranged from the heel to the foot, and showing the instruments, cauterizing tools, and all that is needed for manual work.
And the second chapter.
Concerning incision, lancing, phlebotomy, cupping, surgery, extraction of arrows, and the like, all presented in an organized manner, with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third chapter.
Concerning fractures, dislocations, treatment of sprains, and the like, presented in an organized manner from the heel to the foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first chapter.
Concerning cauterization.
Before describing its application, it is necessary to discuss its benefits, drawbacks, and in which temperament it is used.
I say that discussing the benefits and drawbacks of cauterization, its detailed science, and hidden secrets, is a lengthy discourse and a subject of deep knowledge which many wise men have discussed.
I have condensed the limited amount of their discourse, fearing to become verbose.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for all bad temperaments with or without material, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without material and the dry temperament without material.
As for the dry temperament with material, they differed. Some said that cauterization is beneficial, while others argued the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for an illness resulting from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured of a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry remedy.  The one who argues the opposite said that cauterization with fire might benefit from a hot, dry disease that occurs in human bodies. Because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the human body cold.
And I say with him, because experience has shown me that repeatedly, although it should not be imagined in this matter except by one who has diligently practiced and trained in the art of cauterization to a great degree. And he must understand the differences in the temperaments of people, the nature of diseases themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially cold, moist diseases, for all physicians have agreed on them, and there is no disagreement concerning the benefit of cauterization in them.
Know, my children, that the secret of treatment by cauterization with fire and its superiority over cauterization with a burning medicine is because fire is a simple element whose effect is limited to the organ cauterized and it does not harm another connected organ except in a minor way.
Cauterization with burning medicine, however, may extend its effect to other organs and perhaps induce a disease in the organ that is difficult to treat, or even kill it.  Fire, owing to its nobility and purity of essence, will not do this unless it is excessive.
This has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of service, care in the craft, and understanding the truth of the matter.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy explanations.  Were it not unbefitting this book of mine, I would have presented to you the secret and method of fire's action on bodies and its removal of diseases using a precise philosophical and demonstrative discourse beyond your comprehension.
Know, my children, that there is disagreement concerning the appropriate time for cauterization, and they consider spring to be the best time.
I say that cauterization is suitable in any time, for the harm caused by the time is absorbed by the benefit brought about by the cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for a strong, necessary ailment, a deferred one that cannot be delayed, lest a greater harm results than the minor damage caused by time.
Do not, my children, consider what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization, which cures a disease, never returns and treat it as a curse.
This is not as you have imagined, for cauterization is like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries the humidity which is the cause of the ailments.
However, cauterization is preferred to medicine because of its speed of success, strength of action, and intensity of its power.
The disease may return sometime in the future, depending on the patient's temperament, the strength and severity of the disease, the accumulation of harmful elements in the body, and the patient's neglect in acquiring appropriate nourishment, and similar causes.
Unless the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild disease in a part of the body with few harmful elements and humidity. For example, cauterizing a tooth for pain, and similar cases, the pain may not return, and this will be at least the case.
Also, the common saying that cauterization is the final stage of medicine is a correct statement, not in the way they believe, for they think there is no treatment that will be useful, with or without medicine, after cauterization, but the matter is different.
The meaning of "cauterization is the final stage of medicine" is that when we have used various treatments for a disease and those remedies have not been effective, and then we use cauterization as the last resort, and it is successful, then in this case, cauterization is the final stage of medicine. Not in the sense understood by the general public and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients stated that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron.  They said this because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its substance, and they said that the cauterized area does not fester.  However, this is not universally true.
Because I have experimented and found that this is only true in some bodies and not others.  Cauterization with gold is better and superior to iron, as they said, except that if you heat a gold cautery in fire, you cannot readily determine when it has been heated to the desired degree of gold's redness.
Because cold quickly reaches it, and if you increase its heat in the fire, it melts and fuses, causing the craftsman to be involved in extra work.  Therefore, cauterization with iron is, in our opinion, quicker and closer to correct for practical application, God willing.
I have organized this chapter on cauterization into sections, arranged from head to foot, to make it easier for the student to find what he needs, God willing.
The First Chapter.
Cauterization of the head: one cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for excess moisture and cold in the brain, which are the cause of headaches, frequent colds running from the head down to the eye and ear areas, excessive sleepiness, toothaches, and sore throats. Generally, for all diseases caused by cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and stupor, and similar ailments.
The procedure for this cauterization is that the patient should first be made to vomit with a purgative medicine which cleanses the head for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and usual habits.
Then, order him to shave his head with a razor, and then have him sit before you, squatting, with his hands placed on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes.  Wherever your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-oil cauterizing iron, which has this form.
If the bone is exposed to the extent of a needle's head or the size of a carbuncle, raise your hand; otherwise, reheat the iron, or use another if the first has cooled. Until you see the bone as I described, then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a piece of cotton in it. Place it on the affected area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton swab soaked in clarified butter and leave it on until the burning sensation subsides.  Then treat it with the four-part ointment until it heals, God willing.
They said that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus it produces, and this is better and more beneficial.
Some have said to cauterize the skin down to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the bone's thickness is burned.  Then, to remove the burned bone, and then to treat the wound.
Others said that it is necessary to use excessive cauterization, affecting the bone strongly, until it falls off like a small piece of charcoal or a small particle. They claimed that this releases head vapors from the area and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then treat until it heals. I do not at all see these two types of cauterization as beneficial, except for some people, and in a reckless manner.  Leaving it untreated is better in my opinion, and with safety, because the head weakens when its natural connections are disrupted, as we have observed in other organs.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion.  Use it, and you will be safe, God willing.
Second Chapter.
Concerning cauterization of the head also.
If a chronic pain arises throughout the head, afflicting the patient, and if applications, fomentations, whippings, ointments, and dressings have been used, especially if a single cauterization, which we have described, has not helped, then examine. If the patient's head is strong by nature and not weak, and if he experiences intense cold, cauterize again slightly above the previous one. Then cauterize each horn of his head with a cautery until the thickness of the skin is gone and the bone is exposed to the extent we have described. And cauterize with a cautery at the back of his head, in the area known as the "axe" [spot].  Be gentle here, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience intense pain unlike the pain of the other head cauterizations. I will mention this cautery in its proper place.
The cautery used for the horns and back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used for the middle of the head.  This is its image/form.
Chapter Three.
For the non-chronic sister's cautery.
If pain occurs in the head's fissure, accompanied by a headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then the patient should be purged with drugs that clear the head.  Use all other treatments that I have mentioned in the categories of illnesses. If that does not succeed, the cautery should be applied in two ways. Either by cautery with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
As for cautery with a burning medicine, take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides. Then, slit the affected area of the temple with a wide scalpel, until a space is created under the skin that will accommodate the clove.
Insert it into the skin until it disappears. Then, apply firm pressure with a bandage. Leave it for approximately fifteen hours, then remove it and take out the garlic. Allow the wound to heal for two or three days, then apply a dressing.
Apply a cotton ball soaked in ghee until the area becomes suppurated.  Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you wish, you can accomplish this with some of the burning medicines that I have presented in the eighteenth article on burning medicines.
And as for cauterizing it with iron, it is done in this way: Heat the cautery iron, which has this shape:.
It is called a nail-shaped cautery because its head is shaped like a nail, with some ridges, and a small projection in the center.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while gently rotating the iron.  The amount of skin burned should be about half its thickness. Raise your hand so as not to burn the artery beneath it and cause bleeding, then soak a cotton ball in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then coat the cotton with ghee, and treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, cauterize this wound with the sharp, knife-like end of the cautery, and take care to avoid cutting the artery in this particular chronic wound.
Chapter Four.
Treating chronic wounds.
If you have treated the wound with the aforementioned treatments and the treatments mentioned in the sections on diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you see a cause that does not respond to the initial cauterization with medicine or fire cauterization. You should heat the knife-like cautery until it glows white, after tracing the painful area with a line about half a finger in length or similar.  Hold it once, tightening it until the artery is cut and you reach the bone.
However, you must be careful not to touch the jaw that moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or nerve that moves it, causing spasm.
Be cautious and vigilant regarding the bleeding from the artery you cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for someone unfamiliar with the procedure and lacking proven experience; abandoning the treatment is preferable.
Treatment of accidental bleeding from the artery will be discussed in its proper place in the book, God willing. If you see a condition that this cauterization will not address, then...
And if you see the patient's body capable of tolerating it, cauterize the scalp in the center as we described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, you may use the cauterization we described in the chapter on treating arteries with the two-bladed cautery; it is a better and more effective cauterization than this one.
Chapter Five.
On cauterizing earaches.
If an earache occurs due to a cold, and it has been treated with laxatives and other remedies that we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not subside, cauterize the ear with the cautery called the "point," which is depicted in this image.
Then, after heating it, apply it around the entire ear, or around both ears if the pain is in both, as you would rotate it around. Move the cautery slightly away from the base of the ear after marking the spot with ink. The cautery should be about ten points in size for each ear, or thereabouts. Then, treat the affected areas until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Six.
On cauterization with the cautery.
The abscesses that are treated with cauterization are of the type that arise from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
One should avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
If, having treated this type of abscess with poultices, massage, and gargles, your treatment has not been successful, then the affected area should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization should be performed as follows:  One cauterization should be applied opposite the upper part of the ear, slightly below the crown of the head, and another in the temple, and its length should be the same as the length of the thumb.
Bring your cauterizing implement down until you have burned approximately half the thickness of the skin.  This is the image of the cauterizing iron, a type of blade previously described, but slightly gentler as you see. The blade should have a slightly increased thickness, then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On cauterization for chronic stroke.
If the stroke is chronic and you have treated it as we have described, and your treatment is unsuccessful and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize four times. One cauterization on each temple, one cauterization in the middle of the head, as we mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head, as previously described.
Using the cautery as previously described, and a cauterization might also be applied to the mouth of the stomach, which would be more effective, then treat as previously described.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
One afflicted with phlegmatic forgetfulness should first be given large doses of emetics and purgatives that clear the brain.
Then his entire head is shaved and a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on dressings, is applied to his back repeatedly; for it is a form of cauterization.
And do this in exactly the same way as mentioned there. If he is cured by this, then stop. Otherwise, cauterize three times on the back of his head, arranged in a line from the top of his head to the base of his neck.
Leave a finger's breadth between each cauterization.  Then treat the cauterization as previously described. If you want to increase the treatment and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you wish to increase the treatment, cauterize the temples. Then treat it until he is healed. The cautery should be olive-shaped, in the manner previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterization for paralysis and relaxation of the entire body.
One should proceed with cleansing the head with the remedies previously mentioned. Then shave the patient's head and cauterize a mark in the center of the head, a mark on each temple, and a mark on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck.  If, in a case of relaxation of the body, more than that is required and the patient can tolerate it, and the disease is strong and firmly established, cauterize four marks on the vertebrae of his back. Cauterize until most of the skin is burned, then raise your hand. Then treat it as previously mentioned until it is healed, God willing.  Use an olive oil-based cautery.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterization for epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is due to phlegm should be cauterized.  First, his brain should be cleansed with large cupping glasses and with all the other treatments we have described in the classification, if the patient is large and can tolerate medication.
However, if he is a child who cannot tolerate medication, then he should use gargles and cleansing mouthwashes for the brain many days before, while improving his diet.
Then his head should be shaved, and one cauterization should be performed in the middle of the head, as previously described in the description, and another cauterization in the back of the head. And a cauterization on each temple of the head.  If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize with the cauterizations mentioned in the case of paralysis and weakness of the body on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae.  The cautery should be olive-shaped, in the manner described previously.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
In cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is putrid moisture and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauterizations we mentioned in the case of paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is excess tending towards black bile and the patient's body is moist and corrupt, evacuate what purifies the brain as previously described in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of linen like a circle, then place it in the center of the head while the patient sits upright and holds it from all sides. Then take one pound of old sheep's butter.
Then heat it over a moderate fire, to the point where a finger can tolerate it when inserted.  Then pour it into the circle on the patient's head, and let it cool. Do this once a week with the rest of your good treatment until, God willing, he is cured.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small, scattered points, without holding the cauterizing iron in your hand, but rather by a light touch, for this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a linen cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
Concerning cauterizing water that flows from the eye.
If you perceive the initial signs of water flowing from the eye as described in the classifications, then promptly treat the patient.  Clear his head, protect it from all moisture, and sweat him in a bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize with a cautery in the center of the head, and then cauterize twice on the temples if the water is flowing from both eyes, or on the temple of the affected side if only one eye is affected.
Then, with the cautery, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin, and let the cauterizations be long and wide over the temples. Take precautions against bleeding.
If you see anything of it [the affected area], cut it at the site with any treatment possible.  We will discuss the wisdom of dealing with arteries, and their cutting while preventing bleeding.
He may be cauterized twice deeply on the back of the head, beneath the bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and originate from veins and arteries on the exterior of the head, and you are certain that it is due to thick, cold, phlegmatic excess, cauterize it using the cautery method described for the initial, descending water. One cautery in the center of the head, two cauteries on the temples, and two cauteries on the back of the head beneath the bones. If further cauterization is required, cauterize on each side of the eye's tail at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing foul odors of the nose.
If treatment with the methods described in the classification is unsuccessful, promptly cauterize the patient's temples for three nights.  Then shave his head and cauterize the middle area with the olive-oil cautery iron. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery iron, two cauteries above the eyebrows, slightly under the hair.  Protect the artery; do not sever it.  This is the image of the nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to disease or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize above the eyebrows, two cauteries on each side, spaced apart from the temples.  The length of each cautery should be the length of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the cauterization, but only to the point where one-third of the skin is burned.  The cautery iron should be of this shape.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its eyelashes turn inward, injuring the eye, then there are two types of cauterization for it. Either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.  As for cauterizing with fire, first order the patient to remove his eyelashes, if he is one who plucks them, so that they grow long and even.
If he has been injured while they are growing, then bind his eyes with a bandage so they do not move until they grow.  When they have grown and evened out, place the patient's head on your lap. Then mark the eyelid with ink, in the shape of a willow leaf.
Begin the mark near the eyelashes. Then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a badger under the eyelid.  Then heat an iron, this is its image.
Then cauterize in the shape you marked, little by little, in many applications, until the surface of the skin, which is entirely like the shape of the willow leaf, is burned.  A sign of your successful work is to see that the eyelid is rolled back and the hair is raised off the eye's flesh.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days. Then apply a cotton ball with ghee until the scab is removed, then treat it with ointment until it is healed, God willing. If any hair grows back after a time and the eyelid relaxes.
Then repeat the cauterization in that place as you did at first. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not prick the eye.  As for cauterization with the burning medicine, instruct the patient to leave the eyelashes until they grow long and even.
Then make a picture of a willow leaf from paper. Then take from the usual soap and quicklime, each one a weight of a dirham or the like.  Grind them both well, and do this quickly, so they do not dry. Then spread some of this mixture onto the paper you made, shaped like a willow leaf, and place it on the eyelid, either one or both. Place a cotton ball soaked in egg white under the eye and the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on the medicine and press it gently, moving it as the patient feels the burning of the medicine, because it causes a burning sensation like fire.  As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And see if you find the eyelid has risen, as it rises with cauterization by fire or by cutting. Otherwise, apply more of the medicine to the area where it hasn't taken effect and hasn't blackened, until you have completed your work and the eye has been cauterized.  Then place cotton with oil on it until the burning subsides.
Then treat it with palm ointment or another, until it heals. You should take utmost care during the procedure that no medicine falls into the eye.  If the eyelid loosens after a few days and we fear something from the hair in the eye.
Then reapply the medicine to that loosened area of the eyelid, specifically, as you did initially, and treat it until it heals. This is an illustration of a willow leaf.
Know that people's eyes vary in size and age.  Therefore, adjust your cauterization accordingly.  The correct method is not hidden from one who has experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the fistula that appears in the eye's eyelid.
If you have treated the fistula with the methods we described in the sections on diseases, and your treatment has not been successful, then it is necessary to cauterize it in this way.
Instruct the patient to place his head on your lap, and have an attendant hold the head firmly in your hands, without allowing any movement or shaking of the head.
Then place a cotton swab moistened with egg white or with the juice of the prickly pear on his eyes, and then heat the cautery, which is pictured as follows.
It should be hollowed out, like the shaft of an eagle's feather on one end, where the cautery will be applied; if you prefer, the other end can be pierced or solid, like a cylinder; however, the hollowed-out type is better for your procedure, God willing.
Then, if the fistula is open, squeeze it to remove the matter, and dry it; or if it is not open, open it and remove the pus.  Then, place the extremely hot cautery on it, holding it with your hand until you reach the bone.
Keep your hand slightly away from the eye toward the nose when applying the cautery, so that your hand does not miss or the patient becomes agitated, causing the cautery to fall onto the eyelid and damage it.  If the bone is reached on the first application, then do nothing more; otherwise, repeat the process with the cautery if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton soaked in oil and treat it with a dried ointment until it heals. If forty days pass without healing, apply a strong, corrosive medicine to expose the bone and treat it as described in the appropriate section, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula, mentioned by some early scholars, involves approaching the fistula site, incising it, and then placing a thin funnel within the incision – this is its image.
Pour in melted lead weighing a dirham, holding the funnel firmly and steadily in your hand.  The patient must remain absolutely still so that the melted lead does not drip into their eye.  A cotton pad soaked in egg white or water should be placed over the patient's eye.
The lead burns the fistula, curing it remarkably.  If the fistula heals with the described cautery and treatment, then do nothing more; otherwise, the nasal passage must be opened and the fistula returned to its proper nasal channel, as will be discussed in its specific section.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing a cleft lip.
A cleft in the lip, often called a fissure, frequently occurs, especially in the lips of boys.  If the cleft, treated as described in the classification, does not yield, then heat a small, knife-like cautery iron in this manner...
Make its cavity as thin as a knife, then place it, hot, quickly into the cleft itself until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft.  Then treat it with qirrot, so that it may heal, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing a fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a tumor appears at the base of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then ulcerates and bursts, forming a fistula from the pus, and treatment is unsuccessful, then a cautery iron should be heated to a size appropriate for the fistula.
Then, insert it, hot, into the fistula's opening, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its bottom and end.  Do this once or twice, then treat it subsequently with the remedies mentioned previously, until it heals, God willing.
If the material is severed and it heals, then well and good. Otherwise, the area must be examined and any corrupt bone removed, as will be described in its respective section, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Loose teeth and gums.
If the gums have loosened due to moisture, and the teeth have shifted, and medication has been ineffective, then place the patient's head in your lap, and heat the cauterizing iron, whose image will come later, after placing the tube on the tooth.
Quickly insert the hot cauterizing iron, hold your hand for a short time until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth, then remove your hand, then repeat the procedure with the cauterizing iron as many times as desired, and then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water.
He should hold it for an hour and spit it out. Then the loose tooth will become firm, the relaxed gums will tighten, and the putrid moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-one.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is due to cold or worms, and medication is ineffective, cauterization can be performed in two ways: either with oil or with fire.
As for cauterization with oil, take cow's ghee and boil it in an iron ladle or a shell. Then take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the end of a probe, dip it in the hot ghee, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, holding it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.  Alternatively, you can dip wool or cotton in cold ghee, place it on the aching tooth, and then apply a heated iron on top until the fire reaches the tooth's base.
As for cauterization with fire, use a copper or iron tube, somewhat thick-walled to prevent the heat from reaching the patient's mouth. Then heat the cautery iron, place it on the same tooth, and hold it until it cools, repeating this several times.
The pain will subside either on the same day or the next.  Following the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good ghee and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  This is the form of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you choose, as appropriate.  This is the form of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing pigs.
If pigs are affected by phlegm and cold humors, and do not respond to maturation with medicines, and you want rapid maturation, heat the hollow cautery, the form of which is depicted here, with two pierced ends.
To allow smoke to exit from the other end during the cauterization, apply the protected cautery to the same tumor once and again if needed, until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery the same size as the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton pad soaked in clarified butter to remove what was burned by fire. Then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
Chapter twenty-three.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If phlegm predominates in the trachea, especially if accompanied by a cold temperament, the patient should first be purged with laxative remedies, then cauterized with a cautery at the notch of the neck, near the base of the throat, at the lowest point.
Be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, and burn only half a finger's breadth of skin. Then cauterize another time at the joint of the neck, at the last bead of it, vigorously.  Use a nail-shaped cautery as described previously.
Then treat him with what was previously mentioned until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and there is no fever or consumption in the patient, and the illness is chronic, cauterize twice above the collarbones, in the soft, empty, lower areas, and once more in the center of the chest between the breasts.
And the cauterizing iron should be pointed, as described previously.  If you prefer, let your cauterization be by dripping with the cauterizing iron called the "point," and its image was previously given in the section on cauterizing ear pain.  The points should be approximately thirty in number.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he is cured.  A cauterizing iron with three prongs may be made in this manner, and it is used for quicker cauterization because you can apply three cauterizations at once; this is the image of the cauterization iron.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery moisture or if it is not properly secured after reduction, so that it habitually relocates and then dislocates at the slightest movement, as we have observed, then the joint should first be reduced. Then the patient lies on their back or on their right side, and the skin inside the armpit is lifted upwards with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inward.
Then the double-bladed cautery, whose image is this, is heated.
Then the skin is cauterized with it until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization is four cauterizations.  It may be cauterized with a three-bladed cautery, and the shape of the cauterization will then be six cauterizations, with the blades placed along the thickness of the tissue.
This is the image of the three-bladed cautery.
And one may be added to this number, making the cauterizations eight. Then, the crushed balls with salt are applied to the cauterization, and the patient must keep the affected area still and not move the limb for a time until it strengthens.  If the dislocation is upward, it is rare.
Cauterize above the shoulder with one good, nail-like cautery, or several small dots, then the joint will strengthen, the moisture will disappear, and the patient will recover.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If the stomach is afflicted with cold and excessive moisture, to the point of deranging its temperament, and frequent discharges occur, and various treatments have been ineffective, then the patient should lie on their back with legs and arms extended, and three cauterizations should be performed. Cauterize below the breastbone, to the extent of a finger, with a nail-like cautery iron.  And cauterize two more points, each below the sides of the first cautery, so the cauteries form a triangle. Maintain a distance between them, lest they merge if they become infected.  The depth of the cauterization should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and the shape of the cauterizations should be…
In this manner and to this degree, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cautery in the middle of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery iron used for this single cauterization should be circular in shape, in this manner.
The stomach may also be cauterized by點, for those who fear this cauterization.  Mark points on the stomach to the desired extent with ink, then cauterize them with a pointed cautery iron, and then treat with the previous treatment until healed.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
Concerning cauterization of the cold liver.
If a cold and moist ailment or a hot wind, which has exceeded its natural state, arises from the liver, and the patient has been treated as described in the classification, and that treatment has not been successful. Then the patient should lie on their back, and three cauteries should be marked with ink, precisely this shape and size, on the liver, below the collarbones, where the human elbow ends.
And after each cautery, there should be a finger's breadth between each cautery.  The cauterization should be along the body, straight, and do not press the iron down hard.
Let the burn mark on the skin's thickness be no more than half of that, no more.  The patient should be standing on their feet, or if not able to stand, lying with legs extended and arms raised.  This is the shape of the cautery iron.
You may cauterize these marks with a knife-like cautery iron, if you have skill and dexterity in the craft, and be careful not to overdo the cauterization, burning all the skin, burning the abdomen, and reaching the intestines.  The skin there is thin, so know this.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
For cauterizing a tumor of the liver.
If a boil appears on the liver, and you wish to know whether the tumor is in the liver's flesh or its membrane, if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient will experience heaviness and pain, but without intensity.
And if it is in the liver's membrane, the pain will be accompanied by intense sharpness, and if you see that the physicians have exhausted its treatment, then the patient should lie on his back, and the swollen area should be marked with ink.
Then, the cautery, which resembles a shovel, should be heated in the fire; this is its image. Cauterize it with a single cauterization, until all the skin is burned and the cauterization reaches the membrane, so that the entire pus is removed; then treat it with the treatment for boils until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be performed by someone who has extensive experience in medicine and has treated these diseases repeatedly; only then should one attempt such a procedure.  To leave it to someone else is better.
Chapter Twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients recommended cauterizing a cold fistula with the roots of the wild rue.  Take one of the longest, dried roots of wild rue, as thick as a finger, dip it in oil, and hold it in the fire. Then cauterize once between the collarbone and the neck, and two small cauteries slightly angled towards the underside of the chin, and two larger cauteries above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly angled backwards; another cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach; and three cauteries from behind, one between the shoulder blades and two on the sides of the lower ribs, below the cautery between the shoulder blades.
One should not insert the cautery deeply, but rather apply it superficially to the skin, as a cauterization.  Some ancient authors mention that certain individuals used a heated iron implement resembling a plowshare, heating it and using it to reach the tumor itself, by passing it between the ribs.
The pus will drain, as described with a liver tumor; and in this case of using cauterization for a tumor, there is a risk that the patient will die immediately or that a fistula will develop at the site, without healing.
Chapter Thirty.
In cauterizing the spleen.
If, after treating the spleen with the methods previously described, your treatment proves ineffective, cauterization may be applied in three ways, all of which are correct: one is to cauterize it three or four times in a row along the length of the spleen.
In the shape of the liver cauterizations previously described, with the interval between each cauterization equal to or slightly greater than the thickness of a finger.  Use the same cauterizing instrument as described for liver cauterization.  Do not insert the cauterizing instrument deeply.  The patient should be lying on their back.
The other method is at the elbow.  Lift the skin opposite the spleen, where the patient's left elbow ends, lifting the skin across the width of the body so that the cauterizations fall along the body's length.
Then, insert the cauterizing irons, very carefully, until they pierce the skin on the other side. Then remove the cauterizing irons, resulting in four cauterizations.  If desired, use the three-pronged cauterizing iron instead.
Then treat the cauterized area after allowing it to fester for many days, for this is more effective than any of the previously mentioned treatments.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is helpful only in ascites specifically. If you have treated the dropsy patient with the various treatments that we have described in the divisions, and your treatment has not been effective, then you should cauterize four times around the navel and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen, and two behind the back, one opposite his chest and the other opposite his stomach.  The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then leave the cauterization open to fester for a long time.
Do not neglect the patient's treatment after the cauterization as is appropriate to bring together the two issues so that healing is rapid. The shape of the cauterizing iron used for the back is pointed, as previously described, and that used for the chest is ovoid.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, one should cauterize on the back of the foot at the point between the little finger and the ring finger.
Hold your hand with the cauterizing iron straight, do not bend it, then lift your hand and do not return it; this will draw out the yellow water, and the cauterizing iron should be of this shape.
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg, using the sharp edge of the cauterizing iron.  Cauterize once just below the knee, and another below that, towards the middle of the leg.  Make two cauterizations on each thigh as well.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, so that the water drains out. Then treat it with the rest of the methods we have described.
Chapter Thirty-three.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and dampness, weakening the digestive and binding powers of the stomach and intestines, and other treatments have failed, and you see the patient is strong enough to tolerate a cauterization, cauterize a large area on his stomach. As previously mentioned, cauterize the stomach with a circular cauterizing iron.  Apply four cauterizations around the navel with a fine, pointed cauterizing iron.  Apply one or two large cauterizations to the cotton wool above the coccyx.
If you see a large amount of moisture and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the pubis, each hip, and possibly two small additional cauterizations near the large one on the stomach.  This is a successful and effective treatment, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are numerous chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, or a single one, composed of thick, cold humors or putrid moisture, and treatment as previously described in the classification was ineffective, cauterize the patient with three triangular cauterizations slightly below the lower lumbar vertebrae under the table.
And cauterize below the navel with a distance of two fingers.  If you judge that the stomach is cold, and food is not digesting, and you see swelling in his face, cauterize the stomach with a large cauterization as previously described, and cauterize the liver. And another one on the spleen with a nail-shaped cautery. Leave the cauterization open for a time, and then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery resembling a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart, and press firmly until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as described, then treat them with suitable ointments until healed.  If a large cauterization is performed on a cotton pad, it is even more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula in the perineum and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure we described in its place, and avoids it, perhaps he will be cured by cauterization. If someone has a fistula that has lasted a long time, from which pus and corrupt humors flow, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then ascertain the depth of its penetration with the probe. Then heat the cautery, resembling a needle, and insert it, hot, into the fistula itself, along the line of the fistula's penetration and to the depth the probe reached. Repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt substances are burned, once or twice or three times, according to your needs.
And be careful not to burn a nerve, if one exists, or a large vein, if the fistula opens into the bladder or the intestine.
Be careful of all these areas.  Only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge it to be non-penetrating.  Then treat the area until it heals. If the area seals up, the discharges cease, and it remains so for a time, know that it has been completely healed.
And if the discharges do not cease, know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupt bone in its depth, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On cauterizing the kidney.
If pain in the kidney occurs due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's sexual function is thereby reduced, it is necessary to cauterize over the hips, on the kidney itself, cauterizing each kidney with the nail-headed cautery mentioned previously.  And perhaps we cauterize it three times on the same area, resulting in three consecutive cauterizations, which is more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation of the bladder occur due to cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, cauterize once below the navel on the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and another cauterization to the right of the navel and another to the left.
After cauterization on each side, the size should be equal to the width of the thumb.  Cauterize once at the lower back, or twice if needed. The cautery should be nail-headed, as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If the uterus contains material from cold and dampness, so that conception is prevented, and its structure is impaired, and urination is difficult, or pain occurs during urination, then three cauterizations should be applied around the navel, as mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder. One cauterization on the lumbar region below the back, or two, and the cautery should be nail-headed.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Erroneous humidity may collect on the hip joint, causing dislocation.  A sign is that one leg will be longer than the other when comparing them, and a hollow will be found at the point of dislocation.  Therefore, a roughly circular cauterization should be applied to the affected area on the hip joint itself.
After drawing a circle around the affected area so that the joint itself is in the center of the circle, use the cautery shown in the illustration for stomach cauterizations.  If you do not have this cautery, apply three cauterizations with a large olive cautery.
Make the cauterization as deep as the thickness of the whole skin, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-one.
Cauterization of sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and dampness, and the treatment described in the section was ineffective after some time, the patient should be relieved from thick humours with rotten seeds or prickly pear seeds, or similar substances.
Then cauterize.  Cauterization has two types: either with burning medications or with fire.  Cauterization with fire can be done in many ways, one of which is to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
This creates a beneficial depth. The distance between each cauterization should be equal to the thickness of a finger. The cautery should be olive-shaped. One might also cauterize in the center, on the head of the femur itself, making four cauterizations in total. If desired, you can cauterize with the circular method previously described for hip dislocations, using one cauterization.
So that the circle surrounds the entire hip and burns the thickness of all the skin. This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize two areas on the thigh at the location of the pain indicated by the patient, and one cauterization above the ankle bone about four fingers' width to the lateral side. The cautery should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be just the thickness of the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize the area he points out using a pinpoint cautery three, four, or more times, if necessary. If he points to pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with a single knife-shaped cautery.
Be careful in all your cauterizations, so that you do not burn a major nerve or artery, thereby causing the patient a serious or protracted injury.
I have observed cases of cauterization above the ankle bone where excessive cauterization resulted in gangrene extending to the foot, causing it to completely ulcerate and decay, leading to the entire leg's deterioration, and subsequent diarrhea and death. If the pain is in both areas, cauterize them in the same manner.
Some wise scholars have described a hip cauterization technique using a device resembling a cup made of iron, with a diameter of half a span. Its rim is about the thickness of a date pit, or slightly less.  Inside this cup are another, and a third cup.
The cups are spaced apart by the width of a thumb's knuckle. All the cups are open on both sides and are about one or two knuckles in height.  A handle of iron is attached to the cups, securely fastened. This is the device's form.
Then, it is heated in the fire until it glows red and emits sparks. It is then placed on the hip joint, the patient resting on the right side. Three circular cauterizations are applied in a single session.  He is then left for three days, bandaged with oil, and the wound left open for several days.
Many such procedures follow, then it is treated with ointment until healed. The author of this book stated that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its unpleasantness and horrifying appearance, and few can tolerate it.  However, it is a good cauterization for those who can endure it, and are affected in the area.
As for cauterization with burning medicines, it is done by creating two cups similar to the throat that the rope of the door latch goes into, made of copper or iron.
They will have a height of approximately two knuckles, and will be spaced apart by the thickness of a finger.  The bottoms and tops will be open, and they are fastened together in this manner.
Then, they are placed on the hip joint, the patient lying on his right side.  You should gently hold them.  Then, pour some hot, sharp water between the circles. Hold it for a time, like an hourglass. The patient endures the burning and stinging sensation, as it feels like fire.
Until the burning subsides. Then remove the instrument and wash the entire hip with fresh water.  Then leave it for three days, and apply fat to it until the burn's blackness disappears. Leave it for several days until pus comes out, as this is most beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until healed.  If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold to contain water, similar to what was done for the hip. This is the description of sharp water, and it has been confirmed in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Take one part of caustic soda and one part of quicklime. Grind them and place them in a new pot with a single small hole at the bottom, just large enough for a pestle to enter. Place another glazed pot beneath the bottom of the first pot.
Pour fresh water over the caustic soda and lime, enough to cover them with a finger's breadth, after gently pressing them with your hand. Let the pot sit until the sharp water drains into the glazed pot below. Collect all this water, then pour it onto fresh lime and caustic soda.
Then it will be extremely strong in its sharpness, useful in many medical procedures and for cauterizing other parts of the body, because it acts like fire itself.  Some medications can also cauterize the hip, such as safflower, baladi honey, and lime mixed with soap, all ground up.
Galen claimed, recounting a story about an ancient physician, that a treatment for hip and sciatica pain was extremely effective and that it needed no other treatment, claiming it cured in a single application.
Even to the point where a person might be carried into a bath and walk out cured.  To do this, take fresh green chistroge. If no green is available, take fresh dry chistroge. Grind it with some fat and place it on the hip where the pain is, or on the leg or thigh.
Tie it on and leave it for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning subside. Then, have them enter a bath. When their body is damp, put them in a basin.  The pain will go away and the person will be healed, God willing. If not healed, repeat the dressing after ten days.
He will be healed, God willing.  And know that no one should use these medications for cauterization until the body has been emptied. Dioscorides mentions that goat's dung, when used for cauterizing sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization should be done this way: Take wool, soak it in old oil, and apply it to the deep spot between the thumb and the elbow, closer to the elbow. Then, take dry goat dung.
Set it on fire until it becomes embers, then place it on the wool and let it extinguish. Repeat this process until sensation in the middle of the upper arm extends to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called cauterization with dung.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Back pain may arise from various causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It may be due to the effusion of cold, damp matter.  Cauterization is effective only in this type of case.
After the patient has vomited, a poultice of rotten herbs or the like should be applied.  Cauterize the back where the pain is, in three rows across the table, after marking the area with ink.  In each row, apply five cauterizations, or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength.
Cauterize with a point cautery, or if you wish, with a medium-sized nail cautery, three or four times, in this manner.
Chapter Forty-three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a swelling.
This affliction often affects young children.  A sign of its onset in a child is shortness of breath when standing or moving, and you will find a prominent bead, protruding above the other beads, at the end of the spinal vertebrae.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery, like this. Cauterize each side of the vertebra evenly.  If you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pinpoint cautery in two or three rows, with the points close together.  Then treat the area until it is healed, as described.
Beware of using cauterization on a swelling caused by nerve tension.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are caused by cold dampness affecting any part of the body, when they occur in the legs, physicians usually call it gout specifically.
If the cold gout, its cause, is treated with the methods we have described in the classification, but the pain does not subside, then cauterization will relieve it.  Cauterize the area around the joints of the legs with many cauteries, using a medium olive-oil cautery in this manner.
And if it is necessary to cauterize on the surface of the leg, do so with a point cautery. If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, as often happens, cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries on each side using the same olive-oil cautery.
If more cauterization is required, cauterize, but do not make the cauterization too deep, only to the thickness of the skin. If the pain ascends to the hips or back, use the cauterization described in its section.
If the pain is only in the hands, cauterize around the elbows, as if tracing two lines. If the pain persists in the fingers, cauterize each joint and the palm of the hand. If the pain ascends to the forearms or shoulders after a few days,
Cauterize both (forearms/shoulders) from every side.  The patient should not neglect good treatment and taking medications.  If the diet is improved and phlegm is expelled, then recovery will occur with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the cauterization of hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some intestines and bowels have descended into the testicle, and this has happened recently, then the patient should be instructed to abstain from food that day and use laxatives to evacuate the bowels.
Then, the patient should lie on their back before you, and you should instruct them to hold themselves still until the bowels or intestines protrude.  Then, you should push them back with your finger.  Then, mark the area under the hernia on the pubic bone with ink, making a mark resembling a semicircle, its ends extending towards the upper body.
Then, heat a cautery iron—this is its description.
Until it becomes white, throwing sparks. Then, return the intestines or bowels to their place.  Then, a servant should place their hand over the area to prevent the intestines from protruding.  The legs of the patient have been separated and a cushion placed underneath.  Another servant holds the legs together.
And another servant is on the patient's chest, holding their hands. Then, the cautery iron is placed over the same mark. Your hand, holding the cautery iron, should remain straight and firm until it reaches the bone, or repeat the process if it does not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And exert yourself to prevent the intestines from protruding while cauterizing, so as not to burn them, thereby causing the patient either death or a great illness.  Know that if the cauterization does not reach the bone, your work will not succeed.  The cautery iron should be gentle for children according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then, treat the cauterized area with ghee after three days, until the scorching of the fire is gone.  Then treat it with other ointments until healed.  Let the patient lie on their back for forty days until the wound is closed.
His food during his treatment should be such as to soften his bowels, so that the intestines do not protrude during defecation.  Then, if he wishes to stand up after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.  Reduce the strain of eating, drinking, and loud noises.
If he follows this treatment, he will recover completely, God willing.  I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its proper place, God willing.  As for a hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is in its early stages, if you want to prevent it from worsening, cauterize a circular area corresponding to its size. Let the burned skin be about one-third of its thickness.  Then treat it as we have mentioned, for it will not worsen, God willing. Some of the earlier scholars have mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery iron in this manner.
After drawing lines with ink, the line across the upper side of the hernia and the other line down to the bottom, then place a single, nail-like cautery in the middle. The first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If, in any limb, a fall or blow causes pain that persists for a long time and is not relieved by medication, it is necessary to cauterize with a point cautery, and the cauterization of each limb should be according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And if the pain and fistula are overcome by it, then he will recover from the first cautery, otherwise repeat the cauterization, because it is customary for these pains to spread from the limb to those nearby; therefore, it is necessary to follow up with cauterization until the patient recovers.
Chapter Forty-seven.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
As for those afflicted with leprosy, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that originates from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize him, observe. If the leprosy is in its initial stages, and you have treated it as described in the classification, and it has not deteriorated or stopped, and you fear that the corruption will spread to all the patient's humours, cauterize the head five times. One in the usual center of the head, the second below it towards the forehead, at the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one from behind at the nape of the neck.  Apply the cauterization slightly deeper so it affects the bone to a minor degree.
And scales will peel off, making it easier for the thick vapors to escape.  Also cauterize the spleen as mentioned previously.  However, if the leprosy has persisted and is clearly evident on the patient, you should cauterize with the aforementioned methods on the head. One cauterization on the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the spine, and another above it in the same area, and two on each thigh, one on each hip. Two on each knee, one on each knee, two on each shoulder, two on each elbow, two on the ribs of the chest, and cauterize each joint of his fingers and toes, and each heel of his feet and wrist of his hands.
And be careful not to burn the nerve behind the heels, and a cauterization might be applied to the pubic bone, another to the stomach opening, and another to the liver. Know that the more cauterizations are made, the more beneficial and effective it will be.
Know that the patient feels less pain from the cauterization than a healthy person because their body is numb. The size of the cauterizing instrument should vary according to the specific part of the body and the joint, as detailed in the descriptions of the instruments.
Then treat the cauterization with fine crushed dates, honey, and other remedies, until he recovers, God willing.
The Forty-eighth Chapter.
Concerning cauterization for numbness: If a body part is numb and treated with medications, ointments, and dressings, but does not heal, cauterize the same numb part with cauterizations appropriate to the size of the affected body part; make your cauterizations slightly below the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals.  Cauterization can be used for some numbness that affects the hand or foot in the spinal column, at the exit point of the nerve that moves that limb, to eliminate the numbness.
Only those who are knowledgeable about the dissection of body parts and the exit points of the nerves that move the body should attempt this.
The Forty-ninth Chapter.
On cauterizing leprosy.
If leprosy persists and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it with a small amount of depth, proportionate to the thickness of the skin, so that the whiteness disappears and the color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil,  horsetail herb, and pigeon blood or hawk blood, one part of each. Mix all of them, apply it to a cloth, and bandage the area until healed.
The Fiftieth Chapter.
On cauterizing cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, moving as it revolves. Some physicians have mentioned using a severe cauterization in the center, but I do not consider this, as I anticipate ulceration, and I have seen this happen on several occasions.
So the correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we have said, or with many small cauterizations.
The Fifty-first Chapter.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If a fistula has occurred and is slow to mature, either due to the causative agent, or due to the patient's age (if they are old and anemic), or due to time, and you wish to accelerate the fistula's maturation, cauterize around it with many small, punctuate cauterizations.
Then leave it, for this will hasten maturation.  If you wish to cover it with cauterization, heat the cautery iron that has this form.
Place it in the center of the fistula, until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be below, so the discharge of pus is easier.  Then treat it with what is appropriate until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-two.
On cauterizing ulcers.
Ulcers are nothing but corruption that ravages a part of the body and consumes it, as fire consumes dry wood.  If you see an ulcer in a place suitable for cauterization by fire, heat a cautery iron with many small and large nails, according to what is appropriate for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from every side until all corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains. Then leave it for three days and apply crushed sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scab and corruption is removed.
Then treat it with healing ointments. If after three days you see that the flesh is growing soundly without corruption, then stop.  Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on any remaining corrupted areas.  Ulcers may also be treated with a sharp medicine.
It acts as a substitute for fire, providing faster relief.  The treatment of ulcers with sharp medicine is mentioned in the divisions; consult there for details when needed.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On the cauterization of inverted and non-inverted nails.
This affliction, a rough and painful condition, often occurs on the soles of the feet.  Cauterization for it can be performed in two ways: either with fire or with a sharp liquid.
As for cauterization with fire, heat a hollowed-out cautery iron, resembling an eagle's beak, made of iron and fitting snugly around the nail on all sides, with a thin rim.  Then apply it hot to the nail, and rotate your hand around the nail, until the cautery reaches the nail's depth.
Leave it for three days, allowing pus to form, then bandage it with pounded wild chamomile mixed with salt.  Leave the bandage on for a night, and the nail will detach from its roots.  Then treat the wound with a flesh-inducing ointment until healed, if the nails are not inverted.
This affliction often occurs on the surface of the body, particularly the hands and feet.  A tube of copper, iron, or eagle's beak should be applied to the nail or wart.  Then, a small amount of sharp liquid should be poured into the tube.
Hold the tube in your hand, rotating it gently, so the tube's rim affects the nail's root, allowing the sharp liquid to penetrate to the nail's root. The patient should endure the sharp liquid's sting for a short while.
Then leave it, for the nail will detach from its roots.  Do this one by one, until all those on the body are removed.  Then treat the areas where they were with flesh-inducing ointments.
Chapter Forty-five.
Concerning the removal of scabs.
If a scab forms from cold in the nerve, or from a fever of the quarter, or something else, it is necessary to cauterize it four or five times on the spine, placing a cauterization between each bead, and one on the chest. And cauterize the abdomen with the olive oil cautery, for the scab will subside and hasten the maturation of the cold illness.
Chapter Fifty-five.
Concerning the cauterization of wounds occurring on the body.
Ugly boils may arise in the body from thick, corrupt, cold materials.  Upon their first appearance, a gentle cauterization should be applied to the head of each boil with a stick whose tip has been heated in fire, or with the root of a long zera'und, or with a lens-shaped cautery.
And boils, in their initial eruption, may be cauterized in this manner.  The causative factor will not increase, but will dissipate, and the patient will recover, provided that this occurs after the patient has been bled.
Chapter Fifty-six.
Concerning the cauterization of bleeding occurring from severed arteries.
Bleeding frequently occurs from a severed artery in a wound from the outside, or in the incision of a tumor, or cauterization of a part of the body, and similar cases, and it is difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly apply your index finger to the mouth of the artery, pressing gently until the blood is contained beneath your finger and nothing escapes. Then, take several small and large olive-shaped cauteries and heat them in the fire until extremely hot.
Then, take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery has ruptured, and apply the cautery to the same vein, after quickly removing your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If the bleeding starts again when you remove your finger from the artery's opening and the cautery cools, quickly take another cautery from the heated ones and continue doing this, one after another, until the bleeding stops.
Take care not to burn a nerve, lest another affliction result for the patient.  Know that if an artery is bleeding, it cannot be severed, especially if it is large, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by amputation if it is not already severed. If it is severed, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop; or it may be tied with strong threads, or the appropriate drugs to stop the bleeding and tighten the ligatures may be applied.
However, attempting to sever it with a ligature, or tightening with cloth, or applying burning substances, or the like, will not stop it at all, except rarely. If such a thing occurs and no physician or remedy is present, then he should immediately place the index finger over the opening of the wound itself, as we have described.
He should press it firmly until the blood is constricted and flows from above the wound and onto the artery and the finger.  The finger should be continuously kept on it with extremely cold water, until the blood solidifies and thickens, and stops flowing.  During this time, observe what cauterization or medication may be needed.
Chapter Two.
Concerning incisions, lancinations, phlebotomy, and similar surgical procedures.
Khalaf said: We have previously discussed in the first chapter all diseases suitable for cauterization with fire and corrosive remedies, their causes and reasons, and the instruments used.  We have divided that into sections, from the foot to the head.
And I will follow the same approach in this chapter, so that the student can easily attain their goal.
Before beginning this, you children should know that this chapter contains greater uncertainties than the first chapter on cauterization.
For this reason, caution must be greater here, because in this chapter, the practitioner often risks expelling the blood upon which life depends when opening a vein or making an incision on a tumor or an abscess, or treating a wound or removing an arrow or cutting a stone, and similar procedures.  All of these are accompanied by uncertainty and fear, and death often occurs in most of them.
I urge you to avoid any uncertainty in your work.  Many people with various illnesses come to you in this profession.  Some may be weary of their illness and see death as a relief.
Due to the severity of their illness and the prolonged suffering, some show signs of death.  Some give you their wealth to bring about health, and their illness is fatal, so you must not assist anyone who has this sort of condition at all.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness.  Do not undertake any of these procedures without certain knowledge that you have the best possible outcome.  In all of your treatment of your patients, use the knowledge of the situation to anticipate how the cure might go.
For in this you will gain praise, glory, remembrance, and thanks. May God inspire you, my children, with good judgment and preserve your correctness and success.  For that is in His hand, there is no god but He.
I have arranged this chapter into sections, following the previous chapter on cauterization, from the head to the foot, so that you will find what you are looking for more easily, God willing.
Chapter One.
On treating the water that collects in the heads of children.
This ailment often occurs in infants at birth if the midwife applies pressure to the infant's head without gentleness.  It may also arise from a hidden, unknown cause.
I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than infants.  All those I have seen who had it died quickly.  Therefore, I have seen fit to abandon treatment for it.  I once saw an infant whose head had filled with water and whose head was growing larger every day. Until the infant could no longer sit up due to the enlargement of his head and the increasing moisture, and thus perished.
This moisture may gather between the skin and bone, or beneath the bone upon the peritoneum.  If the moisture is between the skin and bone and the swelling is small, a single horizontal incision should be made in the center of the head, about two spans long, to allow the moisture to drain. This is a depiction of the lancet.
If the moisture is more extensive and the swelling larger, make two intersecting incisions in this manner.
If the moisture is beneath the bone, indicated by the sutures of the head opening on all sides and the water receding inward when pressed with your hand, this is clear.  Then, three incisions should be made in the center of the head in this manner.
After the incision, all the moisture will drain out. Then, the incisions should be bound with strips and bandages.  Then, apply poultices of herbs and oil for five days.  Then, loosen the bandages and treat the wound with ointments and plasters.  Maintain a moderate head dressing.  Feed the patient with all dry foods that are low in moisture.
Until the organ strengthens and heals.  Another approach to incision is to look for where the bone of the swelling and the collection of water are evident, as it may be more prominent at the back of the head, or the front, or the right, or the left.
So aim the incision where the swelling and accumulation of water appear, making an incision as you can, being careful not to sever an artery, causing bleeding that could kill the patient from the bleeding, while draining the moisture.
The Second Chapter.
Severing the two arteries behind the ears, known as the "hissans.
When someone suffers from a severe affliction of the eyes or chest, which persists and is not relieved by medication, the best treatment in such cases is severing these two arteries.
Therefore, if you wish to sever them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the artery.  Then, pull the patient's neck taut with the aid of his clothes, then look for where the pulse is and their two locations, the two lower locations behind the ears.  They are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then sever them with a dissecting scalpel, cutting to the bone.  This should be done with the head in a straight position.  If you prefer, you may insert the scalpel under the artery and cut upwards.  The length of the cut should be about two clenched fingers.
If the artery is severed, the blood will flow out in a pulsating manner, surging forward and in a continuous stream. If the artery is not visible, you should estimate the location from the ear, about three fingers' breadth away, then mark it with ink and cut to the bone.  And what is essential...
Approximately six ounces of blood will be released immediately.  It may be more or less, all depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries.  Then, examine the wound; if any part of the peritoneum remains on the bone, sever it.
So that a hot swelling does not appear, then bandage the wound with a linen thread, and treat it with ointments until healed.
Chapter Three.
The arteries in the temples.
If a person experiences chronic headaches or acute attacks caused by sharp humidity and heat in the muscles of the temples, or chronic, severe headaches, and similar conditions, and if treatment by various medical methods is ineffective, we have tried, in these illnesses, to dissect the arteries of the temples or cauterize them, as we have described.
The procedure for dissecting them is that the patient should shave the hair from the temples, and locate the visible artery in the temple, for its pulsation will make it clear.  It is rarely hidden, except perhaps in some individuals.
Or, if it is difficult to find in severe cold, the patient should tighten his neck with his clothing, then you should rub the area with a cloth, or apply warm water until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the lancet, which has this form. Then, gently slice through the skin with the lancet until you reach the artery, then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards until you bring it out through the skin, and release it from the membranes underneath on all sides.  If the artery is thin, twist it with the end of the hook. Then cut a piece from it, of a size such that its ends are separated and contracted, and no bleeding occurs.  If it is not severed and not cut, the blood will not recede at all.  Then, drain from six to three ounces of blood.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong doubled thread, whether of silk or bowstrings, so that gangrene does not quickly affect it before the wound heals, thus causing bleeding.
Then, cut away the excess between the ligatures.  Do this at that time or after some other time.  If you wish, cauterize it to the bone with a knife cauterizer until its ends are severed, in which case this action will accomplish the same purpose, or even better, as we said.
However, if the patient has a fever or a heated temperament, cauterization is even more beneficial because it helps to eliminate moisture.  After ligating the arteries, the area should be packed with used cotton and covered with firm dressings.  Following the removal of the dressings, treat with dry medications that promote flesh regeneration and with compresses until it heals, God willing.
If, during your work, bleeding occurs from the artery, promptly cut it, either with cautery or by filling the area with pitch and applying pressure with your hand until the bleeding stops.  If you do not have any of these things available, then apply your finger until the blood clots.
Apply very cold water to the area until the throbbing subsides and it is properly constricted.  Something easier and less involved than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the locations with ink.
Apply it very intensely until it reaches the bone and severs the vein in two places, so that the ends are spaced apart.  This cautery will not cause them to adhere.  This is a picture of the cautery.
The blades are sharp, resembling small daggers, but much less sharp than a knife.  If they were as sharp as a knife, the cold would reach them quickly, and the flesh would not separate quickly.  If there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire will remain in them.
And it quickly cuts the flesh. This method is better than all others, easier and simpler.  Allow the space between the blades to be about the thickness of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
On treating constant hot watering of the eyes.
If the tears are constant and flow from the veins on the skull's exterior, and if no medicinal treatment helps, and you see the patient's face has reddened... And he feels a crawling sensation in his forehead, like ants crawling, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their edges worn away and their eyelids glued together due to the severity of the tears.  Early practitioners, in their treatment, resorted to this method. They call it the treatment with the sword, which is to command the patient to shave the hair on his forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made on the forehead, their length about two fingers each, parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second one slightly off the action of the muscle in the temple, and the third on the opposite side.
And beware of cutting the arteries on either side. Keep your hand away from the jaw joint.  After each incision, leave a space of three fingers' breadth. Have prepared sponges or many dry cloths to absorb the blood.
Then, insert the sharp double-ended scalpel, which has this form. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, use it to remove all the skin and periosteum between the incisions. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, and then remove the scalpel. Then, insert into the first incision another tool, called a single-sided, sharp scalpel, smooth and blunt on the other side, which has this form.
Place the sharp side of the tool upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin, and the blunt side towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle incision, cutting all the vessels descending from the head to the eyes, without cutting through the skin.
Then do the same from the middle incision to the other incision.  After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, press the areas of coagulated blood. Then, place a cotton wick in each incision and apply a compress soaked in a mixture of broth, oil, or vinegar and oil.
To prevent a hot swelling. On the third day, the ligaments are released.  Use copious warm water compresses. Then, treat it with basil ointment, rose oil, and other treatments for wounds until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On treating tears and discharge from the eyes from within the head.
When someone experiences frequent, intense, persistent discharges, and the eyes appear small and weak, with diminished vision, and the eyelids ulcerated and eyelashes falling out. And there is intense, painful pain deep within the head, and repeated sneezing.  Know from these symptoms that these fluids and discharges arise from numerous deep veins.  The best treatment is this: instruct the afflicted to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the center of the forehead.
And there is intense, painful pain deep within the head, and repeated sneezing.  Know from these symptoms that these fluids and discharges arise from numerous deep veins.  The best treatment is this: instruct the afflicted to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the center of the forehead. Or, raise it slightly transversely and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple.  The incision should be into the bone. Keep your hand away from the moving temporal muscles during chewing. Once the bone is exposed and all the blood is dried with a sponge...
Then separate the edges of the incision with worn cotton or flax fibers.  Tie it shut with bandages soaked in medicine and oil, to prevent a hot swelling.  Once you have resolved it, and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with the desiccated preparation that grows flesh, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of calophon and preparing a poultice from them.  Use it for the growth of flesh in wounds like these.
Chapter Six.
For treating what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic or semi-metallic stone, like iron or glass; or a plant seed, such as chickpeas, kernels, and the like; or a liquid, like water and vinegar, and the like.
Or an animal. If a stone or a stone-like object has fallen into the ear and it does not extend into the ear canal, then expose the ear to the sun. If you see the stone, apply some violet or suruj ointment to it, and then try to remove it by moving the head or inducing sneezing with a cupping device. Close the nostrils when sneezing occurs, after having placed a bandage of cloth or wool around the ear and tilting the ear upwards.  Often the object comes out with this treatment. If it does not, then try to remove it with a gentle swab, whose form is like this.
If it comes out with the swab, otherwise try to remove it with a flexible, slightly curved, blunt needle. If it does not come out with that, then make a copper tube and insert the tube end into the ear canal.
Seal the area around the tube with softened pitch, oiled, so that air has no way to escape except through the tube.  Then pull it out with a strong pull.  Often, it comes out with this.  If it does not come out with what we have described, then take a small amount of mastic or the mastic that is used to catch birds, and place it on the end of the ear speculum.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, then gently insert it into the ear canal after the ear has dried from moisture. If it does not come out with all the methods described, then proceed to incision before the inflammatory swelling or stiffness occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient at the temples to a degree proportional to their strength.  Then, place the patient before you, tilting their ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear, near the cartilage, in the lowest part.
The incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone. Then remove it with any available instruments.  Immediately suture the incision and treat it until it heals.
If the object that fell into the ear is one of the seeds that swell and become inflamed, attempt to remove it using the methods mentioned. If it does not come out, then take a slender, gentle forceps, shaped like this.
Attempt to break those types of fallen seeds in the ear using this.  However, only do this if you are certain that the seed has become moistened by the ear’s vapor, so that it can be broken into many small pieces. Then remove them with a blind probe, a gentle swab, or suction.
As we have mentioned, it will be easier to remove it.  Regarding water in the ear, the patient should first use a bellows to induce sneezing.  They should also fill their ear with some used cotton, lying on the ear containing water. If this expels it.
Otherwise, take several smooth, thin stones, warm them slightly by fire. The patient should insert one into the ear canal.  The patient should stand on one leg, on the affected side, and strike another stone against the stone in the ear.
He should continue doing this with stone after stone until all the water is removed.  Water may also be expelled by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and heating the other end by fire until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.
Repeat this several times until all water is expelled, or pull it out with a tube as previously mentioned regarding the stones.  Regarding removing an animal inside, if it is small like a flea or similar, treat it as described in the classification.  Otherwise...
If its body is large enough to be felt, try removing it with lint and forceps.  This is easier than anything else that can be lodged in the ear. Regarding removing worms that have developed in the ear, if you have treated it as described in the classification in the article on ear-insects and your treatment does not work.
You should look into the ear in the sunlight. If you see anything of the worm, remove it with lint or fine forceps. If you see nothing, take a tube, this is its form.
Narrow at the bottom, wide at the top. Insert the narrow end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it, repeating this several times until all the worm comes out. If it does not come out, seal around the tube with wax, as I mentioned to you regarding the stone.
If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, use the ear-insects which I have described. The ancients have tested them for killing worms; you will find this in the chapter on ear-insects. You will use this instrument to apply ointments and medications to the ear.  This is its form.
As you see, you make it from silver or brass, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top. If you wish, the tube within the instrument can be made of tightly fitted brass, or if you wish, you take a spindle and tightly wrap cotton around one end.
Then you place the ointment, or juice, or whatever medicine you want, in the tube while it is in the ear.  Then you insert the spindle with the cotton from above and press gently with your hand until the ointment is driven into the ear cavity and felt.
Administer it to the patient internally.  Let whatever you pour into the ear be slightly warmed in the fire.  Be careful that the substance you instill is neither too cold nor too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of ear obstructions.
Some children may emerge from their mothers' wombs with their ear canals unpierced.
Some people may also experience an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or a growth of flesh within it.  This obstruction may be deep within the ear canal, and thus not apparent to the eye.
Sometimes it presents slightly outside the canal and is visible.  An obstruction deep within the ear, unseen, is usually more difficult to cure.  If it is visible, the patient's ear should be placed in the sun. And examine it.  If you see the obstruction externally, open it with a gentle scalpel, which should appear like this:
Its tip should have a slight, limited projection on one side, while the rest of the scalpel should have smooth sides to avoid injuring the ear.  If the obstruction is from flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a gentle forceps and cut it with great delicacy until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep in the ear, take a smooth, gentle probe, warm it slightly in the fire, and then insert it into the ear canal.  If you feel the obstruction, along with the patient's experience of difficulty in hearing, gently remove it.
Be careful not to injure the eardrum. Then, insert a wick into the ear, sized according to the canal's width, coated in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days, to ensure the wound does not heal prematurely.  Alternatively, take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle powdered za'farân on it.
Use it. If you see the ear has become swollen and inflamed, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick coated in qīrūṭī, made with rose oil, to relieve the inflammation. Then continue treatment until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear. Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding as described in the section on cauterization.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  They should be grasped with a forceps or hook and cut from their roots with a scalpel. Then, powdered zāg should be applied to the area.
If blood flows from them, cauterize it with a gentle lentil-shaped cauterizing iron.  Cauterization after cutting is better.  It often returns if anything remains of its roots.  If cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and it will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of colds affecting the eyelids.
A condition resembling a cold in its severity and hardness often appears on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called a cold, being a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.  If the cold is prominent on the surface of the eyelid, moving in all directions, then it is easy to treat.  Make a transverse incision on it.
Then gently peel it from all sides until it detaches. Then suspend it with a hook and cut it. If you cannot cut it without penetrating the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, stitch it and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, there is no problem. The ointment will mend and seal it. If the cold is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, turn the eyelid inside out and suspend the cold with a hook without needing an incision, and trim it from all sides.
If the eyelid is penetrated by the cut, that will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the cold with saline water and treat the area with something that will heal until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
On treating the hordeolum that appears in the eyelid.
The hordeolum is a swelling that occurs in the layers of the upper eyelid.  It most often appears in boys. It burdens their eyes, causing them colds in the pre-dawn hours and they cannot look at the sunlight. Because tears hasten to them.
Therefore, you see them constantly leaning on their faces, and sleeping on them, their eyelids under their eyebrows damp, perhaps swollen.  The hordeolum, the swelling, is clearly visible.  And if you press the area with your fingers, you feel the hordeolum between them.  The procedure is for the patient to place their head on your lap.
Then take a linen rag, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick large enough to encircle the hordeolum on all sides.  Then place it over the hordeolum and press with your fingers on all sides to gather the hordeolum in the center of the circle.
Then, with a lancet, make a horizontal incision in the middle of that dampness, an incision no larger than that made in phlebotomy.  As for the depth, you must cut through all the skin until you reach the hordeolum.
In most cases, the hordeolum protrudes from the incision as a white piece of fat.  Grab it with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, pulling it outward as you rotate your hand right and left until it heals.  Be careful not to enlarge the incision, lest the lancet injure the eye.
If the hordeolum does not appear at the initial incision, gently enlarge the incision a little until the hordeolum protrudes. Then, pull it out as we said.  Next, soak a cloth in vinegar and water and place it over the area, securing it with a bandage. Some people also crush salt.
Place it [the crushed salt] in the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture. Then treat it until it heals. If a hot abscess develops at the site, treat it with cooling compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of eye dressings.
If extra eyelashes grow on the eyelid, outside the natural course beneath the natural eyelashes and become thickened, they harm the eye and cause various ailments, such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, whitening, and thickening, even leading to the eye's impairment.
Eye dressings are of four types: either by cauterization with fire, or by a strong medicine as previously discussed in the chapter on cauterization; or the dressing may be by cutting and stitching, or by applying a reed, as I shall describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand.  If it turns, then take a needle with thread from below the eyelid and pierce the needle with the thread from above, near the hair itself.  Pull the thread upward with the eyelid.
Then turn it with a spatula, and make a slit in the inner eyelid, without cutting the extra hair, using a forceps from the greater hook to the smaller hook. Then remove the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth beneath the eyelid and bandage the eyelid with a compress.
It should be like the shape of a rue leaf, but the shape should be as great as necessary to raise the eyelid, because it varies among individuals. Some may require a certain amount of the eyelid to be cut, depending on the degree of eyelid relaxation.
Some require a smaller cut, all according to the degree of eyelid relaxation.  Then, slit along the two lines that you marked, starting from the greater hook to the smaller hook. Each slit should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a spatula.
Then, insert the hook into one of the corners of the skin, and peel it all away.  Then, stitch the edges together with a needle and thin wool thread, wipe away the blood, and secure any remaining threads to the eyebrows with adhesive materials.
You may wish to do this, or not, as you see fit.  The stitches and threads should remain for about three or four days, then treat it. If you prefer, leave the wound un-stitched and treat it with something that dries and contracts, because the eyelid will rise when the wound is sealed and closed.  Stitching is preferable.
This method of lifting the eyelid, mentioned by the ancients, though it may be troublesome for the patient, is a good practice and without danger.  Another method for lifting the eyelid is to form the eyelid into a shape like a rue leaf, as described. Then lift the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or grouped in this manner:
Then cut the excess eyelid with a small pair of scissors, in this manner, making even cuts.
If you cannot hold the hooks in place or if they are uneven, take a needle with thread, insert it into the center of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger opening, and a third near the smaller. Hold the threads between your fingers evenly, then lift your hand in a controlled manner.
Lift the marked skin completely, as described, then suture the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals.  If a hot swelling arises from your cutting or incision, soothe it with a poultice or similar soothing ointment.
The lower eyelid may also have its edges turn inward.  In this case, the cutting, stitching, cauterization with fire and with a sharp medicine, and cauterization with fire or with a sharp medicine is more effective and less harsh on the patient than cutting and stitching.  In either case, use the more appropriate method.
Cauterization with a reed is done in this way: turn the eyelid over and make an incision on the inside, as described, then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to the eyelid's length and their width narrower than a scalpel's width.
Shape them by nibbling at their ends on both sides where the threads adhere, then gently bring them together over the remaining part of the eyelid and tightly tie the reeds on both sides. Leave it for several days; the tightened skin will die, turn black, and decay.
Until it falls off on its own.  If it is slow to fall off, nibble it with nippers and then treat it until healed.  When it heals, the eyelid will rise and the edges will not irritate the eye.  This is the shape and size of the reeds, in length and width:
Chapter Twelve.
For removing irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
If it is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle, thread it with a smooth, fine silk thread, tie the ends in a very gentle knot, and make the thread about a span long.
Then thread another fine, shorter thread onto the needle, and knot its ends if desired.  The patient should place their head on your lap, close to the sun so the work is clear, as it is delicate work. Then, using the needle and thread, go into the root of the extra hair.
And carefully remove it through the eyelid, bringing it out above the natural hair.  Then pull the thread upward, out of the needle, and remove the hair(s) - one, two, or three at most - from the needle.
Then gently pull the needle until the hair comes out of the eyelid with the natural hair. If pulling the needle doesn't remove the hair, pull the needle downwards with the thread you've threaded through it, until the needle comes out the top hole.
Then return the hair to the needle, and pull both of them out, repeating until the hair is elevated in the upper hole and visible.  Then, remove the needle and thread, close and bandage the eye. Leave the eye bandaged for two or three days until the hair is securely in place, and the flesh has grown around it.
If the hair is short, either attach a long strand of natural hair to it so it lifts up, or leave it until it grows longer, then lift it up.
Chapter Thirteen.
On treating the sty that occurs on the upper eyelid.
This sty, called "arniya," can be either natural or accidental.  Accidental styes result from an abscess, wound, laceration, or similar burn.
The procedure is to incise the abscess, separate its edges, and insert a linen thread between them, tying it off until it heals.  Avoid using things that dry and constrict.
If you do this, the sty will return worse.  Instead, use softening things like fenugreek, moistened with steeped cumin, linseed, and diachylon ointment mixed with some oil. Apply this to the thread and treat it with this.
The key to its treatment is to prevent it from adhering in its original form by every possible means.  The method described is a partial remedy for the sty, not a restoration of the original condition.
Chapter Fourteen.
On treating styes in the lower eyelid.
This sty, which arises from below, is truly a sty, and is either natural or accidental.  The accidental styes result from a wound, cut, burn, or the like.
The procedure involves taking a needle with a doubled thread, inserting it into the flesh, piercing from the inner to outer canthus until the thread is on both sides of the flesh.  Then, the flesh is pulled upwards with the needle and cut with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good. Otherwise, take a pledget and place it over the cut. Turn the eyelid over, making two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, with the ends of the incisions extending from the angles of the cut so they meet to form an angle. So that when they meet, the shape becomes similar to this shape.
Then, remove the flesh, as much as the sharp side of it is below the eyelid.  Then, gather the separated pieces with two stitches, sewing them with a wool thread.  Then, treat it with the relaxing and drawing medications we mentioned, until it heals.
If the ulcer has appeared from a cut, stitching, or cauterization, a small incision should be made, excluding the eyelashes, as described before. Then separate the lips with a drawing tool, as previously mentioned.
In summary, for treating ulcers whether located above or below, conduct the treatment according to the appearance of the ulcer.  It may vary considerably in form.  The skilled craftsman devises the appropriate method.
So that the shape returns to or approximates its natural form. The disease itself indicates the suitable treatment and tools, in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion can affect many people, causing the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, hindering its movement and natural functions.  A slender probe should be inserted under the eyelid.
Lift it upwards or pull it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not as sharp as other scalpels, but rather somewhat blunt, so as not to disturb the patient while working, lest the scalpel slips and injures the eye with its sharpness. Your cut should be as if you were peeling off the adhesion.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural position and the entire adhesion heals.  Then, irrigate the eye with salt water or instill a solution of zinjari (a type of herbal extract) in water from a dropper. Then, separate the eyelid and the eye with a linen thread.
Place moistened egg white on top of the eye. After three days, use the softened poultices until healed.
Chapter Sixteen.
In cutting the nail and deep flesh growths.
The nail is of two types: either nervous, resembling a tough, thin membrane, or non-nervous, resembling a stiff, white moisture that breaks if touched with an iron tool or if one tries to grasp it with tongs.
And a tongs will not grip it. Both types, starting from the largest part, gradually spread until they cover the eye and obstruct the light and movement of the eye.  The method for cutting it is for the patient to place his head in the rock.
Then, he opens his eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand. Then, grasp the nail with a slightly curved tongs and pull it upwards.  Then take a needle, thread a horse or cow hair and a strong thread through it, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and pierce the middle of the nail.
Pierce it with the needle and tie the nail with the thread. Pull it upwards and scrape off the side of the nail next to the pupil with the hair, as if spreading it with the hair to its end. Then, cut the remaining part at the root of the growth with a gentle scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the growth.
So that a constant flow of tears does not result from cutting it. The nail can be pulled with the tongs alone, or with the thread, as we said, then the smooth side, which is depicted in this way, is scraped off with a scalpel.
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, causing a rupture and thus damaging the pupil.  Then, after cutting, apply some powdered salt or zinjari shayaf to the eye, and leave it for another day.  Then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle or secure it with tongs, this type of nail is often treated with medicines, and heals as described in the section. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, blunt scalpel, like this picture. And gently scrape the nail from above, if you see it becoming loose and fragmented and only the scraping has been done, then instill from your watch into the eye either zinjari shayaf, or red shayaf, or powdered salt and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until all of it is gone, except if a hot tumor interferes with the eye, then leave it be and treat the hot tumor until it heals, then resume the scraping procedure until it heals. And as for the protruding flesh...
If the protruding flesh causes severe pain to the eye, then suspend that protrusion with the tongs and cut off a portion, but do not overdo the cutting lest it cause excessive tearing. Then instill into the depths red or zinjari shayaf until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting the wording and any excess flesh that grows in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red, layered flesh may grow until it covers the pupil or nearly does, or spills onto the eyelids, and perhaps the eyelids turn outward, resembling a rose.
The procedure is that the patient should place his head in your lap, then open his eyes, and you should remove all of that red flesh with the appropriate forceps.
Or hold it with a scalpel or a dressing, then cut the flesh, piece by piece, until all of it is gone, protecting the eye from being harmed during the procedure.  Your cut can be made either with the scalpel we described in the section on cutting the toenail, or with small scissors. Like the way you pick thorns, as will be shown in the next chapter.
Once the cutting is complete and all the flesh is gone, fill the eye with powdered salt or apply drops of red or similar corrosive medications, and apply a bandage of egg white to the outside of the eye to prevent a hot swelling.
If any flesh remains and bleeding occurs, and you fear a hot swelling, leave the eye and treat it to relieve the swelling, then return to the procedure until healed.  Do the same with any excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye through nature or by presenting it to the procedure with the iron.  Do not put your hand in anything of these procedures until you see that the organ is suitable for this procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the extraction of objects from the eye.
The objects are red veins that intertwine on the eye, preventing sight and weakening the eye over time.  Therefore, you should first look; if the eye containing the objects is strong and has no other ailment besides the objects.
Then, the extraction is to instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and then to suspend those veins with a single or double hook, depending on your skill.  The hooks should be delicately bent in this manner:
or be double hooks in a single body, in this manner:
Then, gently extract those veins with a fine scissors, and wipe away the blood occasionally until you see the eye is free of those veins and the blood has drained.  Protect the eye, avoid injuring it with the tips of the scissors.  Let your work be during the middle of the day, in the light of the sun.
Be very diligent in your work so as not to cut anything other than those veins.  When you are finished, instill into the eye green or red stibium to consume any remaining objects.  If you cannot extract all of them at that time, then bandage the eye to relieve its pain.
Leave it for several days until the pain subsides and any inflammation is gone. Then, repeat the procedure in the exact same manner until the eye is healed. This is the manner of scissors to remove the pain from the eye.
Leave it, [and the head of the patient should be in the student's lap, and another should dry the tears and examine the front and back of the eye.  And you] -- the original method for doing this is to open the eye with fixed or triangular openers held by a student.
Keep a watchful eye, and the patient's head should be in the student's lap, and another should dry the tears and examine the front and back of the eye.  You have the option of starting the extraction from the top or bottom of the eye.  It is best to dry two hooks on the upper side, one at the end of the eyebrow and the other at the beginning.
Hold it between the middle and index finger, then attach hooks underneath opposite them.  Then hold it between the ring and pinky fingers, and gently remove your hand so that you see all the objects have risen. Cut them from the smaller part, if you wish, with scissors or a gentle scalpel.
Insert the hook on a needle and pull all the strands until they rise above the membrane.  Do not cut the strands, for tears and blood will mix with you.
Then cut with scissors any excess above and below the eyebrow so that only the cornea remains exposed. If you can raise it from the cornea, peel it with the hook; this is better and may be feasible in some cases.
If you cut it, the area will be irritated for a few days, alleviating pain and inflammation. Then repeat the procedure.
Chapter Nineteen.
In replacing the nose's splint.
If physicians call the splint a *nasura*, and treatment with cauterization or a strong caustic as previously described has not cured it, then the only recourse is to incise the abscess when it is ripe and remove all the moisture or pus from it.
Until the bone is exposed. If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
This instrument, called the *khashna al-ras*, is made of Indian iron.  Its head is round like a small seed; it is engraved with the fine engraving of a rasp or scraper.  Place it on the corrupted area of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while slightly clenching your hand until you know that the corruption has been removed.
Repeat this several times, then treat the area with desiccated, astringent medicines.  If the area heals, flesh grows, the discharge stops, and forty days pass without recurrence, and without suppuration or other events occurring.
Then know that it is healed.  If not, there is no other recourse than to return the *nasura* to the nasal passage in this way: expose the bone again with an instrument or a caustic. If the bone is exposed, take a probe like this:
The tip of the iron instrument is triangular, and its shaft is a tapered cone that tapers to a point, as you see. Place it on the bone itself, near the nasal passage, and slightly away from the eye.  Then, rotate the instrument until the bone is pierced and the patient feels it.
When the patient feels air escaping from the nose when you hold your hand on their nose, then treat the area with astringent, desiccated medicines as I have instructed. When flesh grows and the area hardens, the material which was projecting outward will return to the nose, which will be less burdensome on the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On returning the protruding eye.
If the entire eye protrudes and there is no impairment or loss of vision, the patient should be made comfortable, then positioned on their back. A cupping glass should be placed on the back of the neck, without any specific conditions, and a gentle suction applied.
Then, apply a compress made from acacia, aloes, frankincense, and henna to the eye.  The eye should be bandaged from above with many strips.  The strips should be made by taking many soft linen cloths, folding each into four layers, and creating many such strips.
Then, place these strips one over the other as needed.  Tighten them firmly with a strong cloth.  Replace the cupping glass and apply suction without limitations.  Remove the cupping glass and keep the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the ligament relaxes during this time, it should be tightened again. Then, remove the bandage after one day and one night, as we said.  If you see that the eye has returned to its place, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the bandage, strips, tightening, and cupping until the eye returns to normal.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cutting the conjunctiva.
If a rupture occurs in the conjunctiva, protruding outside the eyelids as a distinct conjunctiva, and thus disfiguring the appearance, and you wish to cut it, then proceed as described.
To do this, insert a needle into the base of the conjunctiva from below upwards, then insert another needle with a double thread from the side of the tear, and pass it through. Leave the first needle as it is.
Then cut the bend of the double thread, tie some of the conjunctiva around the needle, and pull it tight.  Then remove the needle and place moistened egg white wool on the eye. Leave it until the threads fall out with the conjunctiva. Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  The conjunctiva may be pulled from all sides with a circular piece of cloth, to draw the eye outward. Then, with a thin scalpel reaching the back of the eye, drain the white moisture, causing the eye to sink and wither in its position. Then pull it tight until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of the hordeolum.
This affliction, called the hordeolum, is a swelling that collects in the eye, resembling descending water but without it.  The method of treatment is to have the patient sit upright on a chair, then take their head in both hands.
and move it until you see the swelling move downward with your eyes. Then stop, and do not move it. The light will return, and the patient will see things as they used to see them. If the swelling does not descend, then it is likely water. If the swelling does not move down with the method described above.
Otherwise, have the patient sit before you. Then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision on the cornea just where the inflamed tissue meets the cornea at the limbus until the matter is discharged.
Then, after the discharge, instill into the eye warm water, mixed with honey, or water in which you boiled fenugreek and honey.  Then treat by other methods until healed.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have previously discussed the types of water in the classification, and which are suitable for instillation with detailed explanations. You can find this information to establish the correct procedure.  Then, the patient should be seated before you, crouched, facing the light near the sun.
Bind and firmly hold his healthy eye, then lift the eyelid with your left hand if it is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then, place the tip of the cup near the limbus, a little thicker than a pearl, on the white of the eye at the side of the smaller angle, and push the cup forcefully while rotating it in your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel the cup has reached an empty space.
The cup should penetrate to a depth roughly equal to the distance from the pupil to the edge of the iris (limbus).  The copper, due to the clarity of the cornea, will be seen by the observer as though it were in the eye itself. Then the cup should be moved upward to the location of the water.
Then, press it downwards repeatedly. If the water descends immediately, the patient will see what has been opened to his sight immediately, with the cup in his eye, and then he will rest a little. If the water rises, lower it again without removing the cup.
If it settles and does not rise, remove the cup gently, twisting your hand a little at a time.  Then dissolve a little fine, pure rock salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it.  Then apply a moistened cloth or wool to the entire outside of the eye.
With rose oil and egg white, and bandage the sound eye. As for us and the people of our time, we place crushed cumin with egg white on it. If the cup does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes. Therefore, one should take the scalpel called the *bayrid*, which has this form:
Pierce only the adhered part with it, and do not overdo the piercing.  Rather, gently pierce a place suitable for the cup, and then insert the cup as mentioned earlier.  When your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm and secure bed, lying on their back in a dark room.
He must refrain from all movement and coughing.  His food should be soft, and he must not move his head to the right or left at all.  Keep the bandage on for three days. Then remove it in the same dark room and examine his vision.
Show him objects, then reapply the bandage for seven days.  It should not be done at the time of treatment, or after the cup is removed.  Rather, one should avoid this before the water rises quickly with excessive looking.
If a hot swelling appears, then the eye should be unbound before the seventh day and treated with remedies to relieve the swelling.  Once the swelling subsides, then release the sight, placing a cloth over the face that trains the sight from below, for several days in that dark room. Then...
He gradually exits the room and acts in his own affairs. Know that the student cannot avoid observing the cup multiple times before undertaking the procedure.  I have heard from some Iraqis that they create a perforated cup in Iraq that draws out water.
I have not seen anyone in our country do that, nor have I read about it in any book of the ancients.  It may be a recent development.  Here are images of various types of cups for him to learn about.
They are made of copper, specifically, and their tips are precisely of this thinness, triangular in shape, with sharp points.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In treating flesh growing in the nose.
Various superfluous fleshy growths may develop in the nose; some resembling scorpions with many legs, others a cancerous, hardened, dark flesh, and others a soft, non-dark flesh.
If these fleshy growths are soft, not malignant or cancerous, the patient should sit facing the sun, their nostril opened, and a probe inserted into the flesh.  It should then be pulled outward, and the portion grasped severed with a gentle, sharp scalpel, from a single direction.
To ensure all flesh has been removed, if any remains unsevered, gently scrape it away with a delicate instrument so that nothing is left; otherwise, bleeding or a hot swelling may occur.
If the growth is malignant, then promptly cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone.  Then, after the cauterization, apply vinegar and water or a drink to the nose. If the nose opens and moisture flows down into the throat, [the treatment is successful].
Know then that it has healed, if the moisture does not flow properly; then know that there is a fleshy growth on the upper, porous bones, which the instrument did not reach with the cut.  Then, you should take a thick linen thread.
Tie many knots in it, placing each knot a finger's width apart, or less.  The patient should maneuver one end of the thread into their nose with a probe or whatever tool is available, shaping it like a button, and pull it until it reaches the nostrils.
It will come out to the throat.  Children often do similar things in schools; it is an easy procedure for those who wish to do it.  Then bring together the two ends of the thread, one that came out of the mouth and the other that remains in the nose.
Then, use the knots in the thread to separate the flesh.  Do this until you know that the flesh has been separated by the knots in the thread. Then, remove the thread, and the thread now in the nose, after cleaning off the blood, is soaked in Egyptian salve.  Do this for three days or more.
Until the salve consumes all remaining flesh.  Then, the last thing in the nose will be a lead tube for a few days until it heals.  If further drying treatment is needed, use that.
This is an image of the applicator used to drip ointments and medicines into the nose.
It is made of silver or copper, resembling a small, open lamp, with an ointment channel.
Alternatively, you can make the tube closed like a reed, and the applicator's ointment-holding surface flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when heating ointments or any other fluids or substances in it.
Chapter Twenty-five.
Concerning warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Warts often grow on the tip of the nose, increasing and enlarging over time until they disfigure the appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance, removing the entire wart, and then apply either cauterization or a burning medicine, which acts as a cauterant. If it was missed until it grew large, observe whether it is hard, stony, dark-colored, and insensitive.
Do not use iron on it, for it is a cancerous tumor.  I have often witnessed that cutting this tumor has brought a great calamity upon the afflicted person. If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and I see that it can be completely cut away, proceed. Exhaustively remove the diseased portion and cut it without hesitation or delay. Treat the area with what dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If its connection is separated by a wound or similar, know that if a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, rarely will the treatment succeed, except in some people.
Therefore, if one of these things occurs, examine if the wound is fresh and bloody. If so, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the separation has parted its edges and each gap is sound, then one should peel back each gap with the thickness of its visible skin until it bleeds.
Then, bring the edges together with sutures, tightening them, and sprinkle powdered shiyan and luban on them. Place a plaster of palm ointment or another adhesive ointment on top. Leave it tight for two or three days, then remove it.
And change the medicine and leave it until the threads break of themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The method of suturing is to bring together the separation of connection, either with needles as we described in abdominal suturing, or with thread, as we explained there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing the knots that appear on the lips.
Many people may develop small, hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling carbuncles, others smaller or larger.  It is necessary to turn back the lip and cut at each knot, then remove them with forceps.
And cut it from all sides, then fill the area after cutting with powdered alum until the bleeding stops.  Then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas with what contracts them until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cutting excess flesh in the gums.
Excess flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called *apols*.  It should be grasped with forceps or a scalpel, cut at its base, and allowed the blood to flow.  Then, powdered alum should be placed on the area.
Or one of the astringent, dried powders. If that flesh returns after treatment, it often does.  Cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On cleaning teeth with an iron instrument.
Rough, unsightly scales may gather on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums.  These may turn black, yellow, or green, causing decay to reach the gums and making the teeth unsightly.
The patient should sit before you, with their head resting on your lap.  Clean the tooth and the area where the scales and sand-like matter have appeared until nothing remains.  Do the same for the black, green, and yellow discoloration, and so forth, until it is clean.
If the cleaning is successful from the first attempt, then stop. If not, repeat the cleaning the next day, and again on the third day, until the desired goal is achieved.  Know that a tooth requires various instruments of different shapes and forms, depending on the task.
Because the instrument used to clean inside the tooth is different from the one used on the outside, and the one used between the teeth has a different shape.  You should have all these different types of instruments prepared.
Chapter Thirty.
On the extraction of teeth.
One should try every remedy to alleviate the toothache before resorting to extraction, for there is no recovery after extraction, as it is a noble substance, so only extract it as a last resort.
Therefore, if the patient is determined to have the tooth extracted, ensure that the toothache has resolved. Often the patient is deceived by the pain, believing it is in a healthy tooth, and has it extracted, then the pain does not cease until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have witnessed this repeatedly in the actions of leeches.
If the toothache has subsided, then one should use a strong forceps to detach the gum around the tooth from all sides.  Then gently move the tooth, bit by bit, with your fingers or delicate pliers, until it loosens.
Then firmly grasp the tooth with large forceps, with the patient's head between your knees, making sure they do not move.  Pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of those instruments and gently insert it under the tooth from all sides and repeat the movement as you did before.
If the tooth is hollow or decayed, it is necessary to fill the cavity with a cloth and seal it tightly with a thin, smooth strip, so it does not break apart when you pull on it with the forceps.  And you must carefully detach the gum completely from around the tooth.
Exercise caution to avoid breaking the tooth, as a fragment left behind can cause the patient greater harm than the original pain.  Do not imitate the unskilled leeches, who pull teeth without using the methods we have described.
Often they inflict great harm on people, the least of which is breaking the tooth, leaving the roots whole or partially. Or the tooth may be pulled out along with part of the jawbone, as we have seen repeatedly.  After extraction, the patient should rinse with a drink, vinegar, or salt water.  If bleeding occurs at the site, which is common, immediately apply crushed alum to the area.
Otherwise, if the alum is ineffective, use fine forceps.  The forceps should have long arms and a short, thick handle, so it will not bend when you grasp the tooth.  This is an illustration of the large forceps.
The handles should be thick, so that when you grip them, they don't yield or bend.  The arms should be short.  The forceps should be made of Indian iron or tempered steel. The arms should have teeth that interlock, providing a firm and secure grip.
The arms can also be shaped like a file, providing a strong grip.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the extraction of tooth roots and the removal of fractured jawbones.
If, after extracting a tooth, a root remains broken, you should apply a piece of cotton soaked in oil to the area for a day or two to allow the area to relax, then use a probe or forceps. Those whose tips resemble the mouth of a bird called a *balrajah*.  This is an image of the forceps.
If it has been fashioned like a file inside or like a chisel, and these forceps do not succeed in extracting it, you should drill on the root and expose all the flesh with a lancet, then insert the instrument that resembles a small lever, whose image is this.
Short at the tip, slightly thick, and not sharp so as not to break.  If the root comes out with this, otherwise use the other instruments, whose image is this. The first one is triangular at the tip, with some thickness.
Image of another delicate, triangular one.
And we may also use this instrument with two prongs, whose image is also this.
And with other instruments and metal tools that are mentioned in the inventory of teeth.  We may also use this instrument, which resembles a large fishing hook, whose image is this.
Triangular at the bent tip, with some slight thickness so as not to break, and should not be sharp. And know that instruments for teeth are numerous, and so are other instruments; they are almost countless. The skilled craftsman, by his craft, may invent instruments for himself according to what the work and the illnesses themselves indicate.
Because some illnesses did not have instruments mentioned by earlier authors, due to the diversity of their types.  If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decayed, then search for it in its position with whatever of these instruments and forceps that are mentioned in extracting roots is suitable for it.
And we use a forceps, whose image is this.
It should have some slight thickness to hold the bone, so it does not slip until the bone is removed.  We will treat the area with appropriate medications. If the bone has a slight decay, then remove its decay and blackness until it is clean and then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
In the eruption of teeth that sprout over others.
Teeth that erupt out of their natural path disfigure the appearance, particularly in women and slaves.  Therefore, one must examine.  If a tooth has erupted behind another tooth,
If it cannot be moved or extracted, remove it. If it is stuck to another tooth, cut it off with this instrument, whose image is this.
It resembles a small beak, made of sharp Indian steel.  Cut it in several days due to the tooth's hardness, so as not to loosen other teeth.  If it is protruding and firmly rooted, cool it with an Indian file, which has this image.
It should be entirely of Indian steel, with extremely delicate carvings, like the file used to make needles.  Cool the tooth little by little over many days, gently, so as not to loosen and cause it to fall. Then smooth it and clean it with various instruments.
If a tooth has broken off, causing pain to the tongue when speaking, then it should also be cooled until the roughness of the break is gone, it is smooth, and no longer harms the tongue or disrupts speech.
Chapter Thirty-three.
For fastening loose teeth with silver or gold thread.
If older teeth become loose and shift due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot eat because of fear of loss, and if binding remedies have been ineffective.
The solution is to tie them with gold or silver thread. Gold is better, as silver tarnishes and rots after a few days, while gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of medium thickness and thinness, appropriate for the space between the teeth.
The method of tying is to take the thread, insert its loop between the two sound teeth, and then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, one or more, until the weaving reaches the sound tooth on the other side.
Then weave back to the starting side, pulling gently and wisely so that it does not move at all.  Pull the thread at the roots of the teeth so it does not slip.  Cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them, twist them with the forceps, and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth.
So that the tongue is not harmed. Then leave it fastened like this.  If it loosens or breaks, fasten it with another thread.  Enjoy it this way for all time.  This is the illustration of the teeth and the method of tying in two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
A single or two teeth may be repositioned and secured as described, and remain.  A skilled craftsman does this.  He may carve a piece of ox bone to resemble the tooth and place it in the empty socket. And fastens it as we said, so it remains.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the ligament that lies beneath the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament beneath the tongue may be either natural, present at birth, or accidental, resulting from a healed wound.
The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth, placing their head on your lap, and lifting their tongue.  Then, cut the nerve ligament transversely so the tongue is freed.  If there is some stiffness or complexity, and this is from a healed wound, use a probe to pierce and cut it transversely, until the ligament is severed and the knots are loosened.
Beware of cutting too deeply into the flesh and severing an artery, leading to bleeding.  Then, after the cut, rinse with rosewater or vinegar and cold water.  Next, place a linen wick under the tongue, for the patient to hold in place every night.
To prevent re-adhesion.  If bleeding occurs, apply powdered alum to the area. If the bleeding is excessive, cauterize the area with a suitable lens-shaped cautery iron. Then treat him with other remedies until he is healed.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On removing the toad generated under the tongue.
A swelling resembling a small toad may develop under the tongue, hindering the tongue's normal function, and possibly growing to fill the mouth.  The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth facing the sun and examining the swelling.
If you see it dark-colored or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation, do not attempt treatment, for it is cancer.  If it leans toward white and has moisture, use a probe to cut it and gently split it with a scalpel, removing it from all sides.
If blood flows excessively during your work, apply powdered alum until the bleeding stops.  Then resume your procedure until the entire growth is removed. Finally, have the patient gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with the rest of the appropriate treatment until healed.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On the treatment of tonsil tumors.
Any growths that sprout in the throat, including tumors, may present glands inside the throat that resemble those on the outside, called tonsils. If treatment according to the classification does not effect a cure,
If the tumor is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive, do not use the iron to treat it.  If it is red and its origin thick, do not use the iron either, for fear of blood loss.  Instead, leave it until it ripens, either causing it to shrink or to burst on its own.
If it is white, round, and its origin thin, this is what should be cut. Before operating, observe if the inflammation has completely subsided, or if some reduction has taken place.
Then, have the patient sit facing the sun, head in your lap, mouth open.  Take an assistant, and have them press the tongue downwards with an instrument, like this:
Made of silver or copper, thin like a knife.  When the tongue is pressed down and the tumor is clearly visible, take a probe and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it outwards as much as possible without pulling anything from the membranes.
Then, cut it with an instrument, shaped like scissors, but with both ends curved, both edges very sharp.  Made of Indian steel or Damascus steel.
If this instrument is unavailable, cut it with a scalpel, like this:
Sharp on one side, blunt on the other.  After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same way.  Then, after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, have him gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or rue leaves, or similar astringents, have been boiled, until the bleeding stops.  Then treat him until he is healed.  Other tumors may grow in the throat, besides the tonsils, and these are cut in the same way as the tonsils.
I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a small, hard, almost completely obstructing growth.  The woman was breathing through a narrow passage.  It had prevented her from eating or drinking.
She was on the verge of death if she had lived another day or two. The tumor had two branches that extended to her nostrils.  I acted quickly and inserted a hook into one, pulling out a healthy piece.
Then I cut it where it protruded from the nostril.  I did the same with the other nostril.  Then I opened her mouth and pressed down on her tongue.  Then I inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut off a portion of it, with only a small amount of blood flowing.
The woman's throat cleared, and she immediately drank water and ate.  We continued to cut away from that tumor repeatedly for a long time, and the tumor would regrow in place of what we cut away.  This went on for a long time, both for me and for her.
I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside her throat, hoping to stop its growth.  Then I left the area. I do not know what happened to her after I departed.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On the excision of a tumor of the throat.
If a tumor, called 'ʿunaba', descends into the throat and swells, and is white and oblong, it is called a 'ʿamūd'.  If it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called an 'ʿunaba'.  If treatment as described in the classification was ineffective.
If I see that the hot tumor has subsided and is thin, it should be excised.  But if it is a solid, round mass with no length, and is red, or the color of a bruise, or black, or without sensation, then its excision should be avoided.
There is danger for the patient. Therefore, if you see it with the characteristics mentioned, its whiteness and length, the patient should sit facing the sun, and the tongue should be pressed with the instrument whose description was previously given, then the snare should be inserted into the 'ʿunaba'.
It should be pulled downwards and cut with one of the two instruments mentioned for the excision of the tonsils.  Only the portion exceeding the natural extent should be excised, and no more, for if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after excision, use what we described for the excision of the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is hesitant about excision, then use a method of cauterizing it without fear or caution. The method of cauterization is with a sharp medicine, placing the patient's head on your lap.
Then press the tongue with the instrument we mentioned, then take the sharp water mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, mix it with quicklime, neither thick nor thin, and fill the hollow of this instrument. This is its image:.
The end of the instrument where you place the medicine should be concave like the bowl of a wooden spoon.  Place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient should lie on his side, so that saliva flows from his mouth from inside the throat, lest something should descend from it into his throat and harm him.
Then, hold the medicine in your hand and press it onto the uvula for about half an hour until you see it has blackened and the burning of the medicine has subsided. If you prefer, take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the end of a wooden spoon, and soak the cotton in the medicine.
Insert the wooden spoon with the cotton into the tube from above so that the cotton adheres to the uvula.  Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it; it will wither and fall off in three or four days. If you need to repeat the application of the medicine, do so.
After cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in ghee, and remove any remaining medicine from the surrounding area. Then, rinse with cold water and treat externally with poultices and internally with gargles until healed. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further from fear.
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cauterization or cutting, using incense in this manner:  Take frankincense, zoffa, sage, sisymbrium, shih, chamomile, and qaysum, and similar herbs.  Gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
And boil, with the pot sealed with clay of wisdom, and a hole in the lid to fit the hollow instrument, made of silver or copper:
Insert the end with the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the uvula through the tube, causing the uvula to contract.  Repeat this several times until it withers.  Be careful not to perform this treatment in the initial stage of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling.  Instead, one should do this when the inflammatory swelling has subsided.  If this instrument is unavailable, take a reed and attach a hard-boiled egg shell to its end so that the patient's mouth is not burned.
Because the egg shell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth, and this is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On the removal of thorns and other foreign objects lodged in the throat.
A bone, fish thorn, or other foreign object often becomes lodged in the throat.  One should remove anything visible with the eye, after depressing the tongue with an instrument in the direction of the sun.
To make clear what is in the throat, and if something is hidden and not visible in the throat, then the patient should vomit before his food is digested in his stomach.  Perhaps the lodged object will come out with vomiting, or the patient might swallow a piece of lint or a piece of lettuce stalk.
Or he may swallow a piece of dry bread, or take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a thread, and then swallow it. When it reaches the position of the thorn, quickly pull the thread repeatedly.
Frequently, the thorn or bone will adhere to it and come out. If it does not come out by the methods mentioned, use a lead instrument in this way:
It should be slightly thicker than a lead rod, and at its tip there should be a bend. The patient, with their head raised, should gently insert it into their throat, being careful not to touch their throat, lest it cause coughing, and thus dislodge the bone or thorn.  Alternatively, the physician can insert it with their hand.
Having the patient insert it is better, as they know the location of the lodged object.  They push it downwards or pull upward with the instrument, according to what is possible, until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
On removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If the leech, using the medication mentioned in the classification, proves ineffective, then examine the patient's throat in the sunlight, after having pressed the tongue with the instrument I described.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a gentle, firm forceps.  If this is not successful, take a hollow tube, insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, and then insert a heated iron into the tube.
Do this several times. The patient should abstain from drinking water all day.  Then, he should take a bowl filled with cool water, open his mouth over it, gargle, and not swallow a drop.  He should move the water with his hand occasionally.
If the leech feels the water, it will fall off. If it does not come out by the method described, fumigate the throat with urine and hellebore using the instrument described for the fumigation of the larynx.  Do this several times; it will fall off.
The method for fumigation is to take a vessel containing embers heated by fire.  The vessel is covered with a lid having a hole in the center.  Place the end of the instrument into this hole.  Place the medicine for fumigation into the vessel and have the patient place his mouth on the end of the tube and close his mouth to ensure the fumes reach his throat.
If the leech falls off at this stage, if not, the fumigation is repeated several times. The patient endures thirst, eats salty food and garlic, and does not drink water.  The leech must come out with this procedure.  This is the form of the instrument to extract the leech from the throat, when seen.
It resembles pincers, as you see, except that it has this curve that goes into the throat.  Its tips are like a bird's beak; there is the roughness of a file on them, so if they grasp something, they do not let go.
Another instrument is used to restrain the tongue. It is a wide ring of iron, sized to fit the mouth over the tongue.  It is inserted into the mouth, standing on its side, keeping the mouth open against the patient's will.  The patient cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument used to open the mouth in this exact manner.
Chapter Forty.
In it is the discussion of the lancing and incision of tumors.
Tumors are of many varied types, as will be described individually in this book.  Their lancing and incision differ in two ways: one is the type of tumor itself and the humors it contains.
And the second type is according to the locations in the body where they occur, because a tumor occurring in the head is different from a tumor occurring in the buttocks, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy area is different from a tumor occurring in a joint. Each has its own method of treatment.
Some tumors should not be lanced until the pus has matured and is complete; others should be lanced while still immature, such as tumors close to joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and grows to the point of causing decay around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing the impairment of that limb, or the tumor may be near a vital organ.
Because if you delay lancing it until it matures, you will harm the vital organ, or if it is near the buttocks, lance it while still immature.  It is necessary to lance a tumor that is immature and near the buttocks so that the pus does not spread and penetrate the buttocks, causing a fistula.
It will become incurable to some degree.  You should know when to lance tumors that have fully matured; this is when the tumor's pain subsides, the fever disappears, redness and swelling lessen, the head of the tumor softens, and other such signs appear.
The incision should be made at the lowest part of the tumor, if possible, to allow the discharge to drain downwards, or at the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor.  And the incision should run lengthwise if the tumors are on the arms or legs.
And the locations of the muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries—and generally, all flat, unyielding areas—should be considered.  For areas that bend, the incision should follow the shape of the area.  If the tumor is in a fleshy area, it is best to leave it alone.
Until its maturity is complete, as we have stated. If you lance it before that, the pus will drain excessively, causing considerable harm and uncleanliness; and sometimes its edges and interior will harden. Some tumors may be incised across the body if necessary or in a way that suits the affected limb.
For small tumors, a single incision should be used. For large tumors, a wide incision or several incisions, depending on the size of the tumor, may be needed.  Some tumors may require the skin to be incised or cut, if they have become like a rag.
Some have reached a state approaching death, as often seen in many abscesses and hidden tumors. Some are incised in a three-angled manner, while others are cut like a rue leaf, like the tumor of the groin.
Some require a round or crescent-shaped incision, or similar incisions.  If the tumor has no head, like a smooth, flat tumor, a simple incision should be made. If the tumor is large and has developed for a long time, and you have lanced it, do not rush to drain all the pus at once.
Instead, drain some of it, and then compress the tumor for another day, and then drain some more pus. Repeat this gradually until all the pus is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an elderly person, the animal spirit often weakens with a sudden discharge of pus.  The patient might die without you realizing it.  Beware of this point greatly.
After lancing these tumors, you should clean the wound and inspect it. If the tumor wound is small or the incision simple, use a bandage of linen or worn cotton. If the tumor is large and the incisions numerous,
You should insert a thread into each incision until they reach one another. If part of the skin is torn or raised, you should fill it with worn cotton or linen strips, without moisture, and compress it for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with appropriate ointments until healed. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, after soaking a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding site repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the methods and treatments, and cauterization, described in many places in this book and in the sections. If it is winter and the tumor area is highly sensitive, you should wet the bandages with a warm drink and oil.
And place them on the area. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply bandages soaked in water and oil, or in a cool drink and oil.  Once the third day has passed, as we said, you should dissolve the swelling and clean it.
And use similar treatments until it heals. This is what you need to know about treating tumors in general.  As for detailed methods, each tumor's treatment has been described in a summarized and categorized manner.
Chapter Forty-one.
On the treatment of tumors that appear on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp, a type of swelling contained within pouches, resembling a hen's egg. Their types are numerous, some fatty, others containing moisture like mud.
Some contain moisture like porridge and soup, and similar things. Others are stony and hard.  There is no danger in cutting them open and removing them, unless a blood vessel is encountered during the incision.
The procedure for opening them is to first probe them with the instrument, which will be illustrated later, called a *midas*, to know what they contain. If they contain moisture, cut them lengthwise with a simple incision, like this:
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~.  If the moisture is discharged, remove and cut away the entire sac that contained the moisture. Do not leave any part of it, for it often returns if any remains.
Then dip a cotton swab into the *sur-i* ointment, if available, or else into salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it until the next day, for it will consume any remaining portion of the sac.  Then, repeat the application with the *sur-i* ointment, once or twice more, if necessary.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains fatty matter, cut it in this way:
Make a cross-shaped incision, and place forceps on the edges of the wound. Remove it from all sides.  Strive to remove the peritoneum that contains it. If an artery is encountered, do what was previously described for it.  Do the same for the swelling if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as previously mentioned.  The incision on a hardened swelling is easier because it has less blood and moisture. Some of these swellings in the head in some people contain no moisture at all. I incised a swelling in...
the head of an elderly woman. I found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone. It could not be broken, even if someone threw it to shatter it.  The other swellings that occur on the heads of children are not like this.
At the bases of the ears, make a simple incision across the entire area. Make the bottom part thinner to allow the material to drain downwards. Then treat it with appropriate remedies.
Chapter Forty-two.
Concerning the incision on swine that often appear on the neck.  These swellings frequently occur on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin.  They may also appear elsewhere on the body.  Sometimes only one appears on the neck, sometimes many, and some arise from others.
Each swelling has its own enclosed sac, as do the swellings in the merchandise and on the head, as we described.  These swellings are of various types: some are stony, some contain moisture, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
Of those that I examined, some were well-disposed to touch, their surface appearing close to the color of skin. They moved in all directions, were not attached to the neck nerves, veins, or arteries, and were not deeply embedded. Then it is necessary to incise it with a simple incision from top to bottom of the body, along the line ~J~ to line ~B~.
Remove it from all sides, and stretch the skin's edges with a hook or two hooks, or many hooks if necessary, as we said concerning swellings of the head.  Withdraw it bit by bit, ensuring the neck is not cut by any vein or nerve.  Let the scalpel not be excessively sharp.
Lest your hand cause further cutting, or distress the patient, leading you to cut what is not necessary. If you cut a vein or artery, and that prevents your work, then place powdered styptic or some of the substances that stop bleeding in the wound.
Close the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides, the wound relaxes, and putrefaction begins.  The bleeding will stop at that point. Return to your work until finished.  Then, check with your index finger if there are any remaining small pieces, and if so, cut and remove them.
If a large vein is found at the root of the piece, it should not be cut from its base, but should be tied with a strong doubled thread, and left until it falls out on its own without harm.  Then fill the wound with old cotton, which has been dipped in Egyptian ointment, and treat it.
If the entire piece is cut, the edges of the wound should be brought together and stitched immediately, after confirming that there are no remnants left. However, if you see a remnant of the piece of flesh, do not stitch.
You should aim your cut at the base and root of the piece, using the suturing and what we have mentioned. If the pieces contain moisture, apply a light dressing where you see the area of ripeness. Make the dressing below, as we said.
Then, after the dressing, use a poultice with Egyptian ointment, or similar, to consume any remaining corruption.  Once you see the wound is clean, treat it with healing ointments until it heals.
Chapter Forty-three.
On slitting the throat for a tumor occurring inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this slitting of the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it.  This is in accordance with their statements.  However, those with quinsy should avoid slitting the throat, as they will not benefit from it.
In order that all tumors and the lung be diseased, and those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no problem with the windpipe, the slitting of the throat is necessary to escape the harm caused by suffocation.
Therefore, if we wish to do this, the throat should be slit under three circles of the windpipe or four small slits transversely between two circles, as much as the slit would be in the diaphragm, not in the cartilage. This place is appropriate for the slit.
Because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant, if the surgeon is cowardly, he should extend the throat's skin with a hook, then slit the skin until, when he reaches the windpipe, he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he slits the diaphragm that we have described, and evidence for slitting the windpipe is found in the phlegm that comes out of it with what is punctured, and from the cessation of the voice.  The wound should be left open for a time.  When the time of fearing suffocation has passed, the wound's edges are brought together with skin.
Then he sews it alone, excluding the cartilage.  Afterwards, the medicines that promote flesh growth are used until healing occurs.  The author of this book says, "The explanation of this passage we have narrated is that it is applied when the patient's throat is obstructed by one of these tumors that we have mentioned.
When the patient is close to death and fears to die, they proceed to slit the throat, so that the patient breathes through the wound, and is saved from death.  They are instructed to leave the wound open until the disease's course is completed, and its duration is three days or similar.
At that point, they were instructed to sew up the wound and treat it until healed.  What I personally observed was that a servant took a knife and slashed her throat, cutting some of the lung's windpipe.  I was summoned to treat her, and I found her weakening like a slaughtered animal.  I uncovered the wound.
I found that the blood coming from the wound was slight, so I was certain that she had not cut an artery or vein.  Air was escaping from the wound.  I quickly sewed up the wound and treated it until she was healed.  The servant suffered nothing except a slight hoarseness of voice; nothing more.
After a few days, she returned to her best condition.  Therefore, we say that slitting the throat entails no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the incision of the tumor that appears in the larynx from the outside, and is called a tumor of the larynx.
This tumor, called a tumor of the larynx, is a large tumor the color of the body.  It is common in women and comes in two types.
Either it is natural or incidental. The natural one has no remedy, while the incidental one comes in two types; one similar to fatty tumors, and the other similar to a tumor arising from arterial complications, and incising it is dangerous. Therefore, one should not use iron on it at all, unless it is small. If you probe and examine it with a probe, and find it resembles a fatty tumor and is not connected to any vessels, then incise it as you would a tumor. And remove it with whatever is inside the sac if it is in a sac, otherwise remove everything completely, then treat the area with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter forty-five.
On the incision of various tumors.
Tumors are of many types, and all their types are mentioned in the classification. Here we must explain the difference between a tumor and an abscess, as it is problematic.  I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat, fever, and fearful pains until the boiling of the matter subsides. And when the pus matures, the fever and severity subside. A tumor is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain. It is contained within a serous sac, its own special container, and is the same color as the surrounding body.  It begins like a boil and becomes like a wheal, larger or smaller.
And there are two types: either fatty or containing moisture. The colors of the moisture are numerous, as mentioned in the classification. Therefore, when you set about treating a tumor, you must first probe and examine it with the instrument called a probe, as its image will be shown in the chapter following this one.
Assess the size of the swelling, then withdraw the probe and observe what follows. If fluid of any color emerges, make a simple incision, as described in the treatment of other tumors. If no fluid follows the probe, know that it is fatty.
Incise it with a firm incision in this manner, as I have taught you.  Suspend it with forceps and carefully dissect the skin from all sides, and if possible, remove the sac containing the tumor intact.
If the sac breaks during the procedure and you cannot remove it intact, which often happens, remove it piece by piece so that nothing of it remains, for if even a small portion remains, the tumor will likely recur.
If you are unsuccessful and a small portion remains, cauterize the wound with sharp cauterizing agents when you are finished, then compress the wound and apply a remedy to soothe the inflammation. Treat it with other methods until it heals. If the tumor is large, suture its edges and treat it with procedures for healing wounds.
If a bleeding vein, either pulsating or not, arises, immediately cauterize the affected area with powdered alum and leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound suppurates and the bleeding subsides.  Then proceed to remove any remaining part of the tumor.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On the forms of instruments.
The instruments used for incision and extraction, among them are spatulas, which are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large spatula.
Image of a medium spatula.
Image of a small spatula.
Made of tempered steel, square-ended and tight for quick entry into tumors, these are images of probes, called "bard," and are also of three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
It is suitable for searching tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities for what is inside of them, such as bones, and more.  It is made round, polished, and smooth like a whetstone, from Chinese brass, or spadruia, or brass, or iron, or silver.  The best is made from spadruia.
Probes may also be made of black lead, and are suitable for probing fistulas that have a bend in their depths, as it can bend easily with the bend.  They are also three types, some long, some medium, and some short.
According to the need of each fistula's depth, and its thickness according to the fistula's breadth and narrowness, image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks, which are numerous types.  Some are simple, meaning they have one hook, and these are three types: large, medium, and small.  There are also blind hooks, which are three types.  There are also hooks with two hooks, which are three types. And there are curved hooks with two hooks. And there are three types of them.  There are also hooks with three hooks, which are three types.  All these types each require their appropriate place.  Image of a large, simple hook. Image of a medium-sized simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.
Image of a large blind hook. Image of a medium-sized blind hook.
Image of a small blind hook.
Image of a large double-hooked instrument. Image of a medium-sized double-hooked instrument. Image of a small double-hooked instrument.
Image of a large three-pronged instrument.
Image of a medium-sized three-pronged instrument. Image of a small three-pronged instrument.
These are images of the scalpels used to cut and dissect tumors and fleshy growths. There are three types, large, medium, and small. Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium-sized scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its cutting edges are limited, while the other ends are not, but this is so that it can be used to dissect the tissue without fear of cutting a nerve or tendon, and to help the patient find some relief from the burning sensation experienced when removing the tumor.
These are images of the retractors. There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large retractor.
It is made from polished brass, similar to a copper spatula.  On one end is a wide, two-layered spoon-like shape, where a hidden scalpel blade is located at the head, resembling a bird's tongue, that can be moved in and out as desired.
Images of the blunt-ended dissecting instruments that are used to dissect tumors between the fingers without causing the patient any sensation.  There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large dissecting instrument.
Images of the cupping instruments used to draw blood.  There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large cupping instrument.
Made of copper or bronze, slightly elongated and rounded, as you see.  It should be thin.  You should have both large and small sizes of these cupping instruments to quickly draw blood in emergencies, when medicine is unavailable.
But do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body.  Use them on fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, abdomen, groin, and similar moist fleshy parts.
Other small tools, resembling pistachio shells, can be made from them, like this image.
Blood is drawn with them if it flows from a phlebotomy site or when a vein or artery is cut.  It can also be made round, like this image.
Chapter forty-seven.
In the treatment of the male breast.
The breast of some people may swell at the age of puberty until it resembles a woman's breast, remaining swollen and unsightly.  If one dislikes this, one should make an incision in the breast, a crescent-shaped incision, like this shape.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with the medicated ointment, then bring the edges of the wound together with stitches and treat it until it heals. If the breast droops and relaxes due to the bone, as happens with women.
One should make incisions in its upper sides, two incisions resembling a crescent shape, each connected to the other at their ends, so that the larger line is encircling the smaller one, in this manner. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then the skin between the incisions is peeled off, the fat is removed, and the mentioned sutures, stitches, and necessary treatment are used until it heals.
If the incision does not encompass what needs to be cut due to the patient's distress or bleeding, then the wound should be packed with cotton soaked in the corrosive ointment and left to consume any remaining fat, then treated until healed.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On the treatment of tumors appearing under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the pig-like, solid, sac-containing type.  Some contain moisture.  Those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~.  If all the moisture in the tumor is expelled, pack it with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until healed.  If the tumor is the knotted pig-like type, incise it as we described for pig-like tumors; if the wound extends so as to discharge pus, then use cautery, as we previously described.
Chapter Forty-nine.
Incising the tumor that appears beside the artery or vein, and is called an aneurysm.
If the artery is wounded and the skin above it adheres, a tumor often results.  Similarly, a vein may also display swelling and a tumor.
The signs by which one knows whether the swelling and puffiness are from an artery or a vein: if from an artery, the swelling is oblong, compressed into the depth of the body, and when you press the tumor with your finger, you feel a crackling sensation.
That which is from the vein, the swelling is round on the surface of the body.  Incision on these tumors is dangerous, especially in the armpit, groin, neck, and many other parts of the body, and if they are very large, one should avoid treating them with iron.
And those also that are in the limbs or the head should be avoided.  For any swelling from the mouth of the artery, make a lengthwise incision in the skin, then open the incision with hooks, and then dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath it and pierce it to the other side.  Tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I described to you in the ligation of the arteries in the temples.  Then pierce with the lancet the spot between the ligaments until all the blood within it is expelled.
The swelling will subside, then use the treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from a ruptured vein, you should grasp as much of the swelling with the skin as possible.  Then insert a needle below the place you grasped with your hand, and pierce it, with a doubled thread in it, until you bring it out from the other side. Then tie the swelling firmly, according to what I told you about tying the hernia at both ends of the thread.  If you fear that the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling at the intersection of the first needle.
Tie your threads in four places, then slit the swelling in the middle until what is inside comes out. Cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied. Then place a compress soaked in a drink and oil on it. Then use treatment with twisting and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
In the swelling that arises from nerve twisting.
Just as swelling occurs in arteries and veins, swelling also occurs in nerves if there is a blow or excessive fatigue or the like.  This is more common in the wrists and ankles.
And in every location where joints move, it is a hard swelling resembling the color of the rest of the body.  It is mostly without pain, and if pressed hard, the patient feels a sensation like numbness. The swelling is not deeply embedded in the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, but does not go forward or backward.  Whatever is in the joints should not be treated with iron, as it may cause a festering wound.  And whatever is in the head or forehead...
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the swelling is small, grasp it with a forceps and cut it from the root. If it is large, suspend it with a hook and strip it, then remove it. Close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On the cutting of warts that appear on the abdomen.
Warts, called fungous because of their resemblance to mushrooms, frequently appear on the abdomens and other parts of the body of some people. Their base is thin and their head thick; sometimes their lips are fused. Some are small, others very large.
I once observed a man with two warts on his abdomen, resembling mushrooms in appearance. Their thin, whitish bases had fused, and their lips were cracked, constantly oozing moisture. I cut them off, and their weights were approximately eighteen ounces and six ounces respectively.
When cutting them, if the affected area is moist and the wart's color is white, moist, and thin-based, cut it with a broad scalpel.  Have a cautery iron ready, as considerable bleeding often occurs during the cutting process.
If bleeding is profuse, cauterize the area. If the affected area is sensitive and reacts to the iron cutting, take a strong lead thread and tightly bind the wart. Leave it for two days, then increase the tightening of the lead thread, continually tightening it.
Continue tightening until the wart breaks off and falls away on its own, without any difficulty.  If the wart has a thick base, there is some risk in cutting it, especially if it is on the abdomen, but it may be possible to cut off half or part of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat the wound until it heals. Beware of cutting a wart that is dark in color, insensitive, and dull in appearance, for it is a cancerous tumor.  We will discuss cancer later.
Chapter Fifty-two.
On treating umbilical growths.
Umbilical growths may arise from many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum on the abdomen, from which pus or intestines protrude, as occurs in other hernias; or from blood issuing from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from accumulated gas.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and the discharge of pus, the tumor will be similar in color to the body, soft and painless, and its position will be irregular. If it is due to the protrusion of intestines, its position will be even more irregular than what we have described; when you press it with your fingers, it will disappear, then reappear; perhaps there will be rumbling accompanying it; and it will increase greatly in size during bathing and severe exertion.  If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
If it does not disappear when pressed with your hand, and does not increase or decrease, then if it is due to blood, the swelling will, along with these signs, appear dark. If it is due to a growth of flesh, the swelling will be hard, solid, and unchanging in size.
If it is due to gas, its touch will be soft.  The treatment in this case is to observe.  If the umbilical protrusion is caused by blood from an artery or vein, or by gas, then it is advisable to refrain from treatment, as this carries risk and uncertainty, as I informed you in the chapter where I discussed tumors caused by arteries and veins.
If the umbilical protrusion is caused by the intestines or pus, you should instruct the patient to hold themselves still and stand upright, stretched out, then apply a bandage around the entire navel area. Then, instruct him to lie on his back before you.  Then, make a wide incision around the navel, in the area you marked with the bandage.  Then, pull the center of the swelling upwards with a large hook.  Finally, tie the incision site with strong thread or silk cord, firmly.
The knot of the bandage should be a running knot.  Then, open the center of the swollen area, stretched above the bandage, and insert your index finger.  Search for the intestine.  If you find it has been caught by the bandage, loosen the running knot and push the intestine back into the abdomen.  If you find pus, pull it out with a hook.
And cut off any excess.  If an artery or vein obstructs you, tie it off.  Then return to your work. Take two needles, and thread strong threads into them. Insert the two needles into the incision you made around the swelling, making sure they pass completely through.  Then, pull the swelling tight at four points on the needles.
If you prefer, remove the needles and leave the area until the pulled flesh becomes putrid and falls off on its own, or cut it off if it becomes thin and putrid.  Then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.  If the umbilical protrusion is from flesh that has grown there.
Or if it is from moisture, then it is necessary to cauterize the swelling, as we said, and remove the blood or moisture you find there.  Then treat it with what will heal the area.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medications, and warned against treating it with iron so that it does not ulcerate.  We also mentioned cancer originating in the uterus, and warned against its treatment.
The ancients stated that if the cancer is in a location where it can be completely excised, such as cancer in the breast or thigh, and similar removable organs, especially if it is small and nascent, then it should be completely removed. However, if it is advanced and large, then one should not approach it.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve this.  If it is located in a removable area, as we have said, one should proceed, easing the patient's condition with black salve several times, and then cauterize it if there is a clear accumulation of blood vessels.
Then the patient should be placed in a position that facilitates the procedure, then appropriate hooks should be inserted into the cancer, and it should be cauterized from all sides with the skin, thoroughly, until nothing of its roots remains. Allow the blood to flow, do not cut it quickly.
Instead, squeeze the affected areas and remove all thick blood with your hand or any available instruments. If the procedure causes a large bleeding from a severed artery or vein, cauterize the affected area until the bleeding stops, then continue with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the treatment of scabies.
We have previously described the types of dropsy, how water accumulates, the signs of each type, and its treatment with medications.  Only the "zāqī" type is treated with iron; the "ṭabīʿī" and "lahmī" types should never be treated with iron.
If you have treated this "zāqī" type of scabies with medication and it has not been effective, then examine if the patient has extreme weakness or another illness besides the scabies, such as...
If there is coughing, diarrhea, or similar conditions, avoid treating it with iron, for that is dangerous.  If you see a strong patient, with no illness other than scabies, who is neither a child nor an elderly person, then act by having the patient stand before you. and a servant behind him will squeeze his abdomen with his hands, pushing the water downwards towards the pubic region. Then, take a pointed scalpel in this manner:
narrow at both ends, long, and pointed like a scalpel, but with a slight curvature to prevent it from entering the intestines during use and harming them.  Then, observe if the scabies originated from the intestines.
Then, the incision should be three fingerbreadths below the navel, aligned with the pubic region.  If the scabies originated from liver disease, the incision should be three fingerbreadths to the left of the navel.  If it originated from spleen disease, the incision should be three fingerbreadths to the right.
Furthermore, the incision should not be on the side the patient intends to lie on, to prevent fluids from flowing to that weak area.  Then, pierce the skin with the instrument all the way through, then insert the instrument into the incision and lift your hand.
With the scalpel, separate the skin from the peritoneum as if you were peeling it.  The amount you peel should be roughly the size of a fingernail.  Then, pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches the empty space where the water is located.  Then, remove the water and insert the instrument, which has this shape, into the hole.
It is like a thin tube made of silver, brass, or smooth polished leather.  It has a small hole at the bottom and three holes on the sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Its tip may have a small, pen-like probe, like this image.
At its top, there is a ring.  If the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately drain from the instrument. Drain the water in a moderate amount, for if you drain more than necessary at once, the patient may die due to the dissolution of their vital spirit.
Or he may suffer an almost fatal faint.  However, drain it according to his strength and what his pulse and complexion indicate.  Then, remove the instrument and contain the water, for it will stop flowing immediately.
Due to the skin obstructing the opening in the peritoneum, which you were told to smooth in that manner, then use the instrument again the next day if the patient seems capable of tolerating it.
Remove also only a small amount of water.  Do this for several days, remaining vigilant and avoiding mistakes, until only a little water remains.  If you fear for the patient and leave much water, treat him with burial in hot sand.
Excessive sweating in the bath and sun, enduring thirst, and treating him with dried remedies until he recovers.  Cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water, as described previously.
Chapter Fifty-five.
In treating infants born with unperforated or narrow or misplaced urinary passages.
Some boys may be born with their penises unperforated, and it is necessary to perforate them from the moment of birth.
With a very thin scalpel, in this manner:.
Then, insert a thin lead nail into the opening, bind and hold it for three or four days. When urination is desired, remove it and then replace it.  If you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine passing through the area may not allow the opening to close.
And as for those with a narrow opening, it is treated with lead, as we said, for many days until it widens.  And those whose opening is in the wrong place, such as those born with the opening at the end of the penis, are unable to urinate forward.
Until the urethra is raised by hand, and semen cannot reach the uterus straight, which is a very bad condition. The treatment for this is for the patient to lie on their back.
Then, stretch his penis firmly with your left hand, and trim the head of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, like a sharpener, or as if you are carving something, to make the middle prominent, like a penis, and to place the opening in the center as it should be.
Be careful during your work to avoid bleeding, as it often occurs.  Apply something to stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-six.
Concerning the sores that appear on the foreskin, shaft, and dark discoloration, decay, and adhesion of the foreskin to the shaft.
This sore often appears on the urethra, a fleshy, dark protrusion, and can be malignant or non-malignant.  The non-malignant one should be caught with a delicate hook.
Cut it completely until it is cleansed, then apply a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it with palm ointment until it heals.  If the sore is malignant and dark-colored, cauterization should be used after cutting and removing the affected area.
If the sore is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and part of the sore is inside the foreskin and part outside, the portion inside should be removed first, and when it has healed, then treat the outside portion.
Because if you treat both at the same time, you cannot be sure that the foreskin will not become perforated.  It can also appear in women, and on the foreskin, blackness and decay may occur.  All blackened areas that threaten to decay, or have already decayed, should be cauterized.
Then apply honey over it, along with crushed and sifted pomegranate rind and creosote.  Then treat it with further remedies until it heals.  If bleeding occurs, use a crescent-shaped cautery iron in this manner:
Cauterization is beneficial in both cases, meaning bleeding and the ulceration of a wound. If the foreskin ulceration has completely decayed, a lead tube should be inserted into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it.  As for adhesion of the foreskin to the glans...
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin was healthy and did not require circumcision. Adhesion can also occur from a wound or a tumor.  The foreskin should be peeled back with a sharp scalpel until the ligament is loosened and the glans is separated from all sides.
If it is difficult to separate them by careful examination, then a small part of the glans and foreskin should be peeled back.  The foreskin is thin, so it may easily tear due to its thinness. Then, separate the foreskin and glans with a thin, damp linen cloth that has been soaked in cool water, so that they do not stick together again.
Then treat with a styptic drink until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-seven.
On the purification of boys and treatment of errors affecting them.
Circumcision is nothing more than separating a connection, like other surgical procedures. However, since it is an act of our own will and is particularly used on boys, we must establish the best procedure for it.
The easiest path to safety, I say, is that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because it was not practiced in their laws; rather, it is something we have adopted.
Through experience, I found that the majority of artisans and barbers use purification with a scalpel and scissors, and use forceps and ligatures with thread and cutting with a knife. I have tried all these methods.
I found nothing better than purification with scissors and tying with thread, because purification with a scalpel often causes the skin to tear, as the foreskin has two layers; perhaps the outer layer is cut while the inner layer remains.
One must then cut again, causing further pain.  Purification with forceps does not guarantee that the end of the urethra is not cut, as it may have entered the opening.  As for purification with a knife, the skin might tear, ruining your work, or the child's skin might be naturally too short.
Many are born in such a way that they do not need purification, and I have seen this.  As for purification with scissors and tying with thread, experience showed me its superiority because the scissors make even cuts, for the blade on top is identical to the blade on the bottom.
When you squeeze your hand, the blades cut in the same manner and at the same time, so the thread becomes a wall for the urethra's skin from all sides, leaving no errors.  First, you must reassure the child.
Especially if he is slightly understanding, explain that you are only tying a thread to his urethra and will leave it until another day.  Then, please cheer and delight him by any means that you can.  Then, stop him before you, standing upright.
Do not have him sit; hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so the child's eyes do not see them or any other instruments at all. Then insert your hand into his urethra, inflate the skin, and pull it upward until the head of the urethra emerges.
Then, cleanse it of any accumulated dirt.  Then tie the marked spot with a doubled thread, then tie a second thread a little lower.  Then, grasp the lower tie with your thumb and forefinger, firmly, and cut between the two ties. Then quickly pull the skin upward, exposing the head of the urethra. Allow the blood to flow a little; this is better and lessens urethral swelling. Then, dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle dry, burnt pumpkin ash over it; this is the best I have tried, or else finely ground cumin seed powder, which is also excellent.
Then quickly pull the skin upward, exposing the head of the urethra. Allow the blood to flow a little; this is better and lessens urethral swelling. Then, dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle dry, burnt pumpkin ash over it; this is the best I have tried, or else finely ground cumin seed powder, which is also excellent. Then, place it on a poultice of a hard-boiled egg in rosewater, beaten with soft, fine rose oil, and leave it on overnight. Then, continue treating it with the rest of the treatment until healed.
This is a suitable scissor design for the procedure.
The scissors should be straight, sharp, and nail-like.  The blades should be the same length as the handles.  A mistake in the procedure is that sometimes the inner skin is all or partially turned inside out during cutting; therefore, it should be pulled back using your fingernail before the area swells.
Cut it [the skin] straight. If you can't grip it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days pass and the area beneath the head of the urethra remains swollen, leave it until the inflammation subsides and gently remove the skin.
Cut it as best you can, and be mindful of the head of the urethra.  If a bit of the urethral head is cut, it won't do harm. Treat it using the poultices described in the chapter on poultices.
If more skin is cut than necessary and it retracts upward, that is not much of a concern either. Treat it as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-eight.
On treating urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to obstruction by a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or growing flesh, and the like. If you treat it with the various treatments described in the classification, as previously mentioned.
If the urine has not been released, and you suspect the retention is due to a stone that has damaged the neck of the bladder, the patient should be placed on their knees, then one leg should be placed on the patient's back.  The patient should extend their abdomen toward their back and hold themselves as firmly as possible.
This will force the bladder neck to push the stone backward, allowing the urine to flow. If the urine does not flow as described and the patient's condition worsens, the extraction of the stone using an instrument called a catheter, whose image is [as follows]: should be employed.
It is made of silver, thin and smooth, hollow like a bird's feather tube, about one and a half spans in length. It has a gentle funnel at its head.  To draw the urine with it, one should take a doubled thread and tie a piece of wool or cotton securely to one end.
The thread's end is inserted into the lower end of the catheter, and any excess wool is trimmed with nippers so it can be inserted into the tube, sealing it like a stopper.  Then, the catheter is lubricated with oil, butter, or egg white, and the patient sits on a chair.
The bladder and urethra are softened with moist ointments or lukewarm oil and water.  Then, the catheter is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra.  The urethra is then pulled upward towards the navel, and the catheter is pushed inside.
Once the urethra is pulled, the catheter is pushed inside until it approaches the rectum.  The penis is then tilted downwards, the catheter inside, and pushed until it reaches the bladder, where the patient feels it has reached an empty space.
This is done in this way because the channel through which urine flows is curved.  Then, the thread with wool is pulled slightly tightly, so the urine follows the wool.  Then, it is removed, and the urine is drained, and the catheter is reinserted.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Images of the instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or of hollowed ivory.  They have a long, slender tube, and one would wish to instill water and medicines into it.  This is done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its image.
Made of silver or hollowed ivory, it has a long, slender tube, hollowed completely except for the end, which is solid with three holes; two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
The hollowed portion where the projectile is, should be just large enough to hold it without any excess, so that if you draw something of the moisture, it is drawn out; and if you push it, it is pushed out to a distance, just as the oil-sling used in naval warfare does.
If you wish to remove moisture from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull the projectile upward.  The moisture is drawn into the syringe.  Then, insert the tip into the urethra, as we described in the catheters, and push the moisture out using the projectile.
Then that moisture will reach the bladder, so that the patient feels it.  This is also an image of a gentle enema, used to irrigate the bladder.
It is made of silver or a leather-like material. Its upper end resembles a small funnel, and below it is a groove where the cord is placed. Then, a camel's bladder is taken, and the moisture with which you wish to irrigate the bladder is placed inside it. Then it is firmly tied between the two grooves with a doubled thread.
Heat that moisture slightly over the fire. Then insert the tip of the irrigator into the urethra.  Then firmly press on the bladder with the moisture, until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment, make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around. Then, tightly insert a thread into these holes, circling them. Then, fold the circle as a table is folded, having placed in it whatever moisture, ointments, and water you desire.
Then tie it to the instrument and use it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On removing stones.
We have previously described the types of stones, their treatment with medications, and the differences between kidney stones and bladder stones, along with the signs of each.  We have also discussed stones where manual removal and incision are necessary.
This is specifically the stone formed in the bladder, and which develops in the urethra.  I will describe this clearly and concisely.
I say that bladder stones are most common in children.  A sign of this is that the urine is discharged from the bladder, thin like water.
Sand is visible in it, and he rubs and plays with his penis, often hanging down.  Often, the anus is also affected.  Children recover more easily from this before they reach fourteen years old, while it is more difficult in the elderly.  For young adults, it lies in between.
Those with larger stones are easier to treat, while the opposite is true for smaller stones.  If we turn to treatment, one should first administer an enema to evacuate all the waste in the intestines, as this may prevent the stone from being found during examination.
Then the patient is taken by the feet and shaken downward to make the stone descend to the neck of the bladder, or he is made to jump from a high place repeatedly.  Then, you should sit him upright before you, with his hands under his thighs, so that the entire bladder tilts downward, and then examine him.
And feel for it from the outside.  If you feel the stone in the space, immediately make an incision on it. If it is not felt at all, you should anoint the index finger (if the patient is a boy) or the middle finger with grease from the left hand.
If it is a fully grown boy, insert it into his rectum and search for the stone. Once it is under your finger, move it slowly to the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the area you intend to incise.
And instruct a servant to compress the bladder with his hand, and instruct another servant to extend the buttocks upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to extend the skin beneath the buttocks toward the area where the incision will be made. Then take the dissecting forceps, which has this shape:
Make the incision between the buttocks and the pubic area, not in the middle, but on the side of the left hip.  The incision should be directly over the stone. Your finger should be in the rectum, pushing the stone outward, angled so the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, as much as possible to allow the stone to pass out.
Do not press too hard, as the finger in the rectum might dislodge the stone during the incision, causing it to come out without difficulty.  Know that some stones may have angles and edges, making their removal difficult.
Some are smooth, like acorns, and round, making them easy to remove.  Those with edges and angles, increase the incision slightly. If it still does not come out, you must devise a way to remove it, perhaps using a tightly fitting forceps with a rasp-like tip.
To grasp the stone firmly, so it does not slip, or perhaps insert a flexible, curved instrument underneath it. If that is not successful, widen the incision slightly. If excessive bleeding occurs, stop it with a cautery.
If there is more than one stone, first push the largest one towards the bladder opening, then make an incision on it.  Afterwards, push the smaller stones out.  Do the same if there are more than two.  If the stone is extremely large, one should not make a large incision, as this would expose the patient to one of two outcomes.
Either he dies, or he has constant dribbling of urine, because the wound will not heal.  Try to push it out, or devise a way to break it with forceps to remove it piece by piece.
After completing the procedure, treat the wound with kandar, sabr, shiyan, and shiddah. Place a bandage soaked in oil, syrup, rosewater, or cold water over it to reduce inflammation. The patient should lie on their back, and the bandage should not be removed for three days.
Once the swelling subsides, wash the area thoroughly with water and oil. Then treat it with the palm ointment and the basil ointment until healed.  If excessive inflammation, festering, or similar problems arise in the wound, such as blood clotting within the bladder preventing urination, which is recognizable by blood in the urine, occur.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove the blood, for its remaining will lead to bladder corruption and infection.  Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of condition with a corresponding therapy until healed.
Throughout the treatment, the thighs should be bound together to secure the medications applied to the affected area. If the stone is small and has lodged in the urethra, causing inflammation and preventing urination, treat it as described previously before it ruptures.
Often, this treatment obviated the need for incision.  I have tested this method, using a steel file of this shape:
A triangular, sharp, pointed steel file is attached to a stick.  Then, a thread is used to tie the penis below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder.  Gently insert the file into the urethra until it reaches the stone.
Rotate the file gently against the stone, gradually attempting to pierce it until it penetrates to the other side.  Urine will then flow.  Then, grasp the remaining portion of the stone on the outside of the penis; it will crumble and exit with the urine, curing the patient.
If this treatment is not possible due to an obstacle, tie a thread below the stone and another above the stone. Then, incise the stone on the penis between the two threads, and remove it.
Then, untie the threads and cleanse the coagulated blood in the wound.  The thread was tied below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other thread was tied above to allow the skin to return to its place and cover the wound after the stone is removed.
Therefore, when tying the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns to its place and covers the wound, as we have said.
Chapter Sixty-one.
On removing stones in women.
Stones rarely form in women. If one of them presents with a stone, treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons, one of them being that the woman may be a virgin, and another that you will not find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or from among those with close relatives, and thirdly, that you will not find a woman skilled in this practice, especially in manual work; and fourthly, the site of the incision on the stone in women is far from the stone's location, so a deep incision is required.
In that case, there is a risk. If necessity demands it, a skilled female physician should be sought, though this is rare.  If not available, seek a virtuous and discreet male physician or have a skilled female midwife or a woman experienced in this craft present.
She should be present and instructed to perform all the examinations necessary to locate the stone.  First, if the woman is a virgin, a finger should be inserted into her vagina to search for the stone; if found, it should be pressed against the finger.
Then instruct her to make the incision. If she is not a virgin, but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina to search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
If found, she should guide it from the opening of the bladder downward, as far as possible, until it reaches the root of the thigh.  Then, she should make an incision in the vicinity of the middle of the vulva, at the root of the thigh, from whichever side the stone appears to be located.
Her finger should remain on the stone, pressing it. The incision should initially be small.  Then, a probe should be inserted into the small incision. If the stone is felt, the incision should be enlarged as much as is necessary to extract the stone.  Be aware that stones come in various forms.
They vary in size, smoothness, roughness, length, shape (round, and branching).  Know their types so that you may recognize what you want. If bleeding is excessive, apply pulverized astringent to the area, holding it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your procedure.
Until the stone is removed.  Ensure you have the tools mentioned for removing stones from men, to assist you in your procedure. If bleeding is excessive, and you know from the pulse that it is from a severed artery, apply a styptic to the area.
Hold it firmly in place with the styptic, and do not repeat this procedure. Leave the stone alone. If the patient dies, then treat the wound. After a few days, if the wound is no longer bleeding or is beginning to fester, resume the procedure to remove the stone.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
In the case of a water tumor.
A hydrocele is the accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum that is beneath the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle.  It may also occur in a special membrane created by nature on one side of the testicle.
So that it might be mistaken for another testicle, and it lies between the scrotum and the white peritoneum which we have mentioned. This occurs rarely.  This hydrocele results from weakness, affecting women, into which this substance accumulates, or it may arise from a blow to the affected area.
This moisture takes on various colors, either yellow, or blood-red, or dark-red, or white, which is the most frequent.  The signs by which it is recognized.
Where water accumulates, if it is in the white peritoneum mentioned, the swelling is somewhat oblong, like an egg, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If the moisture is in a special membrane of its own, the swelling is rounded on one side of the testicle.
For this reason, one might imagine it as another testicle. If the moisture is between the scrotum and the white peritoneum, it is palpable.  To ascertain the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe previously described; judge its contents by what emerges from under the probe.
If we turn to treatment with iron, the patient should be bled if possible, and if you see his body is full, then he should lie on his back on something slightly elevated, placing numerous cloths underneath, and you should sit on his left side.
Have a servant sit on his right side, extending his penis to one side of the scrotum and toward the lower abdomen. Then, take a broad scalpel and make a lengthwise incision through the scrotum, from the middle, towards the groin.
The incision should be made in a straight line parallel to the line dividing the scrotum in half, until reaching the white peritoneum.  Carefully dissect it, avoiding further incision;  focus your dissection more on the side of the testicle, and continue dissecting as much as possible.
Then, dissect the water-filled peritoneum widely, removing all the water.  Separate the edges of the incision with forceps, and lift the peritoneum upward, avoiding contact with the scrotum. Cut the peritoneum as much as possible, either all at once or piece by piece.
Especially the thin part; if you do not completely sever it, there is a risk of the water returning. If the testicle emerges from its covering during your procedure, return it to its place, then sew the edges of the scrotum together.
Then treat it as you would any other surgical wound until it heals. If the testicle is already damaged by another disease, you should tie off the vessels in the suspensory ligament to prevent bleeding, then remove the testicle from the suspensory ligament and take out the testicle, and then treat it as described earlier.
If the accumulated water is in both areas, know that they are two hydroceles. Incise the other side as you did the first, or if you prefer, perform the procedure once. Then clean the blood.
Place wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions, and place another layer of wool soaked in medicated wine and oil over the testicles and the abdominal wall.  Cover this with folded bandages (the *rafā'id*). Tie it (the bandages) from above with the six-pronged bandage, in this manner:
Then, take two bandages, sew them together, and fill them with fluffy wool, in this manner.  Make the fastening ends from cotton or damp wool, and secure them tightly with a belt around the trousers. One of the fastening ends is placed on the buttocks, towards the back.
The second fastening end goes towards the pubic area, and the other two ends go along the lower thighs. The remaining two ends are placed on the upper thighs. All the fastenings are brought together in the belt around the trousers.  These hydroceles can also be treated with cauterization instead of incision with an iron.
This involves taking a gentle, heated, knife-like cautery iron and cutting through the testicle's skin, until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed. Take another cautery iron, in this manner:
It resembles a Greek eye; then, using it while hot, cauterize the peritoneum until all the moisture is expelled.  Then, using forceps, stretch the peritoneum and cauterize the surrounding layer, cutting it as much as possible to remove the entire hydrocele, being careful not to burn the testicle.
Know that this method is safer and avoids blood loss, and is superior to incision.  If during the incision or cauterization a hot swelling or bleeding or something else occurs, you should treat it accordingly with the appropriate remedies, as described previously.
If the patient is timid and cannot endure this procedure because of its unpleasantness, let him use the cauterization method as described, if it is valid in your opinion according to the evidence provided earlier.
If the hydrocele is watery, the patient should sit on a raised chair, then cauterize the swelling from below with a wide spatula.  Make the cauterization along the body and keep the opening wide so all the water drains out. Then apply cotton to the area and bandage it.
Allow the remaining water to drain, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not drain during the cauterization, it is because the white membrane obstructs the opening of the wound and prevents the water from escaping.
In that case, you should insert a goose feather, or the instrument used for drawing out the water of hydroceles (a description of which has already been given), or slightly enlarge the wound opening.
Know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so.  If it does, cauterize it in the same manner and the patient should be treated accordingly.
Sixty-third Chapter.
On the treatment of fleshy fistulas.
Know that a fistula on these fleshy tumors is often a dangerous condition leading to death.  Therefore, it is best to leave it alone and seek safety.  I will describe the procedure and the types of tumors involved.
I say that many tumors can arise in the organs of the female anatomy, for various reasons.  Sometimes, it comes from a sharp, concentrated discharge to the female organs; sometimes from a blow.  The tumor's color will be the same as the body's, and it will not contain any water.
The tumor will be hard, and possibly stony, with a dark color and no sensation.  It may be caused by the entanglement and swelling of arteries, as previously mentioned, or by the swelling of veins.  If caused by arterial swelling, this is recognized by the tumor's unevenness.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be incised.  However, if it is caused by swelling of the veins, nothing will dissipate when pressed with the fingers. This type can be incised, as can other fleshy tissues.
The procedure is to incise the scrotum, then pull the testicle upward, remove it from the white peritoneum, free the attachments from the vessels, tie the vessels, and cut the attachments after freeing them from all sides of the testicle. If the testicle has adhered to the growing flesh.
Then the testicle must be removed and cut. If the adhesion is between parts of the peritoneum or between the vessels, all such adhesion must be freed and cut in a circular fashion.
If the fleshy growth is in the area of attachment behind, all of it must be cut and the testicle removed, as we have said.  Once your work is done, dress the wound with wet wool, rose-oil, and drink, then treat it with further remedies until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
On treating the dropsy associated with dropsy.
Dropsy is a twisted swelling, somewhat like a cluster, with relaxation of the limbs, making movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the afflicted person.  Treatment for this condition is similar to what was previously mentioned.
However, we should note the method used by the ancients in this case.  I say that the afflicted person should sit on a raised chair, then pull the relaxed limbs downwards, and hold the scrotum skin with your fingers, along with the vessels close to the penis.
A servant of yours should hold it and stretch it firmly.  Then, with a wide, sharp scalpel, make a slanted incision near the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.  Then, dissect from every side as I described to you in the dissection of the arteries in the temples.  Then, insert a needle with a double thread into them.
Tie it at the initial points where the dropsy presented, and also at its end.  Then, make a vertical incision down the middle, to remove the collected, putrid, corrupted moisture.
Then, treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, allowing time for the vessels that nourish one limb to recede.  There is no harm in that.  If the dropsy affects all the vessels, then one limb should be removed along with the vessels, lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, it will wilt and be of no use.
Chapter Fifty-six.
On the treatment of intestinal dropsy.
This dropsy arises from a tear in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen, approximately at the groin area of the abdominal wall, causing the intestines to protrude into one of the testicles.
This hernia may result either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its stretching.  These two types occur due to various causes, including blows, leaps, shouts, or lifting heavy objects.  If it's from stretching of the peritoneum, it develops gradually over a long time.
It does not appear suddenly.  The swelling is gradual, extending deeply because the peritoneum compresses the intestines.  If it is from a tear in the peritoneum, it is initially accompanied by severe pain, and the swelling is visible, distinct, and close to the skin's surface.
This is due to the intestines protruding outside the peritoneum.  Fluid may also protrude with the intestines, making this dropsy intestinal and fluid-filled.  It may also contain air, and the intestines may become filled with feces, which could lead to the patient's demise.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially when compressed.  Treatment for these types of ailments with iron is dangerous; therefore, one must be cautious.  The procedure involves instructing the patient to push the intestines back inside their abdomen if they can return.
Then, he should lie on his back with you positioned above him, and his legs should be raised.  Then, pull up the skin around the groin area, and cut the skin of the scrotum all the way lengthwise. Then, insert hooks into the edges of the cut, as much as needed to open the cut further.
The incision should be as wide as possible to allow the testicles to protrude.  Then, peel back the peritoneum beneath the scrotum's skin until the firm, white peritoneum is visible from every side.  At that point, insert your index finger into the area below the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum under the testicle's skin and the second peritoneum, release the adhesions behind the testicle.  Then, use your right hand to pull inward on the scrotum's skin, while simultaneously using your left hand to pull the white peritoneum upward and lift the testicle and peritoneum towards the incision.
Instruct the attendant to pull the testicle upward, while you fully release the adhesions behind it.  Use your finger to check for any twisted intestines within the firm white peritoneum.  If you find any, push them back into the abdomen below.
Then, take a needle with a thick thread, twisted from ten strands, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum beneath the scrotum's skin, near the incision.  Then, cut the ends of the thread so that there are four strands remaining. Then, braid some of the strands together and tightly tie the peritoneum, which we said is beneath the scrotal skin, on both sides.  Then also tie the ends of the threads tightly so that nothing from the blood vessels that feed it can reach it. To prevent a painful swelling.  Also, make a second ligature, positioned outside the first, a distance of less than two finger widths away.  After these two ligatures, leave a section of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a finger bone.
To prevent a painful swelling.  Also, make a second ligature, positioned outside the first, a distance of less than two finger widths away.  After these two ligatures, leave a section of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a finger bone. Cut the rest completely around and remove the testicle. Then, make a cut beneath the scrotal skin, one that bleeds and oozes as we previously described. Then, use wool soaked in oil, placing it in the wound, and apply the ligature as we described.
The white peritoneum, which we mentioned after cutting it, may need cauterization to prevent bleeding, as this often occurs.  Leave the ligature until it falls off by itself. If it is slow to fall off, apply hot water and apply something to sweat it off until it comes away.
Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for surgical wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
In this windy colic, I have seen no one dare treat it with iron.  The ancients described a treatment, as we described for colic with a fistula, in that the vessels are to be tied gently below the incision.
Then it is incised in the center, and the swelling is treated to open it, until the vessels fall out.  Treat the wound as we described until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Six.
In the hernia that occurs in the groin.
A hernia in the groin may appear, as we said, bulging the area, but nothing from the intestines descends into the groin.  If it does descend, it is slight and always returns.
But if it persists for a long time, the opening in the peritoneum increases so that the intestines and the testicle descend into the scrotum.  This occurs due to the extension of the peritoneum in the groin, as we said. This is because the peritoneum extends and then relaxes, causing the area to bulge, and the treatment is by cautery, as I previously described.
And it can be treated with iron in this manner: the patient lies on their back before you, then you make a transverse incision in the bulging, protruding hernial area, about the width of three fingers, and then you cauterize the peritoneum under the skin.
Until the white peritoneum beneath it is exposed.  Then you take a thread, place it on the protruding area of the peritoneum, and press it into the depth of the abdomen.  Then you stitch the two protruding areas on the thread of the peritoneum, and sew one to the other.
Then you pull out the thread, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernias.  Then treat it with surgical treatments.
When the sutures are broken, clean them, and dress the wound until it heals.  Then the peritoneum contracts, and the hernia does not increase.
And this method is superior in this location, because it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-eight.
Relaxation of the scrotum's skin.
The scrotum's skin often relaxes in some people without the underlying tissues relaxing, which makes the appearance unattractive.  Therefore, those who wish to treat this should have the patient lie on their back.
He should cut all the relaxed skin away from the thick skin, then bring the edges together.  If desired, one may first stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, securing the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the other treatments for wounds until it is healed and the stitches fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
For this reason, I should not have mentioned it in this book.  However, I have done so for two reasons: one is so that a physician, if asked, will be knowledgeable about it and will know the treatment for those who are afflicted; the other is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our benefit.
For example, sheep, oxen, and cats, and similar animals.  I say that castration comes in two types, either by crushing or by cutting.  The method of crushing is to place the animal in hot water until its testicles relax and soften and hang down.
Then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer distinct to the touch.  As for castration by cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and grasp the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the cords and make one cut on each testicle.
Until the testicles protrude, then cut them after peeling them, leaving nothing of the membranes except the thin membrane that is on the vessels. This method of castration is better than that which is done by crushing.
Because crushing might leave a part of the testicles, and the animal may desire to mate.  Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In the treatment of hermaphrodites.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types. One appears in the area around the groin or on the scrotal skin, between the testicles, resembling a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from the area on the scrotal skin.
In women, there is one type, located above the vulva on the pubic bone, like small, protruding male testicles. One of them resembles a man's penis, and both resemble female genitalia.  The treatment for these three types.
The two types of men and the one type of women, the excess flesh must be cut so as to remove its effects, and then treated with the treatment of other wounds until healed.  As for the second type of man from whom urine issues from the scrotal skin, no treatment is effective and no healing occurs.
Chapter seventy-one.
In the excision of the clitoris and the protruding flesh of women's vulva.
The clitoris may grow beyond its natural size, becoming unsightly and discolored.  In some women, it may enlarge to resemble that of a man, interfering with sexual intercourse.
One should grasp the excess clitoris with one's hand or forceps and cut it off, but not excessively, especially not into the depth of the root, lest excessive bleeding result.
Then treat it with surgical remedies until it heals.  As for the flesh that grows, it is flesh that sprouts in the vaginal opening until it fills it up.
And sometimes it protrudes outward, like a tail. Therefore, some earlier practitioners called it the "tail disease."  One should cut it off, like the clitoris, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-two.
On the treatment of dislocations.
Dislocation is when a woman's vulva is not perforated or the perforation is small, and it may be either natural at birth or accidental.  The accidental case arises from a preceding cause, which may be from excess, overgrown flesh.
or thin or thick peritoneum, and it may be in the depth of the uterus or in its sides or above or below it. It prevents intercourse, procreation, and childbirth, and may even prevent menstruation.  Recognition of this is through examination by a midwife.
If the obstruction is visible and near, but if not visible, let her examine it with her fingers or with a probe. If the obstruction is from thin peritoneum and is close to the labia, then quickly pierce it.  This involves placing something like a splint on the labia, then placing both thumbs on it.
And the woman is on her back with her legs spread, then she stretches the labia forcefully until the thin peritoneum is pierced and the obstruction opens. Then she takes wool, soaks it in oil, and places it on the area, and the woman is to have intercourse each day so that the area does not close up again.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, then it should be cut with a wide scalpel resembling a thin leaf. If the obstruction is from overgrown flesh, then it should be suspended with forceps and cut.  Have with you remedies to stop bleeding without causing further wounds, such as acacia, myrrh, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then a wide lead tube is used to prevent the wound from closing quickly; it is held in place for days.  Dry linen thread is used, and then the wound is treated as with any abscess until it heals.  Another growth of flesh may appear in the uterus, and it should be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous growth, the cancerous tumor that is in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red boils that appear in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the veins' openings, causing a constant flow of copious blood.  If hemorrhoids progress, they become warts.  Their types and signs were mentioned in the classification, and we describe them here.
Regarding those that accept treatment and those that do not: I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if deep within the uterus and not perceptible to touch, have no treatment with iron.  Those in the mouth of the uterus, which are felt, are treatable.
The woman should enter a cool room, and then the warts should be scraped with a scalpel or a rough cloth, and cut from their roots.  Then, when blood flows from one of the blood-cutting instruments, they should be dusted without pricking.
Such as acacia, cinnamon, and frankincense, etc.  Then, raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding persists, seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rind, and astringents, etc. Then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
Apply this to her back.  If the bleeding stops, then stop.  Otherwise, apply leeches to the pubic area, breasts, without restrictions.  Then take wool, dip it in the juice of mugwort, or the juice of goat's rue, or the juice of willow branches, with astringent drink, and apply it to the affected area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals.  As for the red sore, it resembles the heads of boils, having a rough appearance.  It should be cut away as much as is visible, as described for warts, and treated until healed.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
On treating a tumor in the uterus.
Many types of tumors can appear in the uterus, such as cancer, stony tumor, ulcers, wasting disease, devouring disease, polyps, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors.  All of these diseases and their types and symptoms have been discussed in the classification.
In this treatise, we must describe the hot tumor that appears in the uterus, if it is one of the tumors that have collected for a time.  How should it be treated with iron?  One must observe whether the initial pain of the tumor is sharp, accompanied by throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
And if you see it red, if touched, do not rush to treat it with iron. Treat it with what aids maturation until these symptoms subside.  Then, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats, leaning back.
And she should bring her legs towards the lower abdomen, spreading her thighs, and placing her arms under her knees, binding them with a suitable bandage.
Then, the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument that opens the cervix, a picture of which will be shown later.  When using this instrument, one should estimate the depth of the woman's uterus to ensure that what enters from the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
For if the instrument is longer than the depth, this will injure the patient.  Therefore, pads should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the uterus. The spiral that runs in the instrument should be on the upper side.
While you hold the instrument, the servant rotates the spiral until the cervix opens.  If a boil appears and is soft and tender when touched, it should be incised at the head with a broad scalpel.  Once all the matter has been evacuated.
A soft wick soaked in rose oil or green oil with some astringent should be placed in the wound. The wick should extend out of the slit in the cervix, and pure wool soaked in boiled water should be applied to the outside of the uterus and the pubic area.
Then, it should be treated with the appropriate ointment for two days until healed.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting water and honey, then water boiled with a long-stalked sos or zarawand root.  Then, return to the ointment, if the boil is hidden within the uterus.
One should refrain from treating it with iron, but rather treat it with what we mentioned in the classification.
Chapter seventy-five.
On instructing midwives how to treat living fetuses that emerge in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the natural form of childbirth.  Its signs include the woman's descent to the lower parts, her desire to breathe the air, and the easing of her postpartum discomfort.
If the delivery proceeds quickly, know that this birth is natural.  The fetus emerges headfirst, with the placenta either attached or hanging from its umbilical cord. If you observe these signs, then you should massage her abdomen to expedite the delivery of the fetus.
If it descends headfirst, the placenta descends with it, and is thoroughly cleansed of impurities.  Any birth not conforming to this pattern is unnatural and objectionable, as the fetus might emerge on its feet, or with its hands and feet coming out before the head.
And one hand, or one foot, or its head and hand, or it emerges curled, or perhaps turned upside down, and similar objectionable forms. The midwife should be skilled and gentle with all these things, and wary of mistakes and errors.
I am describing each form and how to deal with it so that you can recognize it. If the baby emerges headfirst, the natural way, and the delivery is difficult for the woman, and you see her strength waning, then have her sit on a chair and instruct other women to support her.
Bind her uterus with cooked licorice root and moist ointments. Then, the midwife should insert a small scalpel between her fingers to sever the placenta, or cut it with her fingernail, so that the moisture within it drains.  Massage the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman should be injected with licorice root saliva mixed with shellac ointment. Then, after the injection, instruct her to cough and sneeze using a stick, and hold her mouth and nose. The fetus will emerge soon. If the baby's hands emerge first, gently push them back in gradually.
If entry is still not possible, place the woman on a platform, raise her legs, and shake the platform on the ground while the woman holds on to prevent falling during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them out gently; it will come out. If the fetus emerges on its feet, push the feet up, then gradually turn the fetus to straighten it, and then gently pull one leg gradually.
If they emerge to the thighs, tell her to cough and sneeze with the stick; it will come out. If it does not come out as described, gradually return the fetus to its natural shape, and it will come out smoothly. If it still resists, as described.
Take saliva from the *khatmi* plant, saliva from licorice root, shellac ointment, and dissolved gum. Grind all thoroughly in a mortar. Then apply this mixture to the woman's vagina and lower abdomen.  Then, have her sit in lukewarm water until the lower intestines are reached.
If you see that the lower part has softened, make a poultice from myrrh and apply it.  If she holds it for an hour, have her sit on a chair, then sneeze, and plug her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen; the fetus will emerge immediately. The fetus will come out on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, gently insert your hands, and then the woman lies on her back, with her hips hanging down, on a bed, and holds her hands together, then gently press on top of her abdomen. Then remove the cushions under her legs so that her feet are elevated. If the fetus does not come out, take both legs and move them vigorously, then press gently on top of the intestines until the fetus ascends.  Then the midwife inserts her hand and shapes the fetus gently.
Instruct the woman to strain until the fetus emerges. The fetus will emerge sideways, with one arm hanging down.  Try to reposition the arm; if you cannot, have the woman stand and walk. If she cannot walk, have her lie down.
Shake her legs vigorously, then use the poultice described from saliva. If the delivery is delayed, have her sit in a chair, then try to reposition the arm and straighten the fetus. Have the woman sneeze and instruct her to strain until it emerges.
If the fetus emerges on its back, arms outstretched, and face towards its mother's back, the midwife should grasp the fetus's hand and gently turn and straighten it. Once straightened, apply the fat and saliva as previously described.
Then instruct her to move slowly.  Once she does, have her sit in a chair and lean to her right side.  Instruct her to strain and have her sneeze with the instrument (kandus).  This will cause the fetus to emerge, upright on its side.
If the fetus and placenta descend in this manner, cut the placenta with your fingernail until the moisture is released. If it is clinging to the fetus's face or neck, cut it from the umbilical cord so it doesn't suffocate and die. Then push the fetus inward until it is positioned correctly.
Instruct the woman to strain repeatedly; this will result in an easy delivery.  Regarding the delivery of twins or multiple fetuses, know that twins are frequent; sometimes three or four are born and survive, but this is rare.  Five is unnatural and they will not survive.
They are surrounded by a single placenta, even if numerous, and separated by a membraneous partition attached to the umbilical cord of each.  They may be delivered like a single fetus—naturally and easily—or be delivered in a difficult manner, as we have described.
If any of them are difficult to deliver and present the unnatural forms mentioned, treat them as described.  Let the midwife be gentle and do everything gently and carefully, using any available means to achieve safety.
It is possible for one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten fetuses to develop in the womb, and it has been confirmed to me that one woman miscarried seven and another fifteen, all of them conceived.
By the decree of the all-knowing, all-powerful God, this knowledge must be possessed by the midwife, so that she may be prepared for such an eventuality.
Chapter Sixty-seven.
On the delivery of a stillborn child.
If, after treating the stillborn child with the methods of treatment described in the section on treatment, the child does not emerge, and you are forced to intervene manually, then you must observe the woman.  If she is strong and healthy, and does not show any symptoms that cause concern for her well-being, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
Her head should be tilted downwards, and her legs raised. A servant should hold her from both sides, or secure her to the bed, to prevent her body from moving as the fetus is delivered.
Then, moisten the mouth of her uterus with moist ointments, along with the saliva of the nose, fenugreek, and flaxseed. The midwife then anoints her hands with these ointments and saliva, then gently inserts them into the uterus.  Then, she searches for a place to insert the hooks, targeting the appropriate locations on the fetus.
Observe; if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, insert the hooks into its eyes, or back of the neck, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or collarbone, or in locations near the ribs, or under the breastbone.
And if it descends feet first, then into the pubic area and the middle ribs.  The hook should be held in the right hand, its point positioned between the fingers of the left hand. The hand should be gently inserted and the hook implanted in one of the aforementioned locations.
Until she reaches an empty space, then inserts another or a third hook if needed to ensure an equal pull and prevent it from tilting to one side.  The pulling should be even, not just in a straight line, but also moving it in all directions.
To facilitate its removal, just as one does with a tooth when extracting it.  And in between, the pull must be relaxed. If it is caught on one side, the midwife should anoint some fingers with ointment and insert them to turn whatever is obstructing it.  If part of the fetus is expelled, the hooks should be moved to other locations.
She should slightly raise it to do this until the entire fetus is expelled. If a hand emerges before other parts and cannot be returned due to compression, it should be wrapped in a cloth and pulled until it is all out, and then it should be cut.
Either at the wrist joint or the elbow.  Likewise, this should be done for the other hand and the feet. If the fetus's head is large and encounters resistance during expulsion or has collected water in the head, a pointed instrument should be inserted between the fingers.
With it, the head is split open to allow the water to drain, or it is crushed with the instrument called a *mashdakh*, the image of which will appear with the images of other instruments in the following section.
Likewise, if the fetus has a large head, one should cut the skull or crush it with the *mashdakh*, as mentioned, then remove the bones with forceps. If the head comes out and is compressed at the collarbone, it should be cut to release the moisture in the chest.
Then the chest will contract.  If the chest does not contract and cannot be expelled, cut as much as you can.  If there is a swelling or lump in the lower abdomen, it should be incised so that the moisture flows out.
If the fetus is on its feet, pulling it out and aligning it to the opening of the uterus is easy. If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, it should be pulled with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be cut to allow the contents to flow out.
If all the other organs are removed and the head is retracted and stuck, let the midwife insert her left hand. If the opening of the uterus is open, insert the hand into the cervix, seek out the head, and pull it with the fingers toward the opening of the uterus.  Then insert a hook or two hooks and pull with them.
If the opening of the uterus has closed due to a hot, inflamed swelling, do not force it.  Instead, use applications of moist, fatty substances, apply dressings, and sit in relaxing, moist waters.
If the fetus is on its side, if it can be straightened, use the methods described for a living fetus. If this is not possible, cut it and remove it.  Absolutely nothing of the placenta should be left inside.  When finished treating, use the remedies mentioned for hot swellings that appear in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, she should sit in constricting waters and use other treatments.  I have witnessed a woman who conceived, the fetus died inside her, and subsequently conceived again.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a swelling appeared on her uterus, became inflamed, and started discharging pus.  I was called to treat her and treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close.  Then I applied some strong, drawing ointments.
A bone emerged from the area, and after a few days, another bone emerged.  I was astonished by this, as the abdomen does not contain bones.  I surmised that they were bones from the dead fetus.  I examined the wound and removed many bones from the fetal skull.
I continued this until I removed many bones, and the woman was in the best of health.  She lived for a long time, with a small amount of pus continuing to discharge from the area.  I have presented this unusual case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts to achieve through treatment by hand.
Chapter Seventy-seven.
It contains images of the instruments needed for removing the fetus.
Image of a spiral for opening the cervix.
This binder, with which books are bound, has two spirals at the ends of the wooden boards.  However, this spiral should be finer than the binder and made either of ebony or of boxwood.  The width of each board should be equal to two fingerbreadths.
Their edges should be about a finger's width, and their length one and a half spans.  In the middle of the boards are two pegs of the same wood, securely fastened to them, whose length is half a span or slightly more, and their width about two fingerbreadths or slightly more.  These two pegs.
They are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you turn the spirals.  An image of another instrument, similar to this but finer and lighter.
It is made of ebony or boxwood, shaped like tongs, but with two pegs at its tip, as you see. Each peg is about one span long and two fingerbreadths wide. If you wish to open the cervix with it...
Then have the woman sit on a bed, with her legs spread apart, and insert these two pegs, together, into the cervix.  You hold the end of the instrument underneath her between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with tongs, to whatever degree of opening you desire for the cervix. So that the midwife may do as she wishes.  A picture of another spiral mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument used to deliver the fetus.
Image of the instrument used to puncture the fetal head.
It resembles scissors, with teeth at the end, as you see.  It can also be made rectangular, like tongs, in this form, as you see. It has teeth like a saw's teeth, to cut and sever.
Image of another instrument.
Image of a hook.
This hook should have a little thickness so it doesn't break when pulling the fetus, an image of a two-pronged hook.
Image of two broad dissecting instruments for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more types there are and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his reputation with people.  So do not disdain any instrument; it may be needed.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In the removal of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, it is necessary to instruct the woman to hold herself, then to make her sneeze with a cupping glass, and to hold your hand over her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out this way, and if not, use a certain amount.
Pierce a hole in the cover, place in it herbs that open the cervix, such as fumitory, sow thistle, dill, chamomile, rue, and yarrow. Place all or some of these remedies in the hole, cover them with water, and place over the fire. Then, place a silver tube on the hole of the cover, with the other end in the cervix.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, and then make her sneeze, as we said. If the placenta comes out quickly, and if it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in the grease of the shrew or the saliva of the viper.
Then, she inserts it into the vagina and searches for the placenta. If she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out slowly, little by little. If it is attached deep within the uterus, insert the hand as described until the placenta is found, then gently pull it out slowly.
So that the uterus does not fall during forceful pulling, it is necessary to gently move it to the sides, right and left, and then increase the pulling force.  This will help it release from the adhesion. If the cervix is closed, the treatment with sneezing and the pot and herbs remedy was described previously.
If it does not come out despite all the methods described, avoid forceful pulling. Instead, tie what has been expelled to the woman's thigh near the cervix. Then, inject the four-ingredient ointment. It will cause decomposition after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out, but if it decomposes, a foul odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, harming the patient.  Therefore, the appropriate fumigation should be used.
Therefore, some early practitioners tried the smoke of incense and dried figs.  A depiction of the device used to fumigate a woman when menses or the placenta are retained, and similar situations.
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or made of copper. The narrow end is placed near the vagina, the wide end over the fire.  Incense is placed on the embers and held until it is gone, then replaced.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
For the treatment of the unperforated rectum.
Many boys may be born with an unperforated rectum, blocked by a thin membrane.  The midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger, or, failing that, puncture it with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to touch the muscle.
Then place cotton soaked in wine and oil on it and treat with ointments until healed.  If you fear that it will close again, place a lead tube in the opening for many days, removing it when the child wishes to defecate.
The rectum may also be blocked by a healed wound or tumor.  It is necessary to incise this blockage, and then treat it with the remedies previously mentioned, and with cauterization.
Chapter Eighty.
On treating warts that appear on the lower part of the body.
Warts that appear on the lower part of the body are a complication and thickening that occurs near the anus, externally, or within the space on one side. The wart may be one or more.
If this thickening persists, it may open and discharge watery, whitish fluid or thin pus. Some of these warts may penetrate the rectum and intestines.  Those that are not penetrating may be recognized by what is expelled in stool and flatulence when the patient uses the bathroom.
And sometimes worms may emerge from them.  Some warts, if located in the space, may penetrate the bladder and urethra, or penetrate the hip joint and coccyx.  A penetrating wart to the anus can also be identified from those that are not penetrating.
Insert your index finger into the anus and introduce a thin probe of brass or iron into the wart, if there is no winding path. If there is a winding path, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or the hair in your finger. If you feel nothing at all, and no stool, flatulence, or worms emerge from the opening, as we said, know that it is not penetrating, and proceed with treatment.
If the wart penetrates the bladder or urethra, the sign is the discharge of urine from it and the inability of the area to heal with medication.  If it penetrates the hip joint or coccyx, the sign is the probe reaching those locations.
If there is no winding path to the bone, and there is pain in a specific area, and pus constantly emerges from it, and treatment does not work and it does not heal with ointment, then none of these penetrating warts are likely to heal.
Treatment is a futile effort for those physicians who are ignorant of the matter.  However, for those warts that are not penetrating or chronic, healing is expected using iron, as I have described and tested.  Have the patient lie on their back before you.
Raise his legs upward, and tilt his thighs toward his abdomen. Then, insert the copper or lead probe into the wart, if there is a winding path, so you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe has pierced through your finger, uncovered, without feeling any skin or flesh between your finger and the probe, then know for certain that it is penetrating.  Do not tire yourself with it, for it will not heal, as we said.
They say that it heals in some people rarely.  A helpful treatment is to heat a thin cauterizing iron according to the size of the wart, as previously mentioned.  Insert it heated into the wart until it reaches near the anus, and then repeat this two or three times.
So you know that all the excess, clotted flesh resembling a bird's feather tube has been burned.  Then treat it with a cloth soaked in clarified butter until the burned flesh comes out.  Then treat it with healing ointments; if it heals.
Otherwise, it will not heal with any other treatment.  If you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh or membrane between the probe and your finger, and you see the wart is just below the skin surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the wart. While passing the incision with the probe in the wart, continue the incision until you reach where the probe tip ends, remove the probe, and let it fall. Then cleanse the clotted flesh, which resembles a bird's feather tube, until nothing remains.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If bleeding overwhelms you and prevents you from removing the flesh, the best and fastest remedy is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two beneficial results: burning the excess flesh.
And cut the blood and dry the moisture. Then treat it with a cloth soaked in clarified butter or crushed sulfur with oil until the area becomes suppurative and the burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that promote firm flesh growth.
These are the remedies that are astringent and drying.  If it is cured, it is healed and there is no need to return. If the wart has reached deep into the anus and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the anus and search with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it is a membrane or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then the only action is to attempt it with hope.  This means to use one of three methods: either to cauterize it, as we said.
Or to slit it until you reach its bottom so that you can use a cloth and treatment from close.  Do not make the slit too large, lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus, causing the patient to lose control of bowel movements.  Then treat it with the methods mentioned before.  Perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or, pierce through that membrane and puncture it after slitting it close to the anus, as we said, either with a probe or another sharp instrument. Then cleanse all the accumulated flesh in the slit to the extent possible.
Then close the entire wound, including the slit and the upper opening, until it heals.  The wart may remain open within the anus, which will be less troublesome for the patient.  The wart might be perforated in this manner.
If, when inserting the probe into the wart, it is on one side of the anus, towards the surface of the body, near the skin and the ring of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip, like a farrier's awl, in this way:
And insert a twisted thread of five threads or thereabouts into it. Then, insert the probe with the thread into the wart until it reaches its bottom.  If it is protruding into the edge of the anus from within, near the edge.
Then, remove the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and pulling out the end of the thread.  Bring together both ends and tie them firmly. Leave it for a day or two.  Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads breaks and falls away. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the wart is not protruding, make it protrude as best you can, but not if it is deep within, for you must not do this because of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then do to it as we described until it is cured.
The image of the pointed scalpel used to cut warts should have a very sharp curve on one side, and the other side should not be sharp, so as not to cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-One.
Concerning anal fissures that bleed and their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the anus, resembling red swellings or like grapes, and they come in small and large sizes, and blood constantly flows from them.
They may be single or multiple, and some are located outside the anus, at its edges. However, those outside the anus are usually less moist, dripping yellow water or a little blood continuously, and they are the color of the body.
The treatment for those inside the anus is to instruct the patient to defecate and strain until the anus protrudes and the polyps are visible to you.  Then quickly grasp and remove them with forceps or your fingernail, and cut them at their bases, if the forceps do not hold them due to their moisture and laxity.
Otherwise, grip it with a rough cloth or a piece of sharpened wood, or pull it out with your fingers, and then cut it.  Then, after the cut, sprinkle some sharp powders to act as cauterization, or cauterize it as previously described in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat it with further remedies until it heals.  If the anus does not protrude, inject the patient with an injection containing a little stinging substance to wash out what is in the anus and prompt its quick expulsion when the patient strains. As for the polyps outside the anus, their treatment is easy and straightforward.
It is to grasp it with your fingernail or forceps, cut it, and then treat it as described until it heals.  If one dislikes cutting with iron, then it is necessary to use a perforation in this manner: Take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the polyp upward and pierce it with the needle at its base from the other side, wrap the ends of the thread around the needle, which is positioned across it, and firmly tighten the polyp.  Then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the polyps, leaving one unpierced.
To cause the discharge of excess blood, then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or qirrooti on the anus and tell the patient to rest.  Then leave it until the polyps fall off.  If the polyps fall off, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they heal.
And as for the treatment of fissures, it often arises from dryness of the faeces and retention of the temperament.  If it persists and is not cured by medication, it is necessary to scrape it with a scalpel or with your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper layer of skin which prevents it from uniting is removed.
Then treat it until it forms a scab as is appropriate.  If it does not form a scab, repeat the scraping more forcefully than the first, until it bleeds profusely and is removed. Then treat it, and it will heal.

On the treatment of ingrown nails, both ingrown and non-ingrown, dry warts, and the pimple.
The ingrown nail is a rounded protuberance the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, which occurs throughout the body, particularly on the soles of the feet and fingers, and causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to cut around the nail, and to grasp it with a lancet or a hook and pull it out from its root. Then treat it.  Or, if you prefer, cauterize it as described in the relevant section.  As for dry warts, each is a small, rough, hardened, rounded protuberance on the surface of the body.
They frequently appear on children's hands.  Treatment involves stretching the wart, cutting it, or piercing it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off.  Or, if desired, cauterize it, as previously described, with fire or a sharp medicine.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts can be removed with the instrument I mentioned in the treatment of the pimple.  A pimple is also a small, hardened, thick protuberance on the body's surface, extending deep into it.  If cold affects it, it feels similar to a stinging sensation of ants.
It occurs throughout the body, most often on the hands.  Treatment involves taking a strong goose or eagle feather tube and placing it around the pimple, so that the tube encircles it completely.  Then rotate your hand with the tube until you rupture the skin around the pimple.
You place it deep into the flesh and the pimple is pulled out from its root.  Or, if you prefer, you do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube should be smooth and twisted, to allow easy gripping and twisting by the fingers. Or, if you prefer, cauterize the pimple, as previously described in the cauterization of warts.

In the forms of instruments used for injections in rectal ailments, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, or tin, or of hollowed or hammered copper.  Small and large sizes of this instrument can be made, according to the users' needs. Those used for treating young children, or those with narrow or painful rectums, should have very fine syringes.  Image of a large syringe:.
Its upper funnel, where the nozzle is attached, should be wide, with a partition where the nozzle is attached as shown.  The lower end, which enters the rectum, must be extremely smooth and polished, with two holes on one side and one hole on the other.
The size of the holes should be the thickness of a reed, or slightly thicker. The nozzle, into which the medicine is put, should be made of animal bladder or sheep's gut, shaped like a small spoon, with a diameter of one span.
It is pierced with many holes, as it is rotated, with the space between each hole being the thickness of a finger.  Then, a strong thread of doubled yarn, of ten threads or so, is inserted into these holes, collecting the nozzle like a spoon. If medicine is placed in it, tighten the top of the syringe between the stones firmly, then inject.  This is an image of the nozzle and holes.
The method of injection is to fill the gut or bladder with the medicine, while it is warm to the patient's tolerance.  Beware that it is not excessively hot or cold.  Then the patient lies on their back with their legs raised.
A mat or blanket is placed beneath.  Then the tip of the syringe is lubricated with ointment, egg white, or licorice juice, or similar.  Then it is gently inserted into the rectum.  The attendant holding the nozzle squeezes it firmly with both hands until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the bowels.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient lowers their legs against the wall. If the medicine is urging its way out, the patient should hold it back as much as possible. If the patient remains with it overnight, it is more effective in expelling it. If injected for cases of diarrhea and the expulsion is hastened, the injection should be repeated until healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, the syringe should be very gentle, smoother than the syringes used for children.  This is an image of a gentle syringe, its skin taut.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
On the treatment of surgical injuries.
I have previously discussed the treatment of injuries resembling burns in the classification.  Here I shall detail their treatment with hands and medications comprehensively.  I say that wounds differ according to the nature of the wound and the location of the injury.
The causes of wounds are numerous, such as a stone blow, a sword or knife cut, a spear or stick thrust, an arrow, and other similar things.
And as for wounds according to location on the body, such as wounds to the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and similar organs.
I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a standard and rule for all wounds.  I will begin with simple head wounds, specifically, as the complex ones will be discussed in the first chapter of the third book of this book.
So, if a simple wound occurs on the head, and it is not a bone fracture, I observe.  If it was caused by a stone blow or similar, and only the skin was damaged, and the wound is large and you fear the patient will develop a hot swelling, then promptly lance it with a lancet at that location. Do not delay this, and draw blood from him according to his strength, unless there is an impediment to bloodletting.  Especially if the blood coming from the wound is slight.  Let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinks, and heavy foods. If bloodletting is prevented, then reduce the patient's food intake, avoid meat and drinks.  If a hot swelling occurs, apply a cotton swab soaked in rose oil, alone or with a drink that has a constricting effect, to the wound.
If you fear a hot swelling, apply to the wound, if it is fresh and its blood has not been altered by the air (the specific type of air I will describe to you shortly), a compress. However, if the air has altered it, apply some ointments.
Until the pus comes out, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large, and caused by a sword or similar weapon, and its edges do not meet naturally, join them together with stitches, as described in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin has been peeled back from the bone, and is only attached by a small flap, then cut it off.  Then treat the wound with medications that will form strong flesh in place of the skin.  Instruct the patient to eat foods that provide strength, such as heads and viscera.
If the skin develops gangrene, and it is not attached to the bone, cut off all the gangrenous tissue and dispose of it. Then treat the wound. If, in these wounds, an artery or vein is bleeding, and the bleeding cannot be stopped with medications, locate the artery.
If you hit it, and it does not stop bleeding, cut it with a scalpel and tie it off.  If necessary, and the aforementioned treatments are ineffective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, their treatment is easy and simple; they can be treated by simply sprinkling this powder (dhurur) onto them while they are still bleeding.
Before the air changes it, the recipe for the dhurur is: one part frankincense, two parts cinnamon, and three parts slaked or unslaked lime.  Grind all of these together, sift, and pack the wound with it.  Bind tightly so it adheres well.
It will coagulate with the blood, then apply bandages on top. Leave it undisturbed as long as it does not swell.  The medicine will not be removed until it heals.  The lime alone may achieve this, if frankincense and cinnamon are not available.
This same action can also be done in many large wounds, if its application is skillful and they are bound tightly.  This is the case with wounds that are fresh and still bleeding, provided the air hasn't altered them. However, if the air has changed them somewhat, especially if it is during the summer.
Therefore, there is no use in applying this dhurur.  Instead, treat it as described previously: apply some ripening ointment or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until the pus is released, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
However, if the wound involves a minor fracture of the bone, pull it with the jift.  The treatment of head fractures is discussed in the section on neck injuries.  If the wound is in the neck, there is no difference in treatment from a simple head wound.
If a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it's a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treatments that constrict too tightly, such as alum, vitriol, and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause spasms.
Absolutely nothing cold should be applied to the wound, because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  Instead, use gentle remedies like moistened rose water or rose oil and ceruse, which have been repeatedly washed with fresh water.
If also washed with fresh water, and other minerals in this manner, and moist ointments.  If the wound is large, use sutures or bring the edges together with strips, and then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a cavity and pus has collected at the bottom, drain it at the lowest point.  If an artery has been severed in the wound and you see blood flowing, tie it off or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilage of the throat, but the veins are intact, bring the edges of the skin together with sutures along the cartilage of the throat.  Do not touch the throat itself, but smooth it and restore it to its natural shape, then tie it firmly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have a binding and drying effect until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, explore it. If there are fragments of bone, remove as many as possible.  If not all can be removed, leave it until the wound becomes necrotic and heals, making removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the powder we described.  If bone in the wound becomes necrotic and forms a fistula, treat it as described in the section on chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see a cavity, look to see if the patient exhales wind when breathing.  If so, know that it is a fatal wound. If there is no cavity and it is fresh with blood, do not immediately apply the powder nor tighten it, lest the blood be trapped in the cavity.
For it will recede to the heart and kill the patient.  Instead, apply a drawing ointment, twice daily.  If you do not have ointment, place a piece of old cloth in the wound to absorb the moisture.  Place the patient on their back, with the wound facing up.
To drain what collects there. If three days or more have passed since the wound was inflicted and the patient shows no spasm, no bad palpitations, and no shortness of breath, and you find their other conditions good, know that the wound is healthy. Treat it with bandages and other therapies until healed.
If it is difficult to see and the wound is continuously discharging, know that it has become a fistula. Treat it according to its appropriate section. The patient should lie on the wound to drain what collects in it.  If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it with the sutures described previously.
If it is large, or if it is small and has been treated with powder, if it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, probe the wound and promptly remove the fragments if they are loose. If they are not loose, leave them until...
The wound will fester, and then it will be easier to remove them.  As for the other wounds that occur in the various organs, their treatment is the same as what we have described.
Eighty-fifth Chapter.
On wounds of the abdomen, and the expulsion and suturing of the intestines.
A wound that appears in the abdomen may be large, small, or medium. A large wound may cause the expulsion of one or several intestines, making their return and suturing more difficult and arduous.
A small wound, too, may present difficulties in another way, making the return of the intestines more arduous. If the intestines are not returned to their proper place immediately, they swell and thicken, making their return difficult.  Therefore, the best type of wound is the medium-sized wound, because returning the intestines is not as difficult as it is with these other two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is done in four ways. Two sutures are general-purpose, suitable for suturing the abdomen and other bodily wounds. The other two sutures are specialized, applicable to all wounds, but are more specifically used for suturing the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation. I say, if the wound is small and something of the intestines has come out and its return is difficult, then this is due to one of two reasons: either the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestines have experienced inflation from the cold of the air.
If this is the case, it is necessary to warm it by dipping a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water, alone, or that has been cooked in it with the plants known as iḍḵar, saʿdī, and sanbal, and apply it to the intestines to dissolve the swelling.
A drink that has a binding quality may also be used, which is better than water alone in resolving the swelling. If you see that the swelling has been dissolved, moisten the intestines with water that has been cooked with the plant called ḫaṭmi or ḵabbāzī, for this will facilitate their return with ease.
If its return is still impossible after this treatment, then make a small incision in the wound using the instrument used for lancing boils. The initial treatment is preferable to incision, and incision is only resorted to when necessary and all other methods have failed. This is a depiction of the instrument.
Its one curved side is limited, while the other is unlimited. The thin end is not as thin as the scalpel's, but is slightly blunt. It is a small, dagger-like instrument, as you see. If the wound is wide and the intestines have entered, then it is necessary for their return to be to their natural shape.
Its specific location, if achievable, is best. However, if the wound is wide and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs elevated higher than their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, then the head and chest should be elevated higher than the lower part of the body.
Likewise, if the wound is in one side of the abdomen, always aim to keep the side with the incision higher than the other side. This method should be used in major as well as moderate surgeries.
For minor surgeries, position it as best as you can. Then, have a helpful assistant hold the entire wound in their hands, bringing the edges together, and gradually exposing it to the surgeon for stitching.
This is the general method for single-stitch closure: Take a needle or several needles, proportionate to the wound's size. Then, leave a space equal to the thickness of the little finger on either side of the wound, and insert one needle without thread into the edges of the skin. With the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin, from the inside, so that you pierce it from that side. The edges of the skin and the peritoneum have now joined, forming four layers. Then, pull the double thread around the needle several times on both sides, bringing the edges of the wound together firmly.
Then leave another space equal to the thickness of a finger and insert another needle. Then, thread it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue this process with as many needles as necessary until you have closed the entire wound.  The needles should be of medium thickness.
Because very thin needles readily cut through the flesh, and thick needles are difficult to insert into the skin, the needles should be of medium thickness.  One should not insert the needle into the edge of the skin too deeply.
So that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound reopens before healing.  Also, do not space the stitches too far apart, so that the wound cannot heal.  Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient while sleeping, and prepare for them a linen covering on each side to hold the needle ends.
Leave them until you know that the wound has healed.  This type of stitching with needles is best for small surgeries, because one or two needles may suffice for the stitching.
As for the method of stitching for the common person, it is to gather the four edges—namely, the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum—at once with a needle that has a thread of moderate thickness and thinness.  Then, after the needle has passed through all four edges, return the needle from the same side from which it began.
So that the thread is interwoven from above the wound, to make the stitches like the stitches used to secure bags.  Leave the space between each stitch the width of a little finger.  This type of stitching is known by everyone.
With this stitching, a surgeon treated a man who had a knife wound in his abdomen. The wound was more than a span in length and approximately two spans of the small intestine had protruded. The wound was located in the middle of the abdomen.
After the intestines protruded from the wound for twenty-four hours, he returned them. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and he was treated until he recovered. He lived many years afterward, managing all his affairs.  Physicians had pronounced that he would never recover.
Surprisingly, I did not treat it with ointment, because I was in a place where there were no medications available.  I placed worn cotton on the wound twice a day and moistened it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the special types of stitching, I mention it according to Galen's text: Begin the stitching from the skin, inserting the needle from the outside to the inside.  Once the needle pierces the skin and the muscle running along the entire length of the abdomen.
Leave the peritoneum edge on the side where you inserted the needle.  Then, insert the needle into the other edge of the peritoneum from inside to outside.  Once you have pierced it, pierce it again in this same peritoneum edge from outside to inside.
Leave the peritoneum edge on this side and insert the needle into the other edge from inside to outside.  At the same time as inserting it into the peritoneum, insert it into the peritoneum edge on its side, until it pierces all of it.
Then, begin again from this same side and line it up with the peritoneum edge on the other side. Bring the needle out of the skin near it, then return it to that skin and line up the peritoneum edge on the other side with this edge of the peritoneum.
Bring it out of the skin on its side, and do this again and again until you sew the entire wound in that manner.  In summary, the characteristics of this stitch are that of a furrier's stitching for fur.
By sewing the peritoneum once from one side with the skin edge, and leaving it once from the other side until it is finished; and as for the second type of specific suture that Galen also mentioned, this is his account verbatim.
It is that you sew it in the manner that some healers stitch it, by bringing each part to its matching counterpart, naturally; so they bring the peritoneum edge to its other edge, and the peritoneum edge to its other edge, in the manner I describe to you.
The needle should be inserted into the peritoneum edge nearest to you, from the outside, and penetrate it to the inside, alone; and leave the peritoneum edges. Then return the needle and penetrate it from the outside to the inside of both peritoneum edges, then return it again.
And penetrate it from the inside to the outside in the other peritoneum edge on the opposite side.  This type of suture is better than the common, simple suture previously mentioned. This is Galen's account verbatim. Some have said that a suture of the abdomen may be possible with two needles. That is, inserting a single thread, beginning by inserting the needle from your side, and penetrating it to the other side; and inserting the other needle from the opposite side, penetrating it to your side, according to the way the leatherworkers sew.
Know that if the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, its suture is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.  As for the treatment of the wound, its treatment is the same as other wounds. That is, if you encounter the wound fresh with its blood before the air alters it, and return the intestines to their position and stitch them firmly, then apply the healing poultice to it.
If the wound has been altered by the air, apply some ointments that are available to you until it suppurates and the stitches fall out, and the peritoneum and peritoneum are joined together.  Then treat it like any other wound until it heals.
If you do not have any medicines available, apply to it from the beginning of suppuration, old cotton wool, and replace it twice a day as I instructed you until it heals.  You will not need further treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple, but if you fear that the wound may involve the major organs in pain.
Therefore, it is necessary to dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpits.  If he feels pain or foul smell in his intestines, this often occurs, then irrigate him with a lukewarm, black astringent drink.
Especially if the foul odor has reached the intestines and become a penetrating wound into its interior. Know that intestines which are thick are easier to heal, and those which are thin are more difficult to heal.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it will not heal at all from surgery occurring therein, due to the multitude and size of its blood vessels and the thinness of its substance and its proximity to the nerve's nature.  If the protrusion from the wound is a small portion and you grasp it promptly, return it in the same way you would return the intestine.
If a significant amount of time has passed and it has turned green or black, then you should tie it off with a thread above the blackened area, lest blood flow occur, for there are blood vessels and arteries in the protrusion.  Then cut what lies below that ligature.
And you shall leave the ends of the thread hanging from beneath the wound, outside it, so it is easy to pull and remove it when the protrusion falls and the wound suppurates.  The wound which occurs in the intestine has been described.  Now, if a perforation occurs in the intestine and it is small...
For in some people, it may be possible to heal it, for I have seen a person who had been wounded in the abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach.  The wound festered and became a fistula, from which feces and gas escaped. I treated it, though I did not hope for a cure. I continued to treat it until it healed and the area closed.  When I saw that the area had closed, I feared that the patient might experience some bad event in his belly.  However, he suffered no such mishap whatsoever and remained in the best of health. Indeed, he ate, drank, engaged in sexual intercourse, bathed, and exercised in his service.  Some experienced individuals have stated that if a wound occurs in the intestine and is small, it should be treated in this manner.
To do this, large, headed ants are taken, and then the edges of the wound are brought together.  An ant, with its mouth open, is placed on the edges of the wound.  When it grasps and closes its mouth, its head is cut off; then it will adhere and not separate.  Then another ant is placed near the first.
Continue doing this with several ants, according to the size of the wound.  Then, suture the wound.  These heads remain adhering to the intestines until the intestines heal and are cured.  No ailment occurs in the patient.  The intestines can also be sutured with thin thread.
To extract the animal adhesive from the Egyptian animal's adhesive, after having inserted it into a needle, one must take the end of this thread from the Egyptian animal's adhesive and extract it.  Then, a thin, spun linen thread is tied to its end, and this thread is then inserted into the needle. The Egyptian animal's thread is used to suture the intestines, then returned to the abdomen.  This type of suturing with ants and the Egyptian animal's adhesive is done with hope and expectation.
However, if the tear is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy, and no cure is possible.
Chapter Eighty-six.
On the treatment of colds and catarrh.
Know that any wound or swelling that becomes chronic, longstanding, and ulcerated, and continually discharges pus without ceasing, is called, in general terms, regardless of the affected part, a "nasus" or "cold.
It is, in fact, a hardened, dense, white mass without pain, having a cavity like that of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some called it a "feather."  Sometimes it is moist, continually discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture might stop. This moisture can be abundant, sparse, thick, or thin.
I have previously stated in the classification of surgical conditions that any ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow is due to one of nine causes, one of which is either a lack of blood in the body, or its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside the ulcer or on its edges that prevents the growth of healthy flesh. Or because it is excessively harmful and dirty, or because the ulcer itself is foul and the material discharging from it is of poor quality, or because the treatment is inappropriate, or because of a widespread disease affecting the region, or because of a specific local condition.
Or because it is excessively harmful and dirty, or because the ulcer itself is foul and the material discharging from it is of poor quality, or because the treatment is inappropriate, or because of a widespread disease affecting the region, or because of a specific local condition. As observed in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is slow by nature, or because it contains a single bone or several bones.  I have described all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medications in the classification.
Here, I must inform you about the treatment of nasal polyps and colds that can be treated manually.  Know that nasal polyps can occur in all parts of the body, some of which lead to large vessels, arteries, or nerves.
or to the peritoneum, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of complex structures like the hand and foot, and some lead to proximity to a major organ or similar.
Therefore, those polyps that exhibit these characteristics are among the difficult-to-heal diseases that do not accept treatment, and dealing with them is a burden and a cause for ignorance.  If there are polyps that have not reached these locations I mentioned, I hoped for and anticipated their treatment.
If you wish to ascertain this, take a probe of copper or iron. If the polyp is straight, probe it with that. If the polyp has a curve, probe it with a thin lead probe, as lead is pliable.
If the probe enters and turns towards the curve, if the polyp has many openings that you cannot identify with the probe, inject one opening with moisture, then the moisture will flow towards the other openings and drain out.
Then thoroughly investigate in any way possible to determine if there is bone or nerve, whether the polyp's base is far or near, or whether it is a single polyp with multiple openings.  Ascertain all of this to the best of your ability through careful examination, and consider the pain when you touch the area.
And similar to this are the signs and causes of the tumor. If you have determined all of this accurately, then proceed to treatment with confidence, and consider this: if...
If the polyp is visible, near the surface, or in a healthy location distant from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the locations previously mentioned, then cut the polyp as described, and remove any accumulated hardened tissue, rotten flesh, or excess flesh from within.
And treat any flesh or warts that grow in its mouth, until it heals. If the polyp is deep-seated and located on a straight line, you should cut it deeply as possible and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Then use a twisted, medicated thread soaked in potent medicines and insert it into the base of the polyp, which you can locate with the surgical instrument. Repeat this several times until the potent medicine consumes any remaining corruption in the base of the polyp.
Then apply ointments that promote healthy tissue growth until it heals. If it does not heal with this, cauterize it as described before.  If the cause of the polyp is bone, and you are sure of this, investigate and cut it as I previously instructed, unless prevented by something.
If the cause is a vein, nerve, or a principal organ, as we said. If the bone is exposed and has some corruption and blackness, remove the corruption until it is gone, and then treat it with a method that promotes healing until it heals. If it does not heal, and the pus persists as it had been.
Know that you have not reached complete removal of the corruption.  Expose everything affected again, and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with all your effort. Then apply the healing treatment. If it heals, well and good.  If not, know that this corruption lies deep within the diseased area.  Expose all affected areas again.
Thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with all your effort. If the corrupted bone is small and you can pull it out, pull it out with the fine forceps suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, thoroughly remove them all; leave nothing.  If any ligaments are obstructing them, and cutting them would not be dangerous, cut those ligaments and any surrounding flesh, and free the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones right away, apply something to fester the wound. Leave it for days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones have festered. Keep the wound open; do not allow the opening you created during your work to close.
Instead, if you fear that, apply a cotton ball soaked in powdered sulfur mixed with oil, or a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments.  When those ligaments fester and the bones loosen, they will be easy to remove and extract.
If it is a single large bone, like a leg bone or thigh bone, and only its surface is corrupted, thoroughly scrape it until the blackness and corruption disappear, then close the wound.  If a large portion is corrupted and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, it must be spread open.
Cut it completely to where the corruption ends.  Then treat it until it heals.  I am telling you about a case of illness that happened to a man in his leg, to make it an example and help in your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years had passed; he had pain in his leg, originating from movement inside the body, until materials reached the leg and a large swelling developed. There was no cause from the outside. Then time passed, along with the mistakes of the physicians, until the swelling opened.
A large amount of material flowed from it, and he was poorly treated until the leg festered, and many openings appeared, all emitting pus and bodily fluids.  A group of physicians treated him for about two years, but none of them were skilled surgeons.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg, with a large flow of material pouring from those openings. The man's body was wasted, and his color was yellow. I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
I found that some of them connected to each other from all sides of the leg.  I then incised one of those openings, until I exposed some of the bone. I found it corrupted, gnawed, blackened, putrid, and perforated, until the perforation reached the marrow.  I reported what I had discovered.
I extracted the corrupted bone, and I believe that there was no corruption in the bone other than what I had removed and exposed. I then used healing drugs to try and close the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.  I then exposed the bone again, beyond the previous exposure.
I found the corruption connected to the bone. I then exposed what I had found of that corruption. I tried to close it but it did not heal or close.  I then exposed it again.  I continued to cut the bone piece by piece, attempting to close it, but it would not heal until I had removed about a span of bone.
I removed it along with its marrow, then closed it with medicines.  It healed quickly and recovered.  This repetition of work and cutting was necessary because of the patient's weakness, their poor tolerance, and my fear of their death, since they had suffered frequent fainting spells due to excessive vomiting.  They recovered completely.
Firm flesh grew in place of the bone, and their condition improved.  Their strength returned, and they regained their normal activities.  They suffered no impairment in their walking.  If a bone that had broken had grown in that location.
Therefore, it is necessary to expose it in this manner: Take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone. Have someone pull it upwards.  Use another bandage of thicker wool than the first.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull the end of the bandage to pull the flesh downwards.  As you expose the flesh in the area you want to expose, to prevent the saw from injuring the flesh.  Place a piece of wood or plank beneath the bone securely from below.
Because if you do that, the saw will not hesitate to cut the corrupted bone.  The exposure should be slightly above the corrupted area so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone, so it does not appear superficially to the sense, and you will not be forced to expose it again.
If the bone is corrupted, but not protruding, and its parts are joined together, and the corruption is in its center or in a part of it, then expose the flesh from all sides, place the plank underneath, and then expose it from the first side where the corruption is.
When you have finished exposing it, expose it from the other side.  Let the exposure be a little distance from the corruption, as we said.  If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and expose the bone where it joins from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but removal. If the corruption is in the finger bones of the hand or foot, the treatment is very difficult.  However, you must scrape away the corruption however it appears, remove it, and clean it in any way you can.
By any means possible, as long as you are not obstructed by a vein or nerve.  Know that there are many saws and chisels for cutting these bones, depending on the position, shape, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and fragility of the bones. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a tool appropriate to each type of work.
Know that the work itself may indicate the type of tool you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of this craft, for the master of the craft, who has seen many types of illnesses. He may invent tools similar to each disease, and I have illustrated for you in the end of this chapter various tools.
Make them examples to follow and use them as a comparison for others, God willing.  Image of a saw.

Chapter Seventy-eight.
In cutting off limbs and spreading the bones.
The limbs may decay either from an external cause or from an internal one. If you treat this decay with medicinal remedies, and the treatment is ineffective, and you see the decay spreading within the limb, nothing will restrain it.
Therefore, you should cut off that limb where the decay has reached, so that the afflicted person may be saved from death or a great calamity, which is greater than the loss of the limb.  A sign that this has happened is that the limb will turn black, as if fire has burned it.
Or it may decay after turning black, until that decay spreads to the limb adjacent and takes hold of the entire body.  So hasten to cut it off.  Likewise, if the cause of decay is from the sting of some venomous creature, like the sea scorpion, snake, or centipede, and the like.
If the decay or the sting is in the tip of the finger, cut off the finger, and do not delay the decay from spreading to the hand. Likewise, if it has taken hold of the hand, cut it off at the base of the forearm, and do not delay the decay from spreading until it affects the arm's forearm.
Likewise, if it has taken hold of the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow, at the joint itself.  If the decay spreads and you see it affecting the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder at all, for that would mean the patient's death. Use other treatment, to the best of your ability.
Likewise, do the same for the leg. If the decay affects the toe, cut off the toe at one of the phalanges. If it affects the foot, cut off the entire leg. If it ascends to the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it and allow the patient to succumb to death. The method for cutting or dissecting a limb is to tie a bandage at the lower part of the place you want to cut and tie another bandage above the place.
One attendant stretches the lower bandage downward, and another stretches the upper bandage upward. You yourself, using a wide scalpel, expose all the flesh between the bandages. Then cut or dissect.  You should place linen cloths on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the correct location and cause the patient excessive pain and a hot swelling.  If bleeding occurs during your work, quickly cauterize the area or apply some hemostatic agent, then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Then bandage the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals.  I tell you of a similar case that occurred to a man on his leg:  a blackening accompanied by a burning sensation like fire.
This decay first appeared on his finger, and eventually affected the entire limb.  The man, experiencing severe pain and burning, cut off the affected limb at the joint, and recovered.
After a long time, the same decay reappeared on his index finger.  He came to me, and I applied remedies to his hand, after cleaning his body.  The decay did not stop, and continued to spread to the other finger.
The decay spread to the entire hand, and he asked me to amputate it.  I refused, hoping to stop the decay, and fearing that amputation would lead to death since the man was close to death.  When he despaired of me, he returned to his own country.
I was later informed that he eventually amputated his entire hand and recovered.  I have related this story to assist in cases of similar disease and to provide a model for treatment.
Eighty-eighth Chapter.
In treating abscesses and how to inject medicines into them.
If a tumor develops in some fleshy organ and its duration continues until it accumulates pus, then bursts or breaks open and releases all the accumulated pus, leaving the area empty as if it were a vessel.
The skin over it, like a torn cloth, has become thin, and the damage was not severe enough to affect the bone, nerve, or ligament.  Therefore, it deserves to be called an abscess, and not a fistula, unless its duration extends so that the corruption affects one of these organs.
In that case, it is called a fistula or ulcer, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin, as it circles around, especially if it has become thin and like a rag, and you are certain that it does not adhere to the area due to its corruption.
If you hope that the skin will adhere and the corruption has not reached that extent, and there is thick flesh in the skin, then treat it by injection.  Look at the abscess; if it is large and the pus it emits has a foul odor, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and copperas in equal parts collected in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens and reaches the consistency of honey. Then take what you need of it, thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess, compress its opening, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then remove it by pressing. Do this for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.  You can also inject it with ash water if you don't have this medicine.  This is done by taking the ash of grapevine wood or oak wood and pouring water over it.
Then filter it and inject it until you are certain that the abscess has been washed clean. If the patient is not responding to Egyptian medicine or ash water, inject it with water and honey mixed with some ground copperas.
Or inject it with honey and drink mixed together, because honey cleanses and washes, and the drink adheres to the abscess, especially if the drink has a quality of tightening and drying.  If you do this repeatedly and are certain that the abscess's corruption is gone, inject it with something to promote flesh growth.
For example, take some of the palm ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and a astringent drink, or inject it with some of the other medications and ointments whose properties we have described in the article on ointments.  If the abscess opening is narrow and does not allow the injection tube to fit,
Then widen it slightly with iron, or place a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or sirkon ointment inside to make it wider.  Likewise, if the opening is wide, stitch its edges together, leaving only enough space for the injection tube to enter without extra room.
Also, if its opening, from which pus is dripping, is elevated, make a cut at the lowest point so that the pus drains downwards, because if the pus is retained in the depths of the abscess, it prevents the flesh from growing there.
If you cannot cut the abscess towards the bottom as desired, then consider positioning the limb so that the pus drains easily, as best you can, and to ensure that no pus is retained at all.
As for the adhesive medications to be applied to the abscess from the outside and how to apply them: take one of the adhesive ointments suitable for your needs, spread it on a linen cloth, making the cloth large enough to cover the entire abscess. Then, with scissors, cut an opening slightly larger than the abscess's opening opposite the mouth of the abscess.  Then, spread a soft ointment on another cloth sized to fit the opening, placing it over the opening, keeping it a distance from the mouth of the abscess to allow easy drainage. Do not remove the larger cloth until later.
For several days.  As for the one on the abscess's opening, it is the one to remove at all times to allow the accumulated pus to drain.  So you can determine whether the pus draining is a lot or a little, or ripe or not ripe.
And also, check the abscess itself: does the patient feel pain there, or not? Is there swelling, or not?  If you continue treatment this way and see that the material coming out from the abscess opening is little.
Know then that the abscess has adhered or is close to adhering.  In that case, treat it again tomorrow or on the third day.  When you have treated the wound, replace the cloths and renew the ointment. If after a long time, thin pus comes out of the abscess, do not despair of its adhesion.
For its healing is near, because some people have slow tissue growth in their wounds, while others have rapid growth. If pus that is not ripe comes from the abscess after many days, know that the abscess has not adhered. If the abscess adhesion is delayed.
Then increase the drying medication.  Let the medications be moist in texture and dry in strength, like a Palestinian ointment, if more colocynth has been added.  The most effective treatment is using Palestinian ointment.
It is treated by applying rose oil and sprinkling with moderate, viscous, old wine, then mixing it with the wine and applying it.  A similar action can be taken if Palestinian ointment is not available.  Honey, if boiled until it thickens, may be used or you can take extracts of mastic, frankincense and kender, grind them all, and sprinkle them on honey over heat. Then apply it to a cloth and bandage it to the abscess, or apply the boiled, thickened honey, sprinkle the herbs on it, and bandage it with cloth.
In such cases, long-stalked zeraun, the root of the asmanjūn lily, kresna flour, and rue, either alone or mixed together, are ground, sifted, and sprinkled onto the described honey, and then applied.  If the abscess persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption within it.
If it has affected the bones, or other hard tissues or ligaments, treat it with the treatment of fistula as previously described.
Eighty-ninth Chapter.
On the treatment of the inflamed finger, the injured fingernail, the amputation of superfluous fingers, and the separation of fused fingers.
Daḥs is excess flesh that grows beneath the fingernail of the hand or foot, and possibly on other fingers.  If it persists and treatment is neglected, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it may corrupt and fester, even consuming the base of the nail, and possibly destroying it entirely.  The corruption may even reach the bone, producing a foul odor, widening the fingertip, and making it dark-colored.  If you treat it as described in the section and your treatment is ineffective,
then you should cut with an instrument all the excess growth from the nail, and subsequently cauterize the wound.  Cauterization is very effective in this case.  But if the bone is intact and the nail as well,
and if the nail's edge has pressed the flesh inward, causing it to be pierced and irritated, then you should place a thin strip of material under the edge of the nail that is piercing the flesh, and lift it upward, and carefully cut away that flesh.
and apply to the remaining flesh the corrosive, burning medicines until it all disappears, then treat it with ointments until it heals.  But if the corruption has affected the bone, then it is necessary to cut away and remove that bone, for it will not heal at all while there is diseased bone present.
If you see decay and corruption spreading in the finger, amputate it at one of the phalanges, as previously mentioned, and then treat it until it heals.  If the nail is struck or wounded, and severe pain develops, you should first lance the afflicted area.
Then split the nail with a sharp scalpel, making an oblique split from top to bottom, and be careful not to reach the flesh beneath the nail with the split, for that would cause the afflicted area intense pain and become a cause for excess flesh to grow in that spot. Then treat the area with whatever relieves the pain.
As for the extra finger that develops in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or some of it may be bone, or it may have a nail. Some of it may grow from the root of a joint of some of the fingers.
Or it may grow on some of the finger's phalanges.  Those that grow on some of the finger's phalanges do not move; those that grow at the finger joint may move.  If it is purely fleshy, cutting it is easy.  Cut it at its root with a wide scalpel.
However, if it grows from the joint's origin, treating it is difficult.  Avoid cutting it.  If it grows on the finger at one of the phalanges, first cut the flesh in a circular motion towards the bone, then expose the bone using one of the appropriate chisels for that.
Then treat it until it heals.  As for the adhesion that sometimes occurs between fingers, it frequently happens, either present at birth or arising from a healed wound, burn, or similar injury.  It is necessary to split that adhesion.
So that the fingers return to their natural position.  Then place between them a compress or a small opening soaked in rose oil, to prevent rapid adhesion, and separate them, or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the area heals properly.
Likewise, if adhesion occurs between a finger and the palm, split that adhesion according to what seems appropriate and beneficial for the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On cutting the ligatures.
Ligatures are twisted, thick veins filled with black, viscous fluid that occur in most parts of the body, but are most common in the legs, especially in the legs of those who wear tight shoes, carriers, and porters.  First, it is necessary to use vigorous rubbing of the body to remove the black fluid repeatedly.
Then, lance the affected area with a lancet.  Treatment with iron comes in two forms: one in which the vein is split and the black blood is removed; the other in which the vein is cut completely and all the fluid is removed.  As for the splitting, first, soak the leg in warm water.
Until the thick, murky blood dissolves.  Then, wrap the patient's leg from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage.  Then split the vein in one, two, or three wide incisions.
Then, drain the black blood from the lower part of the leg to the top, and from the top to the bottom, until you have removed an amount of blood you deem sufficient or what the patient's strength allows.  Then, tie it off and instruct the patient to avoid foods that generate black fluid.  Repeat the emesis and phlebotomy.
When the veins become filled and this harms the patient, as for cutting them, it should be done in this way: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair, then take them to the bath and soak the leg in hot water until it turns red and sweats, or they undergo strenuous exercise.
If a bath is not available to warm the limb, then cut the skin along the vein, either near the knee or below at the heel.  Then, open the skin with hooks and pull the vein from all sides until it is visible.
Upon its appearance, you will see it is red and taut.  Once freed from the skin, it also appears like a tendon. Then, insert a probe beneath it until it rises and comes out from the skin.  Fasten it with a smooth, blunt hook. Then, make another incision close to that first incision, about the width of three fingers.
Then, peel the skin away from the vein until it is exposed.  Then, lift it with the probe as you did before and secure it with another hook, as you did initially.  Then, make another incision, or several incisions if necessary.
Then, cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, pull and dissect it until it emerges from the second incision.  Then, pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it through the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, until all of it is out.  Then, cut it.
If pulling and dissecting do not work, insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread, tie it, and pull. Insert the probe underneath and twist your hand in every direction until it comes out, ensuring the thread does not break. If it breaks, dissecting will be very difficult.
This can cause harm to the patient.  Once you have dissected it completely, apply wool soaked in a drink and rose oil or oil to the wound site and treat it until it heals. If the varicose vein is twisted and has bends with turns in different directions...
If it is not straight, as we said, it is necessary to incise it at every bend and twisting point. Then, suspend it with hooks until you dissect it completely. Be careful when incising it not to cut or injure the vein, as this will make dissecting it difficult, so conserve your effort.
Image of the incision used for varicose veins.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not have a bend like other hooks, nor should the tip be sharp to avoid injuring the vein.  It should be thick and smooth in its bend, because if it is thin, its thinness will cut the vein. Instead, it should have the advantage of thickness, as we said.
Chapter Ninety-one.
In the case of a superficial vein.
This vein originates in the legs in hot countries like al-Hijaz and the Arab lands, and in hot, sparsely populated countries. It may also originate in other parts of the body besides the legs, arising from an infection occurring beneath the skin.
As it occurs within the bodies of snakes and worms, and abscesses and the worms that develop between the skin and flesh, and a sign of the beginning of this vein's formation is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the area swells, and then the vein begins to emerge from the site of the swelling.
As if it were the root of a plant or an animal, and once its tip appears, a small piece of lead weighing one to two dirhams should be wrapped around it, tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it outward, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it grows too much, cut off some of it and wrap the remainder, but do not cut it from its origin until all of it emerges, because if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing a tumor, an infection, and a foul ulcer in the area.
Therefore, it should be gradually treated and pulled little by little until it emerges completely from its end and nothing of it remains in the body. In some people, this vein may emerge five or ten cubits long.
I have heard that it has emerged from a man twenty cubits long. If it breaks during your treatment, insert a reed into its opening, and press it tightly against the body for a long time until all the matter within it is emptied. Then try to heal the area with medicines for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors.  This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or the leg itself, producing numerous openings and a branch emerging from each opening. Treat it as described in the section and as previously mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-two.
Concerning the abscess on the worm produced beneath the tendon, and called the "cattle disease.
This disease is called "cattle disease" in some of our countries, because it often affects cattle. It is a single small worm that develops between the skin and flesh and crawls throughout the body, both upwards and downwards.
It is perceptible to the touch as it crawls from one limb to another, until it pierces the skin in a place, emerges, and forms from the putrefaction of certain humours, as occurs with worms, snakes, and the "gourd fever" in the abdomen.
Its danger lies in its ability to crawl within the body and ascend to the head, reaching the eye, potentially causing it to rupture and exit, thus damaging the eye. This is a common occurrence.  Therefore, if one seeks to treat and remove it, it must be done when it is crawling and perceptible to the touch.
Therefore, it is necessary to bind firmly above and below the worm with a strong bandage, then to incise it and remove it.  If it has burrowed into the flesh and cannot be found, then apply cautery with fire to the area until it is burned.  The greatest danger is its potential to damage the eye, as we have mentioned.
If you see it has reached the head near the eye, bind firmly below it on the forehead, then incise and remove it.  The patient should maintain the cleansing of his body with laxatives for the putrid and bad humours, and should avoid foods that generate putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-three.
On the incision of the disease known as the "naفر".
This disease, called the "naفر" in our country, is a pain that appears in some members, then spreads from one member to another. I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was summoned to a woman in distress in one of the deserts.  She uncovered her arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the vein of the arm.  After an hour, I saw that swelling travel up the forearm, like a worm ascending to her shoulder as quickly as mercury.
If it travels from one place to another, the pain subsides from that location and settles in the shoulder.  Then, after an hour, it spread throughout the rest of the body, even to the other arm.  She recounted that it seemed to circulate her entire body, as I observed.
I was amazed by the speed of its transfer from one limb to another.  Before this, I had only heard of this disease affecting different parts of the body, but I had not personally witnessed it in such a manner as I did with this woman.
I surmised that this was because the woman was a desert dweller, with a lean body and exposed veins.  This is why this moving sensation was perceptible.  It should not appear in this manner in those of affluent society with soft bodies, hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it, and the afflicted person feels the pain visibly as described, then tightly bind above and below it with haste, and lance it until the accumulated wind/malignancy is expelled.
If you do not see it with your own eyes, treat it by shaking the body and dispersing the winds, such as the stink bean and the scabieous bean, and similar remedies.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
In the extraction of arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and the locations in the body where they lodge.  Differences in type include large and small arrows, hollow and solid glass arrows, and those with three or four angles.
Some have tongues, others have splinters.  As for the types based on the organs they enter, they fall into two categories:  either the organs are major hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. If an arrow lodges in one of these organs, and signs of death, which I will describe to you later, appear, then you should avoid extracting the arrow, for death will befall the patient in most cases. If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not deeply embedded in the organ, extract it and treat the wound.  Signs of a blow to the brain, where the arrow has penetrated the bone and wounded the meninges, include a severe headache, dizziness, and drowsiness.
If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not deeply embedded in the organ, extract it and treat the wound.  Signs of a blow to the brain, where the arrow has penetrated the bone and wounded the meninges, include a severe headache, dizziness, and drowsiness. Redness in the eyes and tongue, spasms, confusion, vomiting, and possibly bleeding from the nostrils or ears.  Speech and voice may be lost, and a whitish, porridge-like moisture may emerge from the wound, accompanied by a watery, fleshy discharge.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and extracting the arrow, if it has not yet been removed.  As for signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is near the left breast, and felt as if it had penetrated something solid, not hollow.
The arrow might pulsate like a heartbeat, and black blood might flow from the wound, followed by cold extremities, cold sweat, and fainting. Know then that death is inevitable.  A sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The blood vessels near the neck swell, the patient's complexion changes, and he breathes heavily, seeking to inhale cold air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the smaller ribs, and breathing will be labored, accompanied by severe pain.
He sighs and all the shoulder muscles move.  If the arrow strikes the liver, intense pain follows, and blood resembling the liver in its redness emerges from the wound. If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food might emerge from the wound.
Its condition is evident.  If the arrow strikes the abdomen, penetrates it, and feces, or intestinal contents, emerge from the wound, there is no hope for treatment or arrow removal.  If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine emerges,
If something protrudes from the wound and the patient's pain intensifies, know that he is doomed.  As for other organs, like the face, eyes, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are often unharmed.
Unless the arrow has struck an artery or nerve, and unless the arrow is poisoned, I will describe some of what I have observed regarding these arrows for you to understand your treatment. An arrow struck a man in the bridge of his nose near the base of his eye.
I extracted it from the other side, beneath the earlobe, and he recovered without any eye damage.  I also extracted another arrow for a Jew who had been struck in the earlobe below the lower eyelid. The arrow had disappeared, only its small tip, which adhered to the shaft, remained.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, with square, smooth iron, and no barbs. The Jew recovered without any eye injury. I also extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and it was an Arabic arrow.
It had two barbs, and I split it open between the tonsils.  It had lodged deep in his throat, and I gently worked it out.  The Christian recovered and healed. I also extracted another arrow from a man's abdomen, and we judged that he would die from it.
After about thirty days, or thereabouts, and no change in his condition, I split the arrow, worked it out, and he recovered without further injury. I also saw a man with an arrow lodged in his back, and the wound had healed over it.
Then, after seven years, the arrow emerged from the base of his thigh. I saw a woman with an arrow in her abdomen, where the wound had healed over. The arrow remained, and there was no change in her condition, nor did it interfere with her usual activities.
I saw another man with an arrow in his face, where the wound had healed over.  He experienced little pain.  Many similar cases exist. I extracted an arrow from the nose of one of the sultan's officers, which had lodged slightly to the right side of his nose.
The arrowhead disappeared completely.  I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck. I found the arrow wound very narrow.  I probed it with a slender instrument but could not feel it.  He was experiencing a prickling sensation and pain under his ear, on the right side.
I hoped that this prickling sensation was from the arrowhead. I applied a dressing with a drawing and ripening effect, hoping that the area would swell and reveal the arrowhead's location so I could extract it.  However, no sign appeared to indicate the arrow had reached that spot.
I continued to apply the dressing for many days, but nothing happened.  The wound healed over.  The patient remained hopeless for its removal for a long time until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.  He informed me of this, so I applied a strong, corrosive medication to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it.  I felt the slender arrowhead, which had become embedded in the nasal bone. Then, I continued to use the strong medication to enlarge the wound further until the arrowhead was clearly visible.  This took approximately four months.
Then, when the wound had widened and I could insert the forceps, I pulled and manipulated it, but it wouldn't come out.  I continued to use various instruments until one day I grasped it securely with strong forceps, as will be illustrated in the latter part of this chapter.
The physicians had determined that the cartilage of his nose could not be repaired, but I repaired it. The wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, without any further discomfort.  I am informing you of this method of removing certain arrows so that it serves as a model and example for what I have not yet described.
For the parts and details of this craft cannot be grasped through description, nor encompassed by a book. Instead, the skillful artisan compares the little with the much, the present with the absent, and invents a new technique and a new tool in the face of unusual cases.
If I proceed with this craft, I say that arrows are extracted from the affected body parts in two ways: either by pulling from the point of entry, or from the opposite side, the same way they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding into fleshy tissue, in which case it is pulled out, or if it does not come out immediately, you should leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh decays, making it easier to pull out and remove it.  Likewise, if it is lodged in bone.
If it does not come out, leave it for a few days and try pulling and moving it daily.  If it does not come out after a few days, you should pierce around the arrow in the same bone from every side with a fine awl until the space around the arrow is widened, then pull it out.
If the arrow is lodged in the skull, having penetrated one of the brain cavities, and some of the symptoms mentioned previously have appeared, refrain from pulling the arrow out and leave it until its condition improves after a few days.
Persist in pulling out the arrow. If it is deeply embedded and cannot be pulled out, use the awls around the arrow as described, then treat the wound until it heals.  If the arrow has become hidden in a part of the body, If it is hidden from sight, probe for it. If you feel it, pull it out using instruments suitable for extraction. If you cannot, because the wound is narrow and the arrow is deep, and there is no bone, nerve or blood vessel in the way,
make a slit to widen the wound and gain access to the arrow so you can remove it. If it has two protrusions, grasp them and remove the flesh entrapped in them in every way possible. If you cannot remove the flesh by breaking or twisting the protrusions, persist until you can extract it.
When attempting to remove the arrow at any location, use your hands and tongs in every direction to extract it. Be extremely gentle so the arrow does not break, making its removal more difficult. If you cannot remove it after some time,
leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh rots. Then try again, as it will be easier. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments described in the appropriate section.  Exercise care to avoid cutting a vein, nerve or tendon, and use skill.
Use every means possible to remove the arrow gently, carefully, and firmly, as described.  When pulling the arrow out, the patient's body position should be the same as when the arrow was lodged in it; this is optimal.
If you cannot do that, use any possible methods.  As for the arrow coming out from the opposite side, either something will have protruded outward, or you will find the arrowhead near the surface of the skin and see it protruding.
Cut around it, making the incision as large as the tongs can reach, then pull it out.  It will be easier to remove. If it is lodged in bone, twist your hands in a circular motion until the arrow affects the bone and makes space for itself, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days, then try again until it comes out. If the arrowhead is still attached, push it out with it. If the arrowhead has fallen off and you want to use a pushing method, insert the hollow instrument into the arrow's shaft, so that its hollow part is inside the arrowhead, then push it out with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that fits inside the hollow part; the arrow will come out easily. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize all the flesh affected by the poison, if possible, then treat it with an appropriate remedy.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side, and is close enough to be felt with a probe, and you can make an incision, cut around it, taking care not to sever any veins or nerves, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if necessary, then treat it until it heals.  Image of the tongs used for extracting arrows:
Its tips are like the beak of a bird, crafted like a file, so that when it grasps an arrow or something, it does not let go.  There are large, small, and medium-sized types, depending on the size of the arrow, the size of the wound.
Image of the hollow cannon:.
Image of the solid cannon:.
This one is solid at the tip, like a rod, to easily enter the hollow arrow and push it out.
Chapter Ninety-five.
In the opening of veins.
The veins customarily opened in the body are thirty.  Sixteen of these are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the *hassisin*; and the two veins on the temples, visible; and the two veins at the corners of the eyes, known as the *nazirin*.
And the vein rising in the middle of the forehead, the vein at the tip of the nose, and the two jugular veins in the neck, and the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins in the lower lip, and these veins known as the *jayhark*, and the two veins under the tongue.
And as for the veins that are opened in the arm and hand, there are five veins. One of them is the *qayfal*, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the vein of the head. The *akhal*, which is the middle vein, is composed of a branch of the *basliq* and a branch of the *qayfal*; and the common people call it the body vein.
And the *basliq*, which is situated on the inner side, is also called the axillary; and the common people call it the abdominal vein, and the arm cord, which is situated on the elbow, and to which it adheres, and it is the one that appears clearly above the thumb; and the *asilim*.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, with two branches.  In the leg and foot there are three veins: one is under the bend of the knee, on the outer side; the second is the *safin*, located at the heel, on the inner side; and the vein of the women, located at the heel, on the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to them. As for the two veins behind the ears, their opening is beneficial for chronic colds, migraines, shingles, and chronic, foul head sores; and the method of opening them, as I describe.
This is done by shaving the patient's head and rubbing its back in the area of the veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well. Then the patient's neck is constricted with a turban until the veins appear behind the ears in the lower parts of the head.  Then probe them with your finger, and where you feel a pulse beneath your finger, mark that spot with ink.
Then take a scalpel, the one known as the *nushal*, and insert it under the vein into the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upward and sever the vein with the skin, cutting it cleanly, and the length of the cut should be the size of two clenched fingers.
Or similar, and release the amount of blood desired. Then tie them with ligatures and leave them until healed.  In the beginning of the book, it was mentioned to cut and cauterize them.  As for the two arteries in the temples, their opening is beneficial for chronic migraines, severe headaches, persistent eye inflammation, and severe, persistent eye discharge.
The method of opening them, as I describe to you, is to bind the patient's neck with a turban until the veins clearly appear and their pulse is clearly felt beneath your finger.  At that point, mark it with ink. Then lift the skin above the vein with your index finger.
Insert the *nushal* scalpel from below, lift the vein upward and sever it as you did with the other veins. Release the amount of blood needed. Then, release the patient's neck constriction and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then place a piece of cloth and a ligature on it, tie securely from above, and leave it until it heals.  These were previously mentioned, cut, and released in the beginning of the book.  As for opening the forehead vein, its benefit, after opening the cephalic vein, is for chronic facial ailments like ringworm, sores, and inflamed redness.
The method of opening it, as I describe to you, is to bind the patient's neck with a turban until the vein appears. Then take the instrument called the "fأس" (axe), and this is its image:.
Place the pointed end of the axe on the same vein and strike it from above with a spatula or similar object. Allow the blood to flow to the desired amount. Then, release the patient's neck constriction and tie it tightly until it heals.
It may be opened with a broad scalpel, though it should not be as sharp as other scalpels, but rather slightly broad at the tip.  Open it by twisting, because the bone is nearby, so the scalpel might break if it is thin.
As for the veins located near the eye sockets, their benefit is for eye ailments like scabies, redness, and abscesses, and facial illnesses.  The method of opening them is for the patient to tighten their neck with a turban, then you open them while standing over their head.  Open them twisting slightly lengthwise with a small, somewhat broad scalpel.
If the area has little flesh, the scalpel might break if it is thin.  Then, draw the amount of blood you need and place a bandage over them.  Tie them for one night, then release them.  As for opening the nasal vein, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
Severe headaches and facial ailments like the red swelling that appears on the nose, especially if chronic, are treated.  The method of opening it is to have the patient tighten their neck, then grasp their nose with your left hand and take a long, thin scalpel.
Insert it into the middle of the nostril itself between the nasal passages in a straight line, because the vein is not visible there.  The blood will appear immediately.  You should insert the scalpel a little deeper, draw the amount of blood you need, and then bind it for a night, as it will clot quickly.
As for the jugular veins, opening them is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and melancholic diseases that appear on the skin's surface, such as black vitiligo, scabies, and bad ulcers and cankers.  The method of opening them is for the patient to tighten their neck beneath them with a bandage, and the surgeon stands over the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, then open the vein lengthwise with a somewhat broad incision.  Then draw the moderate amount of blood, or as much as is needed, as you see.  Then do the same to the other vein, and then release the bandage.
The two veins are tightened moderately so the patient does not suffocate, and are left until the next day, when the wound will heal.  As for the veins of the neck, opening them after opening the temporal veins is beneficial for sores in the mouth, gum disease, bad ulcers, cracked lips, and bad sores.
Those located in and around the nose.  The method of opening them is to have the patient sit in front of you, tighten their neck with a turban, and then turn their lips, looking for the two veins: one on the right side of the lip, the other on the left, and distinguish them by their blackness.
Also, there are thin black veins around them.  Cut these completely off.  If it is unclear and you do not know which one it is, aim to cut the largest and most obvious one.  Do the same for the veins on the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, opening them after opening the temporal veins is beneficial for obstructions in the throat from diseases of the tongue and mouth diseases.  The method of opening them is to have the patient sit before you facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look under the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for a vein. Their color is dark.
Open them, but be careful not to cut them deeply, because there are arteries beneath them, and bleeding might occur from those arteries.  The three veins that are opened at the elbow are those customarily opened in people.  Opening them can be done in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, fragrant or olive-shaped lancet, or by cutting with a knife-shaped lancet, which is the incision [and this is its image].  Image of the wide, fragrant lancet:.
It should be wide, as you see, to be suitable for opening the hollow, full, protruding, visible, thick veins that contain thick, dark blood. This is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:.
This lancet is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for opening thin veins containing thin, yellowish blood. This is the image of the incision lancet:.
This incision lancet, which is suitable for cutting, comes in various widths and thicknesses, depending on the width or narrowness of the veins.  It can be used as a model for other similar tools.  It is well known among craftsmen.
Regarding the jugular vein, which is one of these three veins, its benefit from incision is that it draws blood from the ailments that are beneath the throat and neck, and from those in the chest and abdomen. The surgeon, when performing the incision, must be cautious, and remain alert to the area beneath, for if an artery lies underneath, an error in piercing the vein will cut the artery.
This will cause a hemorrhage, therefore the incision should not be made with a pointed lancet, but rather a cut with the incision lancet. If the jugular vein is not clearly visible, it should be avoided and the surgeon should turn to another vein, or look for a branch of it.
Or, the arm vein can be opened, as it is clear, and incised with the incision lancet, as we have said.  If you wish to open the jugular vein itself, then before tightening the arm, you must feel the spot to find the pulse location, then mark it with ink.
Then, the arm is tied and the vein is incised, in a deflected manner with the incision lancet as we said, and make sure the blow is far from the artery.  When you see a puff in the spot you marked with ink, after tightening the bandage, then that puff is the swelling of the artery.  Avoid it.
If you see the blood during the incision jerking like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is artery blood. In that case, immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the blood stops, often it will stop, so tighten the arm.
Leave it, and warn the patient not to neglect it, and let it be on the neck, and do not move it for days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop, and you are overwhelmed and have no medicine available, sever the artery if it appears; then its ends will contract, and the bleeding will stop.
Or, take a pistachio shell, split it, and take one half. Tightly bind it to the vein with bandages and splints until the next day. If the bleeding stops, otherwise, treat it with the previously mentioned methods of applying cauterizing agents to stop the bleeding. Stopping the bleeding is not usually difficult.
Because of the small size of the wound and the firmness of the bandage on the arm, understand this.  As for the dark vein, the benefit of incising it is to draw blood from the top of the head and the bottom of the body, because it is composed of a branch from the basilic vein and a branch from the cephalic vein, as we said.
The surgeon should be careful in his incisions, for beneath them are nerves. If the lancet goes too deep and strikes a nerve, numbness occurs, difficult to cure, and perhaps it never heals. This nerve is often apparent to the touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is delicate, so that it cannot be seen, then one should make an incision with a quick, light cut to avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein lengthwise.  As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of incising it is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye ailments.  Especially if you wish to incise this vein, use a smooth lancet or a broad lancet, for it is the safest of all veins, because there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it.
However, when making the incision, you should avoid hitting the head of the muscle with the lancet, and instead seek the soft area.  If it is not struck in the first attempt, it is not harmful to repeat the incision multiple times. However, in some people, it might swell if not incised on the first attempt.
But that swelling does no harm.  As for how to make the incision, its symptoms, and what should be done to treat it, first you should know that bloodletting is used either to maintain health.
Or it is used for illnesses.  The kind used to maintain health and prevent illness should be done on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the cephalic, the basilic, and the median cubital vein.  It should be done in the early spring when signs of fullness appear.
The bloodletting should be performed on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of daylight have passed.  As for bloodletting used for illnesses, it does not have a fixed time, but rather whenever needed and required, whether at night or during the day.
At every hour and at every time.  Boys should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should elderly men who have exceeded sixty years of age.  If someone intends to perform bloodletting for any reason.
He should cleanse his bowels before bloodletting with a gentle enema if there is much accumulated phlegm, so that foul matter from the bowels does not be drawn into the veins during the bloodletting and harm the vital organs.  The apprehensive, the drunk, and the intoxicated should not be bled until this condition has passed.
Furthermore, bloodletting should be avoided following dysentery, vomiting, influenza, excessive sexual activity, exertion, exercise, late nights, fasting, and any physical or mental activity that weakens the body.  Then one should consider thinning the humors if the blood is thick.
With food, drinks, and medications, if possible.  Then he should take a bath if nothing prevents it, or engage in some exercise to thin the blood.  He should perform the bloodletting in the middle of the day, as we have said, and strive to clear his mind of all negative psychological conditions that day.
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical ailments such as excessive fatigue and exertion, sexual activity, and the like.  Pleasant things, such as perfumes, herbs, and amusements, should be present in the consultation room, in accordance with the patient's capabilities.
Then the blood-letterer sits on a higher cushion than the patient, then extends the patient's arm and the blood-letterer rubs it with their hand two or three times, then tightens the bandage with a tourniquet and twists it two or three times, with a moderate degree of tension.
Because if the tightening is excessive, it will prevent the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it will also prevent the flow of blood.  Then, after tightening, the patient should rub their hands together.
Until the veins swell and become visible to the touch. Then the blood-letterer should lightly lubricate the lancet with old oil, especially. Then he should place his left index finger on the vein slightly below the spot where he intends to lance it, so as not to misplace the vein and avoid the blow. For some veins are like tendons and retract during bloodletting, and some are filled with air.  When the lancet is placed on them, they sink below the lancet and deceive the blood-letterer, who does not open the vein.  If it is opened, the opening is narrow.
Therefore, the blood-letterer must be firm and cautious in all of these matters.  Then he should lower the lancet; if it opens the vein in that instance, then he should do it again, a bit below or above that spot, quickly if the area has not become swollen.
If the patient swells or becomes unwell, leave him for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage, for it may cause a hot swelling.  He should not enter a bath.  Then he can repeat the bloodletting if he wishes, if the lancet has pierced and the opening is small and the blood flow is thin.
And if you fear that the amount of blood required will not be drawn, re-insert the lancet into the same puncture, gently, in a straight line, and widen the opening slightly. Do this quickly before the area swells, as a small opening can cause swelling in many people.
If you see that it has swollen, do not re-insert the lancet at all, as it will not help. Apply some clarified oil to it, as it facilitates the flow of blood.  It is better in this location than the oil itself and any other ointments.
Use clarified oil in all your bloodletting of veins when the flow of blood is difficult.  This remedy (the *faruq* and *shakhzana*) may achieve this if applied to the area, as it will thin and dissolve thick blood.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of bloodletting, which often happens, especially for someone who has not had bloodletting before or if the vein opening was small, quickly apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water to the swelling and bind it for an hour.  It will dissolve.
This should be done after the complete bloodletting from the vein itself or from another vein.  If any dark or greenish discoloration remains at the site after a few days, it will not cause harm.  If you wish, apply some resolved (dissolved) alum and myrrh.
Or some juice of *foudanj* or similar.  A swelling and protuberance often occurs when bloodletting the basilic vein. Place your hand on it. If you find it pulsates when you gently touch it, this is a bad protuberance. Be careful not to apply any of the things we mentioned.
For it may be that arterial blood will bleed from it.  Bandage it with something that will constrict to harden the area, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.  The amount of blood that should be drawn from each person should be in proportion to their strength and the prevailing color of their blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red.  Similarly, if you see that it is thick, let it flow until it becomes thin.  Also, if it is sharp, let it flow until its sharpness subsides.  Bloodletting should be done in one session for those who are strong and robust.
For the strong, the vein should be incised wide, and the lancet should be broad. For the weak, the opposite should be done.  The blood should be drawn in several sessions, and the incision should be narrow.  The best tool for bloodletting a vein is a curved, oblique incision, not a piercing one.
This method of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and from severing a nerve. It is better and safer than bloodletting across or lengthwise.  If fainting frequently occurs during bloodletting, one should feed the patient some bread soaked in pomegranate juice or sherbet before the procedure.
If the patient is feverish and has blood drawn three or four times, if the temperament is cold, the patient should consume bread soaked in myrrh drink, or honeyed drink seasoned with spices, or a fragrant herbal drink before bloodletting.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting and the cause is excessive blood loss, the patient should be given meat broth and a light herbal drink.  Incense with galbanum should be used, and the chest should be washed with it.  Use all the methods described in the section on fainting.
This is for the purpose of expectoration.  As for someone who wants to further relieve their arm and release their blood a second time, if the bloodletting was for a large amount of expectoration and the patient's strength is weak, the blood should be released little by little, according to the patient's strength, over several days.
As for someone who wants to relieve their arm and release their blood a second time, if their body is strong, let them do this after seven or nine hours from the first bloodletting. As for someone who wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite side of the first bloodletting site, this should be done on the second or third day.
If the patient has a lot of blood in their body, which has become heated and intense, causing a fever, blood should be drawn in one single, large amount.  The opening should be widened until fainting occurs, after having carefully considered all the conditions of bloodletting. Place your hand on their pulse while the blood is flowing to prevent death from occurring instead of fainting.  This often happens if the bloodletter is ignorant and neglectful.  This should not be done if you are seeking to release the arm and drain blood a second time.
If the vein opening closes and blood flow is difficult, do not forcefully poke or twist it, as that is very bad.  Instead, either leave it until it can be opened again, or use the scalpel blade to remove the clotted blood from the vein opening.
Or apply something dissolved in water, like salt, or a remedy like *al-taryaq al-faruq* or *al-shakhzaniya*, and gently poke the vein until blood flows. If the vein is swollen, leave it alone.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If the need for further bloodletting arises, then either open a new vein above the previous site, or open a vein in the other arm, or another vein.
For bloodletting of the arm's vein, it is done instead of the *akhl* and *basliq* if those are unavailable or hidden, because the arm vein is made up from them.  The method is that the patient should immerse their arm in warm water until the vein is heated and shows clearly, then a medium-strength bandage is placed around it.
Then open the vein with a slight twist, neither sideways nor lengthwise, and make a wide opening, doing the bloodletting slightly above the wrist joint. If blood flow is difficult, return the arm to the warm water container and let the blood flow into the water.
Until you reach your desired amount. If it is summertime, you may not need to return the arm to the warm water.  More often, bloodletting into warm water is done in winter.  This vein's bloodletting is safer than all other veins. Because there is no vein or nerve underneath it.  Bloodletting from the *asilim* vein of the right arm is beneficial for liver ailments. The procedure is to bandage or hold the wrist with your hand, after immersing the arm in warm water until the vein swells.
Because there is no vein or nerve underneath it.  Bloodletting from the *asilim* vein of the right arm is beneficial for liver ailments. The procedure is to bandage or hold the wrist with your hand, after immersing the arm in warm water until the vein swells. It becomes very apparent to the touch, then open it with a slight twist.  Even if you accidentally cut it completely, it will not harm him.  Be careful, do not use the lancet forcefully, as there is a nerve of the fingers under it, and the area is bare of flesh. Then return the arm to the warm water.
Leave it to continue flowing. If you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein and stop flowing.  Once you have drawn the required amount of blood, place some oil and salt on the vein to prevent rapid clotting.
Likewise, you should do this with every narrow vein.  The benefit of bloodletting from the left arm is for ailments of the spleen.  You should do the same procedure for it as you did for the second one, no matter what.  As for the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower body, like uterine ailments.
And for menstrual retention, kidney ailments, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.  The procedure for bloodletting it is to immerse the leg in warm water and apply massage until the veins flow. Then, compress above the joint of the leg with a bandage. The vein is located at the heel, visible near the big toe.
Many branches extend from it in the direction of the leg.  Bloodletting should be done in the widest branch of this vein, or at the heel where it joins, as this is the best and safest approach.  If you bloodlet it on the side of the leg, be careful of the nerves underneath on the side of the leg.
Make your incision on it by twisting, as if you were trying to cut it off, and the lancet should be sharp. If the blood is difficult to draw, return the leg to warm water and let the blood flow until it is emptied. If the blood-letter misses the vein the first time.
If the blood-letter misses the vein the first time, he should move the incision slightly higher.  The location is safe, there is no danger if one is careful about the nerve, as we said.  Likewise, do the same with the saphenous vein of the other leg. As for the femoral vein, its location, as we said, is at the heel on the outer side.
Its benefit is for hip pain if it is due to hot blood. The method of bloodletting is that the patient should enter a bath, and quickly, hold the leg from the hip to above the heel with four fingers, using a thin, long bandage. It will only appear then.
Once it appears, blood-letting should be performed, in any case.  Either use a twisting motion, which is better, or cut it off with a cut, or make a slit, as its location is safe.  In most people, it is very hidden; if you don't find it.
If it does not appear at all to the touch, then blood-let some of its branches, which appear on the back of the foot, near the little and ring fingers. Be careful of the nerves, and draw the amount of blood desired.
Then release the hold, place a bandage on the bloodletting site, and bandage the area.  It will quickly heal.
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On Cupping and its Application.
Cupping vessels may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass.  Cupping is of two types: one with incision and blood extraction, and the other without incision.
And this cupping without incision is of two types.
And cupping of the nape, which are the sides of the neck on both sides; and cupping of the chin, which is under the lower jaw of the mouth; and cupping of the shoulders; and cupping of the coccyx, on the base of the spine; and cupping of the forearms, which are the middle of the arms; and cupping of the legs; and cupping of the ankles.
Cupping draws blood from the thin veins spread throughout the flesh; therefore, it does not exhaust strength like venesection.  Cupping, whether with or without fire, should not be used in any illness resulting from fullness until the entire body is emptied.
If cupping is needed, whether for illness or custom, we use it at any time, at the beginning, middle, and end of the month.
For some people, when blood increases to the point of needing cupping, they experience heaviness and headaches in their heads. Some experience fullness, redness in their face, head, and neck. Others experience itching in their face, temples, and darkening and heaviness in their eyes.  Some itch the area where they were cupped.
Some laugh excessively, some taste blood in their mouths and gums, and spit blood. Some sleep excessively, and some see blood, redness, slain people, and wounds, and the like, in their dreams.  When we see any of these things...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we order cupping after two or three hours have passed from midday.  The benefit of a light cupping is in alleviating heaviness of the head and water dripping into the eyes.
However, this should be done after the body has discharged its contents.  This cupping may be a substitute for venesection of the temples.  Caution should be taken not to use it on those with a cold head or cold, as it will greatly harm them.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly, or those with cold diseases in the head, and those who overuse it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, the cupper should lower the cup slightly to avoid the onset of forgetfulness.  Cupping of the shoulder is a substitute for venesection of the temples and venesection of the veins.
Therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, cracking of the respiratory apparatus, coughing, and fullness.  The cupping of the shoulder should be raised slightly, for if it is placed too low, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping of the temples is beneficial for pains in the head, eye inflammation, migraine, strangulation, and toothache.  It is a substitute for venesection of the veins.  The cupper should be instructed not to insert the instrument too deeply, lest a vessel be cut and bleeding result.
Cupping under the chin is beneficial for sores in the mouth, gum problems, and similar mouth ailments.  It can take the place of venesection of the veins in the lips.  Cupping of the shoulders is beneficial for palpitations arising from fullness and heat.
Cupping of the forearm is beneficial for what the venesection of the three veins—the basilic, the temporal, and the cephalic—is beneficial for, because it draws blood from all those fine veins in the flesh and draws those fine veins from other thicker veins until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to press too hard with the instrument, as the area is lacking flesh and has nerves and arteries beneath.  As for a single cupping on the coccyx, it is beneficial for hemorrhoids and sores of the lower parts.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large, brass cupping vessel, because the area requires strong suction; glass cupping vessels may break, and excessive pressure is required.  Cupping of the legs diminishes fullness noticeably.
Because it draws blood from the entire body, it is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, promoting menstruation and aiding in the treatment of boils and abscesses.  It takes the place of venesection of the saphenous and popliteal veins, although it greatly exhausts the body and causes fainting in most people.  Cupping of the popliteal veins is similar in benefit to cupping of the legs.
How to apply cupping: First, place an empty cupping vessel and apply moderate suction. Do not prolong the application; rather, quickly place and quickly remove the cupping vessel to allow the humors to collect evenly in the area. Repeat and continue this process until the area is red and open.
When the redness of the blood appears, then press and repeat the suction gradually.  Then observe the condition of the bodies; in those with delicate, porous flesh, a single application is sufficient to avoid causing an ulcer.
The cupper should widen and slightly deepen the pressure, and adjust the suction with gentle pressure and movement. If the blood is thick, it should be pressed twice. The first time to open a passage for the thin, watery blood; the second to remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very murky, the pressure should be repeated a third time to achieve the goal.  In general, if one wishes to remove a small amount of blood, one application is sufficient; if one wishes to remove a large amount, one uses more applications, especially if the blood is thick.
The pressure should be deep, but the moderate limit for pressure is just the skin's depth.  What ointments and waters should be used when applying cupping, and what should the cupper be wary of?  For those with thick, hard, dry skin and narrow pores...
The areas for cupping should be treated with softening, relaxing, and dissolving ointments. In summer, for example, the ointment of Khairy, or violet, or sweet almond, or pumpkin seed oil.
In winter, ointments like narcissus, lily, chamomile, or hyacinth, and the like. If the material is thick and cold, use ointments like marjoram, plantain, frankincense, or fennel, and the like.
If the cupper has open pores and soft flesh, then ointment should be avoided.  These should wash their cupping vessels after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or elderberry water, or pumpkin water, or rosemary water, and the like.  As for those whose blood is excessively moist...
They should wash their cupping vessels with vinegar, or rue and sumac water, and the like.  As for those whose material is thick, they should wash their cupping vessels with old wine, or marjoram water, or fennel or chamomile decoction, and the like.  Cupping should be avoided in the bath, and after the bath.
Rather, it should be used one or two hours after leaving the bath.  One should not sleep after cupping.  This is what the cupper and the leaches should arrange before and after cupping.
First, one should consider whether the cupper or leacher is bilious, with a predominating tendency toward heat and inflammation.  Then, cooling things like pomegranate, dandelion, vinegar, lettuce, and squills should be taken.  Their food should consist of poultry, mutton, and game.
If their temperament is cold, they should be given honey-based drinks, or drinks of honey and  seeds, or spiced squills.  Moderate, fragrant wine, between old and new, should be taken.  A reduction in food is ordered, and their diet should consist of poultry, quails, and sparrows, as well as pigeon’s breasts.  On the day of cupping and bloodletting, drinks should be more plentiful than food.
Sometimes, some people should be given antidote, musk medicine, or shilajit before cupping or bloodletting, or after, to strengthen the main organs and thin the blood.  It should not be given to the feverish.
As for cupping without condition, those are the cuppings placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney area, and groin, because these organs cannot tolerate being conditioned.  Rather, the intent is to draw blood from one organ to another.
For example, placing leeches on the breasts in cases of epistaxis, or to remove a cold wind that has affected an organ, like placing a leech on the abdomen and navel.  This loosens the organ, warms it, and relieves the pain by dissolving the wind.
They may be placed on the kidneys if blockages or stones are present, as their strong suction might open the blockage or dislodge the stones.  Similarly, they are used on the liver and spleen when wind troubles them.  These cupping vessels can also be used empty by suction alone.
They may be used with fire, or filled with lukewarm water for cases of phlegm.  The cupping vessel, perhaps a large one, is filled with hot water alone, or with water in which certain suitable herbs have been cooked.
Then, filled, it is placed on the area, held, and removed, repeated as needed.  This is the form of cupping that is used with fire.
Its opening should be two open fingers wide, as depicted, and its depth about half a span.  Near the middle of one side, there will be a small hole, just large enough for a needle, made of thick Chinese or brass.
It should be smooth, level, and polished so that it does not injure the organ when placed on it.  In the center, a transverse piece of brass or iron is fitted to hold the candle for the fire.  This cupping vessel may be made larger or smaller, depending on the illness.
The practitioner must use discernment; cupping for children and thin individuals is different from cupping for men and those with larger bodies.  To place the cupping vessel on the body with fire, a wick is lit from linen or a small candle made of pitch and placed on the hardened rod in the center of the cupping vessel.
To ensure the fire ascends from the top to the bottom of the cupping vessel, to prevent the patient's body from burning, it is then placed on the area.  The finger is placed in the hole mentioned, so that, when the cupping vessel is held, the finger does not need to be removed.
Steam will emerge from that hole, and the cupping vessel will be drawn to the spot. Then, the wick is relit as needed.  For cupping used for dropsy, there is no hardened rod or hole.
Instead, it is used by filling with water and placing it directly onto the area.  This is its form.
The larger the cupping vessel, the more water it holds, the better.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
On the application of leeches.
Leeches are used most often on parts of the body where cupping cannot be applied, either because they are small, like the lips and gums, or because the area is bare of flesh, like the finger and nose.
To use them, select leeches from clean, unpolluted fresh water, then leave them in fresh water for a day and a night so that they become hungry and have nothing left in their stomachs. Then, the body is first purged with bloodletting or cupping, and then the affected area is cleaned.
Until it turns red, then the leech is placed on it. If it fills up, it will fall off. If it is possible to draw the affected area with a cupping vessel, this is more beneficial. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage and squeeze it. If bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and it is a trickle, then soak a linen cloth in cool water.
Place it over the area until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered alum, or a similar astringent, over it until the bleeding stops, or place scraped halves of chickpeas on the area.
Leave it until the chickpeas adhere to the area, and the bleeding will stop.  If it is necessary to re-apply the leeches, do not use the same leeches if possible. If the leeches refuse to attach, then wipe the area with fresh blood.
Or, pierce the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then apply it. If it senses some blood, it will attach to the spot. If you want it to fall off, sprinkle some dates, salt, or ash on it, and it will fall off.
Chapter Three.
On Fractures.
This chapter also, from the stratagems necessary in the art of medicine, is on the setting of fractures and dislocations that occur in the bones.
Know, O my children, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among doctors and the common people, those who have never perused the books of the ancients on it, nor read a single word from them.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become extinct in our country, and I have never encountered a skilled practitioner in it. Rather, I benefited from it to the extent that I benefited from it through my long study of the books of the ancients and my diligence in understanding them, until I extracted the knowledge from them. Then, I adhered to experience and practice throughout my life.
I have depicted for you in this chapter everything encompassed by my knowledge. My experience has passed over it, after I brought it closer to you, purged it of prolixity, condensed it to the utmost brevity, elucidated it to the utmost clarity, and depicted for you numerous images of the instruments used in it.
It is, indeed, from the increase of clarity, as I have done in the preceding two chapters.  There is no power except with God, the Most High, the Great.
The First Chapter.
In it are summaries and collections concerning the matter of fractured bones, which should be presented beforehand. Before we begin to describe the fractured and dislocated limbs one by one, it is necessary in the introduction to this chapter to mention summaries and sections. This will first compel you, and anyone else zealous to learn this noble craft, to understand them and grasp their true meaning.
If someone suffers a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall, one must first hasten to reduce the fracture or dislocation, or both. Unless prevented by factors such as weakness, or if the affected person is a child or an elderly person, or the weather is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then, his diet should be restricted to cold legumes, poultry, and venison.  Drinks, thick meats, overeating, and all foods that fill the veins with blood should be avoided, until the swelling subsides and there is no further anticipated effusion to the affected area.
Then, the patient should return to his original diet, as was his custom.  If the broken bone starts to knit, the patient should eat foods that are nutritious, substantial, and firm, with a thick consistency, such as barley, rice, bulgur, and ox tripe. Eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and similar foods, will result in faster and better healing of the fracture.  Know that fractured bones in strong men and the elderly will not likely heal to their original state.
Due to their dryness and hardness, the bones may not completely heal.  However, those bones that are extremely pliable, like the bones of young children, may heal.  Nature produces a substance around the fractured bone, similar to glue, with a thick consistency that adheres to and binds the pieces together.
Binding them together until they reach the same strength and firmness as before, so that nothing hinders their function.
For this reason, the patient's diet should consist of foods that are strong, thick, and viscous, as we have stated.  Know that fractures differ in type based on the affected limb, as a fracture of the leg differs from a fracture of the head, and a fracture of the chest differs from a fracture of the spine.
And so do all the other limbs.  We will describe each type of fracture in detail in its respective section, and the type of fracture can even vary within the same bone.
Because the fracture may be a simple crack without splintering, or it may be along the length of the bone with splinters and fragments, some detached, some not.  The fracture may be accompanied by a wound and a break in the skin, or it may be a minor fissure.
Each type requires a specific method of reduction, which will be detailed later in its appropriate place.  A fracture is recognized by its distortion, unevenness, and visibility to the touch, and by the creaking sound when the bone is gently prodded with a hand.
If there is no visible distortion, no creaking, and no pain or discomfort on palpation of the bone, there is no fracture, but rather a sprain, a minor fracture, or a minor fissure.  In such cases, the affected limb should not be moved by pulling or prodding at all.
Instead, apply the appropriate medications, which will be described later, to the affected area, then apply a gentle bandage.  Know that when a bone is fractured in two without splinters, each part has completely separated from its partner.
You should immediately attempt to realign and straighten the bone before it develops a hot swelling. If a hot swelling does develop, allow it to subside for several days before attempting realignment with the gentlest possible methods.
Know that realignment and straightening are easier in a bone that has not splintered.  Then it is bandaged as described later. If the bone has splinters, the fractured limb (arm or leg) must be stretched from both ends.
Either by hand, if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand. Position the limb on a level surface in its natural shape.  When the fractured bone segments have been stretched, carefully return the protruding parts to their proper places using all possible gentle methods.
Strive to cause no pain or suffering to the patient through your actions.  Concentrate on joining the two bone segments together in the best possible alignment.  At this time, it is necessary to touch and examine them with your hand. If you find anything out of place, correct and align it to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive stretching and forceful manipulation, as many untrained practitioners do.  Frequently, their actions cause a hot swelling or inflammation in the limb, as I have observed repeatedly.
After alignment, meticulous work, and bandaging, keep the limb still and quiet. Warn the patient not to move it during waking hours, sleeping hours, during changes in posture, during restlessness, during bowel movements, and with all his movements to the best of his ability.  He should strive to ensure the limb's position is one that avoids pain.
If, during the limb's positioned state, he feels pain or discomfort, he should reposition the limb to a position free of pain.  Furthermore, he should ensure that his position is straight and even.
To prevent a crooked limb if it is set, the method for bandaging a fractured limb is as I describe for you. Know that broken limbs differ in their size, age, and condition.  Those that are small, such as the arm, fingers, forearm, and similar parts, ...
Thin bandages are appropriate for smaller limbs, like the arm and fingers.  For larger limbs such as the thigh, back, and chest, bandages should be firm and broad.  A wide bandage is needed to support a large limb and to apply equal pressure on all sides without any gaps.
Then, after completing the alignment, apply the appropriate plaster. First, apply a soft bandage to the fracture site. Then begin wrapping the bandage around the fracture itself, three or four times, depending on the limb's needs.  Slightly tighten the bandage, and then move it towards the upper part of the fracture.
Applying less tension than you did on the fractured area, gradually move the bandage away from the fracture, loosening the pressure little by little until you achieve a correct position. Then take another bandage and wrap it similarly over the fractured area.
Wrap it around several times, then move the wrapping to the lower part of the fracture.  Maintain the same tension and looseness as in the first wrap on the upper part.  Place soft padding or bandages between the layers to correct any misalignment of the fracture.
If there is misalignment, correct it; otherwise, do not add anything. Then wrap another bandage around it.  Finally, if there is no swelling or heat in the limb, apply firm splints to these layers.
If there is swelling or heat, apply something to soothe the swelling and reduce the inflammation. Leave it for a few days, then apply the splints.  The splints should be made of smooth, skillfully cut reed stalks or from the wood of sieves.
These [splints] can be made from pine, palm leaves, reeds, or other similar readily available materials.  The size of each splint should be identical to the one previously described.
However, the splint directly applied to the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the others.  The splint's length should be determined by the size of the fractured limb.  [Image/Diagram of the splint]
Then, apply another bandage to the splints, tightening it in the same manner as the first bandage.  Tie it securely with strong threads from above, tightening the bandage more over the fracture site. The tighter the bandage, the closer to the fracture.
The threads should be of medium thickness and be made from damp linen.  If the threads are thick, like those made from twisted linen strips, as the ignorant often do, this is a grave error.
Because this creates an uneven tension.  Thin threads are also unsuitable, as they cannot provide the required tension.  There should be at least a finger's width between splints.
If the patient is injured by the edges of the splints after proper application, place soft padding such as linen or fluffy wool underneath to prevent further injury. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and the skin is broken, we will address this separately.
Know that not every fractured limb should be splinted from the first day.  If the limb is large, splints should not be applied until five, seven, or more days later, depending on your assurance that inflammation will not occur.
This is a description of the bandages used by the ancients to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  It is a concise, common bandage that sets bones, and is suitable for most temperaments, particularly children and women, as it is not affected by heat or cold.
Take the flour dust, the residue of flour from a millstone, and knead it as it is, without sifting it with egg white. Make the dough neither thick nor thin, then dry it.
Another bandage for fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  Take ten dirhams each of mastic, ladanum, acacia, asps, myrrh, and alum; five dirhams each of tragacanth and saffron; twenty dirhams of frankincense; and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Roman clay. Grind all the ingredients and mix with frankincense water or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot. This bandage is effective, sets broken bones quickly, and is suitable for most people due to its balance.
Another bandage useful for fractures and sprains. Take ten dirhams each of myrrh, mastic, and white hyacinth; five dirhams each of tragacanth and saffron; six dirhams of acacia; and twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind all thoroughly, sift, knead with water or egg white, and apply.
A bandage for dislocated joints and bones, relieving pain and treating bone throbbing and fractures. Take softened wool, dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply to the affected area.  This bandage does not provide the strength of a fracture repair.
However, it is excellent for relieving hot swelling and pain. Another bandage for setting a fractured bone. Take the leaves of the wild fig and the leaves of the wild poppy, grind them together, and apply the paste to the injured area. Another short bandage is used for an impacted fracture.
If you wish to treat the remaining swelling, take equal parts of the root of hyacinth, chamomile, violet, and carob flour. Grind all and knead with plaster if the limb is not inflamed. If it is inflamed, knead with coriander water or water, and apply.
Another stronger resolving bandage, to be used when a hard swelling occurs with an impacted fracture.  Take equal parts of hyacinth root, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, violet, and chamomile.
Grind all together, kneading with vinegar water, or fresh water, or plaster, depending on the heat of the limb and its cooling.  Hippocrates, however, did not mention in his book that this should be applied to a fractured limb during setting.
Except for the cerot of wax and oil alone, described as being medium in thickness and texture.  Galen, however, considered that things containing dryness with a degree of warmth, such as myrrh, mastic, and frankincense, and similar substances, should be applied to the fractured limb during the setting procedure.
A bandage for weakness and pain.  Take equal parts of dried figs, roasted chickpeas, shaved human hair or bird feathers, hyacinth, and salt. Grind, sieve, knead, and apply as a dressing.  Now, as to the amount of ligament that should remain...
Then, it should be removed.  Observe; if the patient experiences no pain, rubbing, or displacement of the fractured bone, do not remove it for many days.  However, if there is severe rubbing, distressing pain, or swelling in the area,
Then immediately remove it, and do not delay.  Remove the dressing. Then take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the itching and pain subside. Then allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Then apply softened wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose ointment, and bind it for the night, so that the inflammation subsides, the swelling of the limb diminishes, and the pain disappears.  Then, gently reapply a light bandage; do not apply it as tightly as the initial dressing.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and swelling have completely disappeared, and the dressing and bandage are needed, then reapply them as you did initially.  If none of these symptoms remain in the limb,
then do not remove it until three, four, five, or seven days later, or even twenty days, depending on the condition of the limb, as we have stated, until the fracture is secure and the flesh begins to knit together.
Then, increase the tightness of the bandage beyond the original bandage.  Also, increase the patient's nourishment, as previously mentioned. If you see that the fracture site has dried out and wasted more than it should, know that the nourishment is not reaching it.
So loosen it with lukewarm water each time you remove it, every three days, and reduce the tightness of the bandage slightly. This action will bring nourishment to the limb and promote rapid healing.  As for the actions of ignorant people, who cause the limb to break again...
...for if it was not initially set correctly and is set crookedly, that is a mistake on their part and a great deception.  If it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their writings and practiced it.  I have seen no evidence of this from any of them at all. The correct approach is not to do this.
Chapter Two.
Concerning fractures of the head.
Fractures of the head are numerous, their shapes varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures occur from a sword blow, and in these, the bone may break completely, extending to the peritoneum beneath the bone. As happens with wood when struck.
This type of fracture is called a "contusional" fracture. Alternatively, the sword may sever a portion of the bone, fracturing only one side, without penetrating completely; this is called a complete fracture, and the wounds from these two types of fracture can be either large or small.
Some fractures are caused by bruising or contusion, resulting from a blow with a stone, a fall on a stone or similar object.  This type of fracture can either penetrate to the membrane beneath the bone, or remain on the surface of the bone.
The wounds from these fractures can also be large or small.  Some fractures are hidden within the bone, as subtle as a hairline crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.  It can result from a fall or a blow from a stone or similar object, causing a portion of the bone to sink inwards, creating a concavity, just as a piece of copper would sink in if struck.
This is most often seen in the soft, bony skulls of children.  All these types of fractures may have displaced or undisplaced fragments.  We will discuss the treatment for each in its proper place.  All these types of fractures can be identified by examination.
Examine them with probes and remove any infected flesh.  The hairline fracture is identified by examining the bone, rubbing and staining it with ink; the fracture will show as black.  The treatment for the fracture first involves assessing the patient's symptoms.
If you see obvious symptoms of danger, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, bloodshot and reddened eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach or treat the patient.  In most cases, death is inevitable with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and hope for recovery, then begin treatment.  This is especially true if the injured person comes to you at the very moment of the injury, during the winter months.
You should strive to remove the bone by the fourteenth day, regardless of when the injury occurred.  If the injury occurred during the summer, you should remove the bone before the seventh day, to prevent the membrane under the bone from decaying and leading to the symptoms described.
If the fractured bone has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is crushing and laceration, you should cut away the crushed and lacerated portion, as I describe to you: shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way possible, based on the shape of the wound and the patient's tolerance. If, during the exposure of the bone, you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling, treat it as necessary.
This involves filling the area with rags soaked in rosewater and oil, and cleansing the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding ceases.  Then, proceed with the repositioning and removal of the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.
One method is to cut the bone with a narrow, gentle incision.  This is how it is done:
Then, use another incision slightly wider than the first.  This is how it is done:
Then, use yet another incision even wider than the second.  You should have a set of different incisions, some wider than others, some shorter than others, with very sharp edges.  Let them be made from Indian steel or good quality iron.
Use gentleness when striking the incision to avoid displacing the head and injuring it.  If the bone is strong and hard, you should first pierce around it using the so-called "non-dipping" awls, before using the incisions.
Because they do not penetrate beyond the skull bone, as the awl has a rounded edge below its sharp head, like a ring or small circle, preventing it from sinking in and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these awls, each suited to the thickness of that bone, so that you have, for every skull, an awl whose sharp point is appropriate in length and shortness to the thickness of that skull.  This is an example of three types. Of awls, large, medium, and small.
As for how to pierce around the fractured bone, place the awl on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then move the awl to another place, and maintain a distance between each hole equal to the thickness of a rod or similar.
Then cut with the pliers between each two holes, doing so with the utmost gentleness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either by hand or with another tool you have prepared for this.
Like fine forceps and pliers.  You must be extremely careful that the awl or pliers do not touch any of the peritoneum. If you have smoothed the bone and freed it from the peritoneum, if it was attached to it, and removed it, then it must be cleaned.
Any roughness remaining on the bone is smoothed with another instrument similar to the pliers, but it must be finer and more delicate than the other pliers.  If any small bones or fragments remain, remove them gently with the tools you have.
Then treat the wound afterwards with the compresses and ointments that will be mentioned.  The other approach to this procedure is quite straightforward and free from risk.  Galen spoke of it and praised it highly.  This is what he said. First, you should begin by exposing the section of the bone where the fracture is most severe and prominent.  Once you have exposed that section, place the tip of this lentil-shaped instrument under it. This is its image.
The lentil-shaped part of it should be smooth, not cutting anything.  The pointed part of it along its sides should extend in length, as you see, so the lentil-shaped part rests against the peritoneum, and the pointed part of the instrument is on the bone.  Then strike the instrument from one side.
With a small hammer, until all the bone is broken gently, as it turns.  You are safe from injuring the membrane, nothing frightening happens, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and timid of men, yes, even if he were asleep.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some places, scrape it off with the tip of the lentil-shaped instrument itself, and remove it gently. It will come away without harm or fear.
If the fracture of the bone did not penetrate the membrane, and the broken surface of the bone remains rough and jagged, then you should remove those rough edges and fragments with sharp instruments of different sizes, so you can use the one best suited to each location, according to what the work dictates.
The broken bone and its shape, and you should use the broadest of those instruments to scrape the bone first, and then use a finer one after that, and continue to do so until you reach the use of the finest and slimmest of them all.
As for other small, hairline fractures and delicate breaks, one should use a treatment for each, as indicated by what will lead to its repair; this is something not hidden from anyone with the slightest skill in this craft who has studied what we have written and explained concerning larger fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, you should take a linen cloth sized to the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound's opening. Then take another cloth, folded or triangular. Soak it in rose water and rose oil and place it on top of the first cloth.  Do this as gently as possible so as not to weigh down the peritoneum. Then, apply a wide bandage over it, tightening it only enough to hold the wound in place.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two until the hot swelling subsides, then remove it.  Afterwards, use remedies with a drying quality such as iris root, poppy seed, kender, and zeraوند, and similar.  Make a paste from these remedies.
Dust the wound with it in its dry form.  In general, use a remedy that cleanses without stinging.  Strive diligently during wound treatment to ensure it is clean, free of grease or dirt, and do not allow pus to accumulate in it.
Because if pus collects on the membranes of the brain, it corrupts and contaminates it, causing the patient great harm.  This can happen in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If a dark discoloration appears on its surface, and if the patient displays the symptoms we mentioned, know that he is inevitably doomed. However, if the discoloration was caused by a remedy applied and the remedy's potency was such that it caused this discoloration, .
You should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, mix them thoroughly, and apply the mixture to a cloth.  Place the cloth on the peritoneum.  Then treat it with appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Three.
For the setting of a fractured nose.
Know that only the upper portions of the nose, either both or one, can break, because they are bony.  The lower portion is cartilaginous and does not break, but may be bruised, bent, or punctured.
If one of the bony portions breaks, you should insert a small finger into the nostril and straighten the fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb on the outside, until the nose is restored to its natural shape.  Do this gently, making sure not to cause pain to the patient.
If the fracture is high up on the nose and cannot be reached with a finger, it should be straightened with a blunt, slightly rounded instrument.  If the fracture is in both sides, do likewise.  He should hasten to set the fracture on the first day after it occurs.
If possible, or else after seven or ten days, when the inflammation has subsided, a thread of linen should be inserted into the nostril(s) if the fracture is on one side, or two threads if it is on both sides.
The thread should be thick enough to fill the nostril.  Some early surgeons recommended soaking the thread in clarified butter and changing it each day, but I do not agree.  Instead, the thread should be soaked in beaten egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then the thread is left in place until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens.  Goose feather tubes may be inserted into the nostril where the thread is, wrapped with soft linen.  This would make the holding of the nasal fracture stronger and to prevent the patient from being unable to breathe.
This is not essential; you may do it or not, as you wish, and use the threads instead.  If, during the treatment, the nose becomes inflamed, bandage the nose with linen soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or with a preparation of diachylon.
If no inflammation occurs, bandage the outside with fine semolina and ground kender mixed with beaten egg white, then place soft linen over it.  Do not bind the nose at all, if the nasal bones are fractured in small pieces.
Or if it splintered, then it must be separated and removed with the appropriate instrument, then the split must be sutured and treated with ointments suitable for healing and suppuration.  If a wound occurs inside the nose, it must be treated with thread and lead tubes must be used. Until it heals.
Fourth Chapter.
On setting broken lower jaw.
If the lower jaw is broken but not accompanied by a wound, and if the fracture is only from the outside, not fractured in two places and does not curve inwards, its recognition is easier.
If the fracture is in the right side, the index finger of the left hand should be inserted into the patient's mouth.  Likewise, if the fracture is in the left side, the index finger of the right hand should be inserted and gently raise the hump of the fracture from the inside outwards.
Your other hand, from outside the bone, controls its alignment.  If the jaw fracture has splintered in two places, it is necessary to use traction from both sides in a straight line until alignment is achieved. If it has occurred in the teeth, it should be trimmed.
Or, if it has separated, tie together what you expect to remain with a thread of gold, silver, or silk.  Then place a splint of qirūṭī on the broken jaw, then place a folded cloth over it, and place a large, tight bandage, or a piece of leather the length of the jaw, over the cloth. Then tie it from above as you find suitable for its closure, so it does not dislocate.  Order the patient to rest and remain quiet. Give him soft food.  If you suspect any change in shape, proceed to remove it on the third day.
Then tie it from above as you find suitable for its closure, so it does not dislocate.  Order the patient to rest and remain quiet. Give him soft food.  If you suspect any change in shape, proceed to remove it on the third day. Then repair the bandage with flour from a millstone and egg white, or semolina flour, after removing the qirūṭī. Place a soft compress on the bandage.  As long as the bandage adheres and the condition of the bone has not changed, leave it in place.
Do not remove it until the fracture heals and strengthens.  Frequently, the fracture strengthens in three weeks.  If a hot swelling appears during that time, use the remedies we have previously described to relieve it until it subsides.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, observe it. If a fragment or fragments of bone have separated from the rest, carefully remove these fragments with appropriate instruments.  If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as needed.
Then, after removing the fragments and there is nothing left, suture the wound opening if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the appropriate ointments. And close the wound until it heals.
Fifth Chapter.
On the treatment of a fractured collarbone.
The collarbone is most often fractured from the front, near the acromion.  The fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks and splinters in two without causing fragments, which is easiest to treat;
Or, the fracture may involve fragments, which is more difficult to treat; or the fracture may occur with a wound. If the fracture is without a wound, have two assistants; one to hold the arm adjacent to the fractured collarbone, the other to extend the neck to the opposite side.
Then, straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct, without any protuberances or irregularities.  If further extension is needed, a ball of linen or wool should be placed under the patient's armpit.
Adjust the bone as needed, extending and elevating the collarbone and pressing on the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned.  If you cannot draw the end of the collarbone outward because it has sunk inwards, the patient should lie on their back.
A moderate-sized cushion is placed under the patient's shoulder, and the assistant pushes down on the shoulder to raise the recessed bone of the collarbone.  Then, correct and align the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the collarbone has broken off and is moving, you should carefully separate and remove the fragment. If the fragment is lodged within the bone, use one of the instruments you have prepared to cut it out. After placing the instrument that protects the diaphragm, which is made of wood or iron, underneath the collarbone—this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a handle. Its width should correspond to the size of the bone, and its length should be appropriate for your work. It should have two ends, one wider and the other narrower, as you see.
If the wound you made to remove the bone fragment is wide and you anticipate inflammation, stitch the edges of the wound together.  If the wound is small or you fear inflammation, close the wound with sutures and bandages, commensurate with the size of the incision.
If an inflammatory swelling occurs, soak the bandages in rose-water and vinegar or a drink and apply them.  If the bone is dislocated without a wound or incision, apply a bandage made of mill dust mixed with egg white to the bone. Place a soft splint on it, then if needed, place a ball under his armpit.  Then, take a very long bandage, about a span wide or so.  Wrap a folded bandage over the splint and dressing.  Then take a splint made of thin wood. Make it three fingers wide and the same in length. Then wrap it in a cloth, and wrap that cloth with the splint into the part of the bandage that covers the fracture.  Then tie the bandage around the fracture, as you would a turban. Wrap it around his neck and under his healthy armpit and under his injured armpit, and return it repeatedly to each side.  How you see that the tightening secures the fracture firmly, is something you should know.
The whole point is that the splint must not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day.  Whenever the ligament loosens and you see the splint has moved, correct it and tighten the bandage.  Then, have the patient sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
To raise his arm from his side, so the clavicle fracture rises with the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck.  Do not loosen the bandage unless a wound or swelling appears at the site within twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see reason for it. Apply pressure and leave it until the fractured clavicle is healed and strengthened.  It will become even stronger within twenty-eight days. And in some people, it may happen sooner.
Chapter Six.
On the reduction of a fractured shoulder.  The shoulder rarely fractures in its broad area; rather, its processes fracture.  If a part or the middle fractures, this is determined by palpation.  Then, according to the nature of the fracture, apply traction.
Reduce and return it to its natural shape by every means possible.  Then, apply mill dust mixed with egg white and soft plaster to the affected area. Place a folded cloth dressing over this and, finally, apply a wide splint of wood.
Make the splint as wide as the entire shoulder, or slightly wider. If there is an indentation under the splint on any part of the shoulder, smooth this indentation with soft plaster until the splint lies flat. Then, secure it from above with a long bandage.
Secure the splint firmly so it does not shift from its position.  Examine the bandage each day; if it loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it shifts.  The patient should lie on their healthy side. The shoulder will be healed in twenty days.
After one or twenty-five days, remove the bandage and you will be safe.  It is a bone that does not fear splintering or dislocation.  If a bone fragment protrudes from the bone and pierces the skin, incise over it and extract it. Do what I have described for fractured clavicles to alleviate any inflammation that might occur.
Chapter Seven.
For the setting of fractured ribs.
The chest can break in its center, though this is rare.  Its extremities, however, are more likely to fracture and splinter.  If the center breaks, symptoms include a downward tilting of the chest, intense pain, and difficulty breathing and coughing.
Sometimes blood may be coughed up, and the depression in the fractured bone will be evident and palpable.  To set it, the patient should lie on their back, with a pillow between their shoulders. Then, the patient's sides should be pressed together, and the ribs brought together with the hands from the sides, gently smoothing the fracture in every possible way.
And maintain this until the bone returns to its proper shape. Then apply a bandage and splint, placing a splint of thin, light wood, such as poplar or willow, over it, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then, gently bind the splint to the fractured bone so it doesn't shift.  Wrap the bandage in a circular motion around the back several times, tightening it firmly.  Then, check the bandage regularly, and tighten it whenever it loosens.
If the splint needs to be removed due to an irritation, pain, or swelling in the area, promptly remove it and the bandage. Correct any issue that has arisen.  Then, if you deem it necessary, reapply the bandage. And apply pressure and maintain the tension until he is healed.
Chapter Eight.
In the setting of fractured ribs, know that fractures occur in the thick portions adjacent to the spine, and their anterior extremities.  Injuries occur because they are cartilaginous.  This knowledge is not hidden to the touch when examining with the fingers.
To treat it, align the fracture with the fingers in the appropriate manner until the shape is correct. Then, bandage and apply a splint to the fractured bone if necessary.  If the rib fracture is inward, the patient will experience severe pain.
And it causes pain like that of someone with a hernia, because the bone pierces the diaphragm.  This also causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and the expulsion of a great deal of blood. This is a difficult condition to treat, and the ancients devised many methods for it.
Some have said that the patient's diet should include foods that produce flatulence and wind, so that the abdomen becomes distended and the fracture is pushed outward.  We do not approve of this, lest it confirm the development of a hot swelling. If it has not yet occurred, it will be further encouraged and confirmed.
Some said that a cupping glass should be applied to the area, and then suctioned forcefully.  This is more in line with reason, but there is concern that the cupping glass will be drawn to the area due to its weakness.  Others said that the area should be covered with wool dipped in hot oil.
The spaces between the ribs become filled in, so that the ligament becomes even when wrapped in a circular manner.  Then, treat the patient with the same treatment as a hernia, in terms of diet and medication, if the condition is too taxing for the patient to bear. The bone was piercing the diaphragm with a painful penetration.  We feared for the patient, therefore it is necessary to incise the area, uncover the broken rib, and place under it the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which has been previously described, and to carefully remove the bone and take it out.
Then, if the wound is large, we bring together the edges of the wound by stitching and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling appears during this time, quickly apply rose-oil-soaked strips to the area and treat the patient internally with something that reduces the swelling.
He should lie on the side on which he sleeps more easily until he is healed.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Concerning the bones of the neck, if fracture occurs, it is uncommon.  More often, contusion occurs.  Similarly, for the vertebrae of the back.  If this happens to someone, and you wish to know if he will recover or not... If you see that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and lifeless, and he cannot move them, extend them, or close them; and if you pinch or prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and finds no pain in them, know then that he will not recover in most cases; he is doomed.
If he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking, know that the spinal cord is unharmed, and the patient will recover with treatment. If a similar condition affects the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know if he will recover or not...
Examine his legs. If you see that they too have become relaxed, and the same condition as the hands has occurred, then if he lies on his back, wind and stool come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily. If, lying on his back, he tries to urinate and cannot, know that he is doomed.  Do not bother with treatment.  If none of this occurs, the situation is less severe.  Treatment for what has happened should focus on calming the hot inflammation.
Apply rose oil, alone or with roasted egg yolks, to the affected vertebrae three times a day, until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply one of the strengthening, dry bandages, and bind it tightly with a bandage.  Instruct him to rest and remain still.
He should only sleep on the side that does not cause pain until he recovers. If, due to the injury, a splinter or something similar has formed within the bone and healed over, it is necessary to cut through the skin and remove that piece of bone. Then, if the wound is large, bring the edges together with sutures, and treat it with healing ointments until it heals.  If the last bone of the coccyx, the tailbone, is also broken, you should insert the little finger of your left hand into the rectum.
Straighten the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and as easily as you can, then apply a bandage and splint if needed, and bind it tightly.
If you feel a fractured splinter in it, cut through it and remove it, and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Fractures of the hip bones are rare. If a fracture does occur, it typically involves shattering at the edges, a longitudinal splitting, and an inward tilting.  The patient experiences pain, tenderness, and numbness in the affected leg.
To set it, run your hand over it to ascertain the nature of the fracture.  If the fracture is only at the edges, align the edges of the fracture to the best of your ability, until it resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture is longitudinal or has tilted inward, lay the patient on their stomach to facilitate setting the fracture.  Once aligned, apply a bandage, then a splint of wood or leather, and secure it tightly.
Do not fear the displacement of the fracture or the loosening of the splint.  Fill any depressions in the hips with material to ensure the splint is properly aligned.  Instruct the patient to sleep on their back or their healthy side if a hot swelling develops.
Refrain from manipulating or setting the fracture until the hot swelling subsides.  Apply remedies as previously described to reduce the swelling, then resume setting and securing the fracture as needed.  If fragments or splinters of bone are present, they should not be removed.
Do not touch [the bone], but align it from the outside, as we stated, and leave it secured until healed.
Chapter Eleven.
On setting a fractured humerus.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, set it by one of two methods. One is to take a smooth, slightly curved stick of medium thickness, like this:
Tie straps to its ends, then hang it from a high place. The patient sits on a chair, and then lays the fractured arm across the stick so that their armpit is positioned at the center of the stick's curve.  Then hang a heavy object from above it.
Or, an assistant pulls it downwards, and then the physician straightens the fracture with their hands, until the fracture is corrected. The other method is for the patient to lie on their back, and their arm is hung from their neck with a strap.
Then order two assistants. One should hold above the fracture, the other below, and each pull in their direction. If you want a stronger pull, tie a strap below the fracture and another above, and have each assistant pull in their direction.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, the strap should be placed under the armpit, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow. Likewise, if the fracture is near the elbow, the strap should be placed at that location and at the elbow itself.
Then gently straighten the fracture without force until the fracture is properly aligned and joined well.  Then tighten it, unless a hot swelling appears. If a hot swelling appears, delay tightening until the seventh day. Apply moistened cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil to it.
Until the swelling subsides. Then, tighten it.  The method of tightening is to place the bandage on the fracture, then wrap a fresh cloth bandage over the first. Then, hold the arm close to the upper arm, and place the hand open on the shoulder.
And hold the cloths and tightening on the upper arm and forearm so that the arm takes the place of splints, if nothing prevents you from doing so and nothing of the broken bone has changed. If you fear that something of the broken bone may change, then use splints.
It is that you place a splint on the fracture itself, one that is wider and stronger than other splints.  Let there be a space of one finger's width between each splint.  Let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tightening described in the first chapter.
It is that your tightening should be stronger at the site of the fracture.
And the further from the fracture, the less the tightening. If you see the placement of the splints and the tightening as we described in the section on setting the limb, then do so.
And if you fear the inflammatory swelling, leave the tightening and splints until the seventh day, as we said.  Then examine the ligaments every three days, lest a sore, or inflammation, or difficulty in the limb receiving nourishment arise due to excessive tightening.  All of this will be remedied as we have described.
If you are certain that none of this will occur, do not loosen the ligaments until after many days.  The patient should lie on their back, hand on their abdomen, and a padded armrest filled with wool should be placed under the elbow, even.
And examine at all times, night or day, lest the shape of the fractured limb shift or the ligaments loosen.  Correct all of this with your effort, and make the patient's diet as we previously stated, initially gentle, until the bone is strengthened.
Then his diet should be thickened.  It is the custom of the arm and leg to strengthen in forty days.  At that time, the ligaments should be loosened, and baths should be taken, and treated with ointments appropriate for this, if the fracture is severe and extensive.
Do not loosen the ligaments for fifty days, or until two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On setting a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones.  One is called the radius, the smaller one, which is next to the thumb. The other is the ulna, the larger one, situated beneath the smaller one, at the bottom.  Perhaps the larger ulna bone is fractured alone, or the smaller radius bone alone, or perhaps both are fractured together.
If the upper small radius bone is fractured, its reduction is easy and its healing is quicker. If the lower ulna bone is fractured, the fracture is bad and healing is difficult.  The worst case is when both bones are fractured together.  If the bone fractured is the upper small radius bone...
Therefore, the physician must, when setting it, apply a gentle and slight traction to align it. If the larger ulna bone is fractured, the traction should be stronger. If both bones are fractured, the traction must be very strong.
When setting and pulling the hand, it should be positioned on a cushion, with the thumb raised higher than all the other fingers, the pinky finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient seated upright.
Let the cushion be at his level in height so that the patient does not have to strain.
Then, a servant pulls the arm from below, either with their hand or a bandage, and another servant pulls from above.  The physician then aligns the bone, returning it to the best possible shape.  If the fracture has splinters, they are to be removed.
Return each splinter to its place.  If a splinter remains detached, piercing the skin, and you have no hope of setting it, cut over it and remove it in the manner previously described.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate section is devoted to it.
If a hot swelling appears during the initial setting, apply a compress made from rose ointment and white wax, of a medium thickness, and bandage it gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the compress, and apply a dressing prepared from mill dust and egg white.  Then apply splints.  The splint placed directly on the fracture should be wider and stronger.  Know that in most cases, six splints will be used for the arm.
If the fracture is in one radius or both radii, then make your traction stronger at the site of the fracture.  And the more you pull upward or downward, the gentler the traction should become, as previously mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Let the bandages wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, not overly stiff.  Let the thread used for tying be linen of medium thickness, as described.  Examine the limb and ligaments after several days.
If a problem arises, such as irritation of the limb, the limb should be rinsed with warm water until the irritation subsides.  The limb should be left untensioned for a night to rest, then traction should be resumed.
If the traction has become too weak and the bone has shifted, or something similar has occurred, correct it to the best of your ability.  Also, if the limb is deprived of nourishment due to excessive traction, the traction should be eased slightly, and the limb left undisturbed for several days to allow nourishment to reach it, then the traction should be resumed.
If none of the aforementioned issues arise, the splint should not be removed until about twenty days, or thereabouts.  Then suspend the patient's arm from their neck, keeping the arm straight.  The patient should avoid disruptive movements, and sleep on their back.
Know that this fracture of the arm is usually set within thirty, or thirty-two days, and sometimes in twenty-eight days, all depending on the temperaments and strengths of the individual cases.
Chapter Thirteen.
On setting fractures of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpals of the hand and the phalanges of the fingers rarely fracture, but are often bruised.  If the hand does suffer a fracture or bruise, ...
The patient should sit on the floor in a squat position with a chair placed before him.
Then, placing his hand on it stretched out, the bone setter should straighten the fractured bone, and the physician should align it until it is well joined.  Then, if there is no hot swelling, the dressing and splint should be applied, and a brace placed over the area.
And wrap it in a soft cloth. If the fracture is towards the palm of the hand, make a ball-like shape from cloth, and instruct the patient to hold it with their fractured hand, then bind it with a long cloth.
Let the splint be made of soft leather so that the skin heals while accommodating the curvature of the entire hand.  Bind it properly.  If the fracture is outward, a splint should be placed above and another below the hand, to keep the hand open and upright.
Then, the binding should be applied as the hand turns, and the fingers should be connected with a bandage. If the fracture is in one of the fingers, if it is the thumb, align it properly, then bind it with the hand.  If desired, a small upright splint can be used to hold the fracture in place.
Do not move it.  If the fracture is in the other fingers, like the middle, index, ring, or little finger, align them and bind them to the next healthy finger, or bind them all together in sequence, which is better, or place a small upright splint on them.
As we stated concerning the thumb, and examine during and after the setting of the fracture, if there is any heat, treat it as necessary, whenever such things occur, as described repeatedly.
Chapter Fourteen.
In setting the fracture of the thigh.
The thigh bone often breaks and is evident to the touch because it shifts back and forth.  It is set by applying a bandage above the fracture, and another below, with the patient lying on their face.
Then, each attendant pulls the bandage towards their side to straighten it if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. However, if it is near the hip, a soft bandage should be applied, whether of wool or similar material.
At the hip, towards the pubic area, the pull should be upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.  Likewise, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee to pull downwards. Then, the physician should straighten the bone with both hands to return it to its natural form.
And the bone will heal well.  Then, the dressing and traction should be maintained, unless a hot swelling develops on the limb. If a swelling does develop, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to the treatment.
As for the traction, a wide, firm bandage should be wrapped around the fracture two or three times, leaving excess material. Then the leg should be twisted so the heel is at the hip joint.  A long thread should be inserted between the thigh and leg near the knee from below. The ends of the thread should be above and on both sides.
Then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.  Then, apply splints to the thigh, in the location of the fracture itself, and place a single splint on the leg bone.  Fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft cloths to ensure the traction is even.
Then begin with strong traction in the middle, over the fracture site, with three or four wraps.  As you move the bandage further from the fracture site, make the traction less forceful and softer.
Then, take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie the adjacent splints above it.  Then, bring the thread ends down to the heel of the leg, and use them to also tighten the ends of the splints on the other side.
To prevent the bandage from shifting, maintain the traction as long as no sores, swelling, or inflammation appear on the limb. If any of these occur, immediately loosen it and correct any problems that have arisen, as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a splinter protruding from the bone, it should be smoothed if possible. Otherwise, cut around it and remove it. Treat the wound as described previously until it heals.  Sometimes a fracture of the thigh can be treated without including the leg with splints.
As we have mentioned regarding the arm and forearm, applying this type of treatment does not result in lameness for the patient.  However, if the arm is treated alone without incorporating the leg, the patient will inevitably experience lameness.
Know that the thigh heals within fifty days, or slightly more or less, depending on variations in temperament and other circumstances.
Chapter Fifteen.
On fractures of the knee-cap.
The knee-cap rarely fractures, but is often injured. If a fracture does occur, it is either a crack or a fragmentation of its parts, with or without a wound.
The treatment is based on examination, and the fractured parts are brought together with the fingers, as smoothly, gently, and expertly as possible.  Then, a bandage and a circular splint are applied if necessary.
Further, the appropriate bandages are applied, and all the conditions described in other fractures, such as inflammation and similar issues, are addressed, each being treated appropriately until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
In the setting of a fractured leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the ulna.  They are susceptible to the same types of fractures as the arm bones. Therefore, its reduction is like that of the arm, the procedure being the same.  If both bones are fractured, the leg turns in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg turns forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured from below, this is self-evident to you.
Therefore, use extension and straightening and bind the splints accordingly, but if the leg fracture is a severe one with many fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and use more care in setting it.
In the case of the leg, there is an additional procedure beyond that of the arm: once you have straightened the splints and completed all your work, take two pieces of pinewood (used for plastering rooms, or similar palm frond strips).
Choose those of moderate thickness, not thin, and make them the length of the leg from the knee down.  Then, wrap a cloth around each one twice lengthwise. Place one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let them extend from the knee to the bottom of the foot.  Then tie the splints in three places, at the ends and the middle.  With this restraint, the leg will not tilt sideways and will be well supported.  A wooden gutter may also be used along the length of the leg.
Place it in the gutter to prevent movement, especially important if the fracture is accompanied by a wound.  Examine the leg daily, carefully watching for swelling or inflammation or anything else unusual. If any of this occurs, treat it as necessary until healed.  The leg bone will be set within thirty days or thereabouts.
Chapter Seventeen.
On Fractures of the Leg and Fingers.
The heel bone is never fractured; the leg bones may be fractured, and the fingers are rarely fractured, but rather more commonly bruised.
If a fracture of the leg bones occurs and you see the bones are protruding, have the patient stand on the ground with a straight foot, then place your foot on the protruding bones and press down to align them.
Until they are back in their proper places, then take the bandage and splint, place a small, flat board with two flat ends underneath the sole of the foot, and tightly secure the foot with the bandages and other necessary materials.
After three or four days, release the bandage, and you will find the bones aligned, whether they were fractured or dislocated.  The procedure is as described.  If a finger is fractured, realign and straighten it according to the instructions for straightening finger fractures.
Then make a splint for the fractured finger, the length of the finger, and slightly wider than the finger itself.  Then place the board, as described, under the foot, and secure it tightly; if two, three, or more bones are fractured.
Place a splint on each finger, sized according to the finger and wrapped in soft cloth.  Secure the board under the foot; each end of the board should extend beyond the foot to ensure proper support.
You should not forget to treat all fractures with the symptoms we have described, and address each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
Fractures of the woman's pubic bone and the man's pubic bone.
When a woman's vagina is fractured, place her in a squatting position and gradually lean her back slightly. Have her supported from behind, then have the midwife pack her vagina with cotton until it is full and appears like a ball.
Then, the woman should be rocked and her hips raised slightly. This will cause the cotton to be expelled until it resembles a ball at the vaginal opening, and the bone fracture will be healed.  A pad should be placed on her back, and when she wishes to urinate, the cotton should be gently removed so that she can urinate.
Then return it to its original position, as it was initially inserted, and return to the first pad.  Do this for seven days or so, and it will heal. If you wish, take a sheep's bladder, attach a short tube to its opening, and insert the entire bladder into the vagina.
Then blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vagina; the fracture will be healed. Afterward, pack it with cotton and continue the treatment as described previously until it heals.  Similarly, if the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, these methods are employed for its repair.
Its treatment is the same as described for the hip bone.  The correct approach to these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, will be evident to someone with some experience and who understands this book.  Indeed, the fracture itself often provides guidance.
Follow the correct method for its repair and strengthening.  If a man's penis is fractured, take the windpipe of a goose, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it and bind it. Leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the setting of bone fractures if there is a wound.
If a fracture is accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus, or similar, one should promptly perform bloodletting if the conditions for bloodletting, as previously discussed, permit.
If the wound is bleeding, then one should quickly cauterize it by applying powdered alum if nothing else is available. Then, begin setting the fracture on that same day and do not delay.
If no hot swelling occurs, then if a hot swelling does occur, postpone setting the fracture until the ninth day, until the hot swelling subsides. Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth day, as it will be exposed to undesirable symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding and exposed, one should gently attempt to return and align it with one's hands and a slight extension.  If you cannot return and align it with your hands, return it using this instrument, which is made of iron, seven or eight fingers long. And its width should match the size of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should take three or four of them, as needed for treatment in each type of fracture.  Let them be slightly rounded and thick so as not to bend when prodded during use.
It should have a sharp tip with a bend at the tip, thicker at the top and significantly thinner from the middle downwards.  This is its image:.
It is called in Greek *permos*, meaning a small lever.  The sharp, bent tip should be placed on the protruding bone end, and pushed once until the bone is returned to a level alignment, and the fractured ends are aligned.
If the fractured end is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, then the end of that bone should be cut to allow the instrument to hold it properly.  If the bone cannot be realigned as described, then cut it with a similar incision to those previously mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws, as best you can.  Then remove any remaining roughness and thin layers from the bone. If, after aligning the bone, the patient experiences severe, unbearable pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can return it to its natural position, do so, as you will greatly benefit the patient. Once the bone is properly set, dip a cloth in a dark, astringent drink, especially if it is summer, and do not place any ointments or anything greasy on the wound.
So that no putrefaction or decay occurs. Then, utilize splints when finished setting the bone. Leave the wound uncovered by cutting an opening in the dressings with scissors, sized to match the wound.
Beware, with utmost caution, of tightening the wound with the fracture. Often, the ignorant physicians do this, and bring about either death, or ulceration or discharge to their patients.  Let your tightening be gentle and loose, unlike the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or large, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we described, and if the patient experiences troublesome pain in the area, do not apply splints. Instead, make dressings of strong cloths, in the position of the splints, and secure them tightly.
If, after a day or two, you see pus beginning to form in the wound, remove the cloth soaked in the liquid. Then use the bandages and ointments with which we customarily treat wounds, such as the four-fold ointment, and the like.  You should also loosen the bandages.
Examine the wound each evening and morning until it heals and is cured.  The limb should be positioned so that pus drains easily downwards. If the wound takes many days to close and the pus does not stop, know that there are small pieces of bone fragments.
Then you should probe the wound.  Remove any detached fragments, and any fragments that remain unseparated, and pierce the limb, causing pain, then cut and remove them in any way you can.
If the wound shows signs of cold, ulceration, or other forms of corruption or putrefaction, you should treat each symptom with the corresponding remedy described in its respective section.
If a large, prominent bone such as the femur or humerus, or similar large bones, is fractured, do not attempt to pull or remove it. Often death results from this; instead, leave it until it rots.  Perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it.

On treating the suppuration which occurs after some fractures.
This suppuration often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially near the joints.  It disfigures the limb and may prevent the limb from its natural function.
If the suppuration is fresh, use astringent medicines such as frankincense, myrrh,  henna, acacia, and the like, taking some or all of these and mixing them with a styptic liquid, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply this to the suppuration with meticulousness, firmly bandaging it, leaving the bandage on for many days, then removing it and repeating the application until the suppuration is gone, God willing, or by applying a tight lead plate.
Lead has the property of removing all that which is suppurative in the limbs.  If the suppuration has hardened and become severe, and necessity dictates its removal, make an incision at the top and cut or scrape away the excess pus until it is gone. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In treating a fracture, if the limb is subsequently slender and not in its original form.
If a fractured bone is set and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this can have many causes. One cause may be excessive loosening and improper binding of the ligaments; or excessive tightening of the ligaments, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or excessive and improper manipulation; or excessive movements at inappropriate times; or a deficiency and weakness of blood in the patient's body.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and strengthen their body so that their blood increases, using baths, bringing joy and happiness, and similar measures.  Then, apply asphalt to the limb to draw much nourishment to it, or continue its manipulation with lukewarm water. Until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of fractured bones that have been rejoined crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
If a limb, after being set, shows crookedness or a protuberance of the broken bone, or entanglement, and the appearance of the limb is thus unsightly. However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then one should not accept the claim of those who say to break the limb from the head, and many ignorant physicians and setters do this in our country.
This action is highly reprehensible and leads to great risk, and the least of which is injury.  But if the crookedness and entanglement are recent, it is appropriate to bathe with water that has cooked herbs that relax, such as mallow leaves and root, and crown flower and the like.
And apply relaxing bandages, such as carefully made diachylon, or take the sap of the mallow root, mix it with chicken fat and butter, and apply as a dressing, or take ripe figs, grind them with pigeon droppings and similar remedies known as resolvents of inflammation.
And the entanglement may be resolved with constant gentle massage by hand, and the limb is moved in all directions at all times. If the crookedness is old, severe, and hardened, and treatment with iron is necessary.
Then it is necessary to cut above it, release the bone connection, and cut any excess entanglement or bone with finer cuts, using gentleness and care. Then treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is a dislocation of a joint from its position, hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing the patient severe pain and suffering.  Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, one must promptly attempt to restore it.
Do not delay it at all; if delayed, the area swells and becomes a mass, making restoration of the jaw difficult.  Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor moved, nor stretched while it is swollen, for it often causes the patient painful spasms and suffering.
However, if this occurs, the patient should first be bled, then allowed to rest until the swelling subsides somewhat.  Then, the limb should be bathed with warm water and ointment, and the jaw gently restored.  Each limb should be treated as described in its respective section.
The chapters on the jaw are also arranged, as was done with fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the lower jaw.
The jaws dislocate rarely.  Their dislocation is of two types: either they move slightly from their place, becoming somewhat relaxed, or they completely and entirely dislocate until they are relaxed. To the chest, until the patient's saliva flows and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue is unable to speak.  If the dislocation is slight, however, it will often return to its place quite easily.
If the dislocation is complete, the repositioning must be expedited and not delayed.  A servant should hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
Or he should insert both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and the rest of his fingers should be used externally to align it.  He should instruct the patient to relax his jaw and allow it to move in any direction.  The physician should then align the jaw and push it until it returns to its place.
If repositioning is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved, apply a warm water compress and ointment to ease the repositioning.  Do not delay repositioning, as we have said.  Once the jaws have returned to their proper position, and the patient's mouth is closed and no longer relaxed, then apply bandages made from linen with a plaster composed of wax, ointment, and rose petals.
Then gently bind it with a loose bandage. The patient should sleep on their back with their head propped up between two pillows, so as not to move it to the right or left, or to chew anything. Instead, their food should be soft and easily consumed.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw has healed, the patient may eat as they please.  They should use gentle care and not force their mouth open while eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw has healed and the injury is completely recovered.
If the jaws, having been dislocated at some point, do not return to their proper position, frequent fevers, constant headaches, and possibly abdominal discomfort and repeated vomiting may occur.  If you see this, know that the condition is severe.
Often, those who experience this condition for ten days die.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On the reduction of the clavicle and shoulder joint.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inside due to its connection to the chest. It may dislocate outward, which is apparent to the touch.  To reduce it, the patient should lie on their back with their arms outstretched.
Then press firmly on the area with your hand; it will return. Then apply a bandage and splints, and secure them.  As for its end near the shoulder, to which it is connected, it does not usually dislocate. If it does, it should be reduced and aligned as described, as best you can.
Then apply a bandage, splints, and a tight wrap, and instruct the patient to remain still and quiet until healed.  With this same treatment, the shoulder joint can be reduced if it also dislocates.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In reducing the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one is toward the armpit, downward; the second is toward the chest; and the third, rarely, is upward, away from the shoulder.
It does not dislocate behind the shoulder blade or in front of the nerve.  Most often, it dislocates and comes out downward toward the armpit, particularly in those with little muscle because it comes out and goes in quickly in them.
However, in those with a lot of muscle, it is the opposite; that is, it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty.  Sometimes, a person may experience a blow or fall, causing the shoulder to swell and become hot.  They may think it is dislocated.  It is necessary to examine this carefully to determine its true condition.
Then, in treating it, if the dislocation is downward toward the armpit, when you place the dislocated shoulder next to the healthy one, you will find a clear difference.  You will find a distortion in the head of the dislocated shoulder.  And under the armpit, when touching, the head of the dislocated shoulder feels like an egg.
And the patient cannot raise their arm to their ear, nor perform any other movements.  Similarly, if it dislocated toward the chest or upward, you will find this obvious by touching, and it is not hidden.
This dislocation may be easily reduced if it is fresh or if the patient is a child.  To reduce it, have an attendant raise the arm upwards.  Then, place your thumbs under the armpit and raise the joint firmly upwards to its proper place.  The attendant should raise and extend the arm upwards.
Then, lower it downwards.  It will return quickly. If it does not return by the method described, and the dislocation has been present for many days, the patient should bathe in warm water and use remedies that loosen and soften, such as boiled  *al-khatmi* (marshmallow root), fenugreek, and *iklil al-malik* (king's crown) in water, and apply these.
Then, the patient lies on their back, and a ball of wool of moderate firmness is placed under their armpit.  The physician then places their heel on the ball, and holds the patient's hand and extends it downwards.
And the physician pushes the ball with their foot, and it returns to its place.  Or, if you wish, reduce it in this way: have a man taller than the patient stand on the side.  He places his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises their armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. Another attendant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards their stomach. If the patient is light, something should be attached to weigh them down.  This will cause the joint to return immediately.  Other methods of reduction may also be employed.
Another method is to place a long, round-headed wooden board on the ground, similar to a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin.  A soft cloth is placed on the head of the board, and the patient stands along the board's length, and the board is placed under the patient's armpit.
Then, the patient extends their hand downwards on the opposite side, and also extends their body forcefully on the other side.  The joint will return to its proper place quickly.  If reduction is difficult using all the methods previously described, use this treatment: take a piece of wood approximately two cubits long. Its width should be about four fingers and its thickness about two fingers.  It should have a round head to easily enter the depth of the armpit, like this:
Then, a soft cloth is tied to the round head to prevent the board from injuring the patient. The board is placed under the armpit. The entire hand and arm are extended downward along the board. The board is fastened to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then, the arm is placed on a crossbar. The arm is extended downward, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the opposite side. The joint will then enter its place immediately.  If it has entered in any way possible, a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then, a dressing prepared from mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the entire shoulder, moving from the top downward.  The ball is tightly secured under the armpit.  A bandage is wrapped around the dressing from above. The hand is then suspended by tying it to the neck.
The hand should remain immobile for seven days.  The patient's diet should be kept light to strengthen the affected limb, for this hastens recovery.  Then, after seven or five days, the bandage is removed and the patient is encouraged to move the arm. If it remains firm and does not relax, the injury is healed.
If the joint frequently dislocates due to moisture or another cause, cauterization with three small cauterizing instruments should be applied, as described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the joint still does not hold,
If the bandage and pressure are repeated many times, and the joint still does not hold, dislocating and relaxing, and the arm cannot be raised, know that the nerve in the shoulder area is severed or stretched or relaxed.  Then know that the joint will never return to its proper position.
For a dislocated jaw, which is near the chest and breast, and behind the head, return it by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to its place.  Use all other methods of bandaging and treatment until it heals.  If after healing, the limb feels numb or its movement is slow,
The patient should use a hot bath frequently to soften the numbness and restore it to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the treatment of a dislocated elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty.  It dislocates in all directions, especially forward or backward. Its dislocation is not hidden from you, as it is under observation and touch, so you can tell precisely how it has dislocated.
If you compare the dislocated elbow to the healthy one, the dislocation will be clearly apparent by the hollowing of the joint.  The arm cannot be bent, nor can the shoulder be placed against it.  You should act quickly to relocate the dislocation before a hot swelling appears.
If a hot swelling appears, its relocation will be difficult, and it may not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backward.  This is the worst of all dislocations, the most painful, and often leads to death.
If it is possible to relocate it, a helper should extend his arms, and the physician's hands should be positioned above and below the elbow. The helper pushes on the joint with both thumbs or the base of his palms until it returns to its proper position.
If the dislocation is forward, the hand may be bent once until its palm strikes the shoulder opposite it.  If the dislocation does not return, use extremely strong traction.  Two helpers should pull on the arm.
Two helpers also hold the patient to prevent displacement during traction.  Then the arm is rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or wide bandage around it.  If the physician is working with his hands on the joint, he should lubricate it with ointment to facilitate the smooth repositioning of the joint.
Then the joint is pushed forcefully until it returns.  After it returns, a bandage with a compressive and drying agent (like egg white) should be applied tightly, and the arm should be suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then it is removed.  If the joint is firmly in place, remove the bandage and leave it.  If you see the joint is not yet firm, reapply the bandage and support, and leave it for several more days until it firms up.  Then remove it. If swelling occurs after the joint has returned and the bandage is removed.
If movement is difficult, use moist heat in a bath, gentle massage, and rubbing until it softens.  Or, place a thick, fatty sheep's fleece on the joint, bandage it, and leave it in place for a day and a night.  Then remove it and put him in a bath.  If he sweats, massage the joint gently.
Then repeat the sheep's fleece application one, two, and three times, along with baths, until it softens.  If you prefer, apply dampened, finely ground cow dung mixed with butter and bandage it.  Do this several times, and it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist frequently dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints. However, it is necessary to promptly reduce the dislocation the moment it occurs, before inflammation or a hot swelling develops in the area.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board.  A servant should extend their hand, and the physician should place their hand on the prominence of the joint and push until it returns.  However, one must check whether the dislocation has moved to the palm side of the hand.
Let the patient place the back of their hand on the board during extension and reduction. If the dislocation is prominent on the back of the hand, then let the palm of their hand rest on the board so that the physician's hand is on the same prominence of the joint.  If it returns immediately, then fine. Otherwise, apply a bandage that relieves inflammation.
Leave it be; do not attempt to reduce it again.  After a few days, you cannot reduce it, and the joint will remain crooked, without harming the patient, except that the hand will become weak and unable to grasp anything.
At that point, you will know that the nerve is severed or compressed; there is no remedy except to tie it, perhaps it will help, or perhaps not.  Once the wrist is reduced, apply the bandage we described, then tie it tightly, and leave it for five days.
Then, the bandage is removed, and the hand is exercised.  If its movement is difficult, and some stiffness is apparent, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction.  If a finger dislocates to the back or palm of the hand, straighten the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumb until it returns to place, then bandage the finger head and support it in the direction it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and stretch it until it stands upright that day. If it is in the evening, bandage it in the same manner. Continue to loosen the bandage during the day and exercise the movement, and bandage it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
And do the same if it dislocates to the palm of the hand, bandaging it towards that same direction.  Do the same as your initial treatment until it heals; do likewise if it dislocates in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
In treating the dislocation of the vertebrae.
When a vertebra in the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment because death quickly comes to the afflicted person.
A sign of this is that the afflicted person's stool is expelled involuntarily; they cannot retain it.  Often, some of their limbs, either their legs or arms or one of them, become relaxed.  If only one vertebra is displaced, it often slips further.
Its displacement can occur in four directions.  That which displaces backward is called a hump.  There is no treatment for a hump that developed from childhood, and no cure at all.  However, for one that resulted from a fall, a blow, or something similar...
The ancients have described various treatments with lengthy explanations, most of which are of little use.  I have condensed this into a smaller amount, sufficient for a considerable portion of what they presented, clarifying the meaning and illustrating the mechanics differently than they described and explained.
I say that a hump that develops in the front of the chest is untreatable and incurable, as is one to the sides.  However, treatment is possible for those that occur in the back, specifically by the method I describe:  the afflicted person should be placed on their face.
On a level platform near a wall, a moist mat should be spread beneath to prevent the chest from being injured. Then a vertical board, embedded in a hole in the ground, is placed near his head, and another board near his feet, at the other end of the platform.
A servant holds the board, not fastened in the hole, and another servant holds the other, in the same manner.  Then a soft, tight bandage is wrapped around the patient's chest and under their armpits. The end of the bandage is extended to the board near the head and tied to it.
Then another bandage is tightened over his hips, knees, and ankles.  Then all the bandages are gathered and tied to the other board near his feet.  Each servant pulls the board in their direction with the bandages, and the boards remain in their embedded positions.
However, the boards are not fastened, as we said. The physician places his hands firmly on the hump to restore it, or he places a board on it, then leans on the board with his feet until it returns.  If this treatment does not work, take a board about three cubits long.
A cavity is dug in the wall, near the patient, where the end of the board fits. Then the middle of the board is placed on the hump. The physician places his feet on the other end and pulls firmly to compress the hump.
And it returns to its place.  If you wish, you can do this with a hand-wound coil, by planting two boards a cubit long in the ground at the patient's head and another two at their feet, at the ends of the shop.
Place a span between each board. A hole is made in each board for the coil to pass through.  All the boards are firmly anchored to the ground to prevent movement. A rounded stick, the winding coil, is placed inside the holes in the boards, then the bandage is wound around it.
At the end of it [the coil] is a hole where a stick a span long, to be wound, is secured.  The same is done for the other two boards. Then, the bandage tied around the patient's chest is tightened on the coil by the head, and the bandages on the legs are tightened on the coil by the feet.
Then, a servant stands by each coil, twisting the coil with the winding tool.  The physician adjusts the hump as previously described.  This is a picture of the coil, the shop, and the patient.
Then, after the protrusion returns and the area is aligned, the dried bandage should be applied, followed by a poultice.  Then, a splint made of wood, whose width is about three fingers or so and whose length covers the hump, should be placed over the bandage.
And place some sound beads upon it.  Then tie with the necessary bandage, and the patient should eat soft food until cured.  If some protuberance remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then one should use the softening and relaxing remedies, along with the splint described, for a considerable time.
A lead plate may also be used in this case.  If a protrusion appears at the end of the back beads, it may be mistaken for dislocation.  This might be an extra bone that has protruded.  Do not treat it with this therapy, for it might cause death.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and not to the slight displacement and concavity that affects other joints.  The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
This is because it dislocates inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards.  It dislocates inwards most often, and rarely forwards or backwards.  A sign of dislocation inwards is that if you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg will be longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will not be able to bend their leg at the groin.  The area next to the groin will be swollen and distinctly swollen, showing that the head of the thigh bone has moved there.
The signs of dislocation outwards are the opposite of these signs.  The sign of dislocation forward is that the patient can fully extend the leg, but cannot bend it without pain in the knee.  If they try to walk, they cannot do so forward.
The patient will have difficulty urinating and the groin will be painful.  When walking, the patient will place their weight on the heel.  A sign of dislocation backward is that the patient cannot straighten the knee or bend it before bending the groin, and the leg will also be shorter than the other.
The groin will be relaxed, and the head of the thigh bone will be clearly visible near the hip area.  As for the treatment of these dislocations, if the dislocation has been present for some time and the patient has not attempted to reduce it, and it remains in its current state, then there is no cure.
Therefore, it should not be allowed to occur.  For a recently dislocated joint, regardless of whether it's one of the four types of dislocation, attempt to rotate the joint, extending it inward and outward, and moving it right and left, for it may...
If it returns without further treatment, then if it doesn't return this way, one should prepare a strong assistant who will extend the leg from below, either with their hands or with a bandage tied above the knee, and another assistant will extend it from above.
By placing their hands under his armpits, then tightening a soft bandage around the upper thigh, a third assistant will hold the end of the bandage, and the extension will be either in front from the groin towards the collarbone, or from behind towards the back.
All of them will pull simultaneously until the patient's body is lifted from the ground and remains suspended.  This type of extension is common to all four types of dislocation. If the dislocation returns as we have described, then otherwise, each type requires its own specific treatment.
For its specific return if the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on their sound side, then a bandage should be placed on the upper thigh, between the head of the thigh and the area below the groin.
Then the bandage is pulled upward from the groin toward the upper body, towards the collarbone.  Then a strong assistant, with both arms, grasps the thick part of the affected thigh and pulls outwards with great force, and it will return to its place.
This type is easier than other methods of returning this limb.  If you are unable to achieve its re-entry with this treatment method, then you should tie both of the patient's legs with a strong, soft bandage around both ankles and knees.
Each bandage should be approximately four finger-widths apart.  The affected leg should be extended further than the other by two finger-widths.  The patient should be suspended from the head by a wooden beam in the house, with the beam positioned at a height of approximately two arm-lengths from the ground.
Then a strong boy should grasp the head of the thigh, and another boy should hold onto the patient.  The boy holding the thigh should push with force, and the joint will quickly return to its proper place.  And for its specific return, if the dislocation is outward...
The patient should lie on a bed, as described for the patient with a hump, and the bandage should be tightened around his affected leg and chest.  Then, two beams should be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head.  A further beam should be placed firmly in the middle of the bed.
Damp cloths should be wrapped around it to prevent harm to the patient.  The beam should be placed between the patient's thighs, to prevent downward displacement during stretching.  Then each attendant should pull in their direction, and the physician should align the hip with his hands.  If it returns to its place...
Otherwise, place the board upon him and compress it, as we described for the humpback, except that the patient must lie on his healthy side.  If the dislocation is forward, the patient's leg must be stretched while in this same position on the bed.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected groin, then presses it with his other hand.  At the same time, the pressure should be extended downward towards the knee.  If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be stretched downward.
He should not be elevated from the ground, but rather placed on a firm surface.  Also, his hip and thigh should be rotated outward, as we described from his lying on the bed on his face with the bandages tight.
As we said before, compression with the board should also be applied to the area where the joint has dislocated.  When the hip joint returns properly, a clear sign, which you should know, is that the patient's legs can be stretched.
If you see both legs are even, and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned to its proper place.  Then, align the thighs, apply the bandage, and secure it with a turban.  Make sure the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient should remain at rest for three or four days.  Then, remove the bandage and dressing, and compare the legs. If you find that they are of equal size, know that the fracture has healed. Allow the patient to walk. However, if you see any sign of weakness, [do not allow walking yet].
Return and bandage it again, tightening it as you did initially.  Leave it for another three days.  Then, remove it and have the patient walk slowly for a few days until the limb is strong again, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On the treatment of a fractured knee.
The knee can fracture in three ways: inwards, outwards, and downwards (i.e., backwards). It does not fracture forwards. A sign of a fractured knee is to instruct the patient to press their leg against their thigh.
If the leg does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is fractured. To treat all types of fractures: the patient should sit, extending their legs if able, with an assistant behind them holding their middle and slightly bending them backwards. Then, you should sit on their thighs.
Lean your back against their body, place their leg between your legs, then grasp their knee with both hands, interlocking your fingers on it.  Press firmly with both hands on the sides of the knee. A second assistant should extend the leg until the knee returns to its position.
A sign that it has returned to its place is that the leg will adhere to the thigh, softly and without force. Then bandage them together, and secure the leg to the thigh with a bandage for three or four days, then remove it. Only allow light walking for a few days until strength returns.
If you cannot return it with the method described, then use strong traction with the bandages previously described for treating the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may dislocate slightly or completely.  Its dislocation can be either inward or outward.  A sign of dislocation is that the heel appears swollen and prominent on the side to which it has dislocated.
As for treating a slight displacement, it is easy to return it by gently pulling and aligning it until it returns.  However, if it is completely dislocated, the patient should sit, and a strong servant should hold him from behind in the middle of his back.
Then, using your right hand, grasp the top of his foot, and with your left hand, grasp the bottom of the foot at the ankle.  Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left, twice.  Then, push the front of the foot towards the leg with your right hand, and extend it with your left, without force.
Repeat this twice as described.  Then, in the third time, push the front of the foot towards the leg while pulling the heel.  If it returns in one or two attempts and you see the foot is aligned, then stop.  Otherwise, repeat the procedure, as it will return.
If it does not return with the method described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground.  Securely place a firmly planted wooden stake between his thighs, wrapped in cloth to prevent injury.  Then have a servant secure the patient's thigh.
Then another servant extends the leg, either with their hands or with a bandage tied around the patient's neck.  Each servant should pull in the opposite direction.  The wooden stake remains positioned between the patient's thighs, holding him steady to prevent his body from falling during the extension.  Then the physician aligns the joint with their hands.
Another servant holds the healthy leg down, for if the joint returns quickly, it is correct.  If the joint returns and its return is confirmed, then take the bandage and splint and secure them tightly with bandages.  Tie the foot with the bandage downward.  Be mindful of the nerve that lies above the heel from behind.
So that the bandage is not too tight and causes pain, then leave it for two or three days.  If the bandage loosens, tighten it, then release it on the third or fourth day.  The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, there is a risk that the joint will dislocate and be irreparably damaged, and subsequent treatment will not be successful.  If a hot swelling appears, use the treatments described previously in other parts of the treatment and healing, until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocated toes.
One should gently realign the dislocated toes by a slight stretch, without force, which is easily accomplished.  If the dislocation is in one of the toes of the foot, the patient should place their foot on a level surface.
Or, while standing like a walker, place your foot on the protruding joint and press it with your foot firmly until it returns to its proper position, and you see no protrusion at the site.
Then, place a board under the sole of their foot that encompasses the entire foot, having two ends.  Tie it firmly for three days.  Then loosen it and keep the patient from walking for many days until it strengthens, and a recurrence is avoided, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation that occur with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both.
When such a thing occurs, and you attempt to treat and manipulate it, death often follows.
Therefore, only a skilled surgeon, experienced, gentle, compassionate, careful, and not rash or reckless, should undertake the treatment of such a case.  Initially, they should use only medications to alleviate the inflammatory swelling and allow the patient to recover.
By God's grace, except for cases where you hope for the patient's recovery from harm with mild illness and some hope appears, then return [the treatment] at once, in the beginning, before the inflammatory swelling occurs.
If the member returns as desired, use the treatment that relieves inflammatory swellings and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments. If the dislocation is associated with a fracture and detached fragments have occurred in the bone, then remove them. Follow in this regard what we have mentioned regarding simple diseases in the preceding sections.
Strive diligently and purify yourself from entering the path of uncertainty, as previously advised.  That will preserve your reputation and safeguard your presentation, God willing.
