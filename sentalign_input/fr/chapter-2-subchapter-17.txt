About the flesh that grows on the pupil
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows, and it covers the pupil and tightens on the eyelids and turns them outward, and it looks like a pomegranate flower; and the procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and gathers all that flesh with suitable hooks, and holds it with force; then cut the first flesh, and continue cutting with the razor until the end, and be careful not to injure the eye in the procedure; and let the incision be made with the spatula that we have mentioned in the incision of the nail and with small scissors, as shown in the form after this chapter;
and when the incision is completed and all the flesh is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt or distill red eyewash and similar corrosive medicines, and place cotton soaked in egg white on the eye, so that it is protected from a hot abscess; and if anything remains, and hot blood rises, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with soothing substances for hot abscesses; then return to your procedure until it is healed, and do the same when flesh is added to the eye in this manner.
But always, you must adjust the treatment of each weak eye according to the natural way; and the accidental way, with the work of iron; and do not place your hand in any of these procedures until you see that the members can endure that procedure.
