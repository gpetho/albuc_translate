Chapter Thirty-Six on Cauterizing the Fistula that Occurs in the Anus and its Surroundings
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure that we described in its place and is afraid of it, then perhaps he will recover with cauterization.
So if a fistula occurs in someone and becomes chronic, pus and corrupted fluids flow from it, then the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then know the extent of its depth with the probe.
Then heat the cauterizing iron that resembles the probe.
Then insert it hot into the fistula itself, aligned with the depth of the fistula and the extent to which the probe entered.
And repeat the cauterization until all those corrupted tissues are burned, once or twice or thrice, according to your need.
And beware of burning a nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein.
And if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine, then beware of all these places.
And you only do that if the fistula is in a fleshy place and you estimate that it is not perforated.
Then treat the area until it heals.
If the area seals and the discharge stops from it and remains so for a while, then know that it has completely healed.
And if the discharge does not stop from it, then know that it is perforated or there is a corrupted bone in its depth, or something similar to that, which will be mentioned in its place.
