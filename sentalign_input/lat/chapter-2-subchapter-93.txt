On the incision for the disease Nakir.
Chapter 95.
This disease is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then shifts from one limb to another.
And I have indeed seen it, as I will tell you.
I was called to an ailing woman in a certain village.
She uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm cord.
After remaining there for an hour, I saw a swelling moving along like a worm, ascending to her shoulder faster than can be believed, like quicksilver running from one place to another.
The pain then left that area and became fixed in the shoulder.
Then, after sitting for another hour, it ran into the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it moved throughout her whole body, as I had seen.
I was amazed at the speed of its movement from one limb to another.
I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner before.
However, I have seen many who experience pain moving from limb to limb, though I had not seen it with my eyes as I did in this woman.
And I do not think this is the case unless it is because the woman was from those villages of people with dry bodies and exposed veins; thus, this shifting windiness appears to the senses.
And it is necessary that this does not appear in those who are indulgent, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
Therefore, when you wish to treat it and the patient feels the pain, if it is visible to you, as we have said, then bind tightly above and below it quickly; make an incision over it until the confined windiness exits, and cauterize the area.
But if it is not visible to your eyes, then treat it with body evacuation, and with what expels windiness, and soothes it with foul-smelling pills and pills of serapinum, and the like.
