Chapter Seventy-Eight.
On extracting the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with white hellebore, and tightly close her mouth and nostrils with your hand. If it comes out with this, then fine. Otherwise, take a measure.
Pierce a hole in the lid, and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as rue, oregano, dill, chamomile, wormwood, savory, and centaury. All of these medications, or some of them, immerse them in water, and place them on the fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then make her sneeze as we said, for the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage.
Then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta with it. If she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it little by little until she extracts it. If it is adhered deep in the womb, insert the hand as we described, so that when you find the placenta, pull it little by little, gently.
Lest the womb fall out with strong pulling, rather it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then increase the amount of pulling, for then it will respond and be released from the adhesion. If the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment of the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, beware of violence in pulling it again, but it should be tied to what has come out of it at the mouth of the womb to the woman's thigh, then inject her with the quadruple ointment, for it will rot it after a few days.
And it dissolves and comes out, except that when it rots, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and this harms the patient, so it is necessary to use suitable fumigations.
For that, some of the ancients tried fumigation with the herb and dried figs.  Image of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated when there is retention of menses, placenta, and so on:
It is made of lead resembling a funnel, or it is made of copper.  The thin end is placed in the vulva and the wide end over the fire, and the incense is placed on the coals. She holds it until that incense is gone, and repeats with another.
