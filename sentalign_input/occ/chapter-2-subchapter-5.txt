Chapter 5.
On the treatment of tears from catarrh and those descending to the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone has acute and continuous catarrh, and sometimes the patient's eyes are strained, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids ulcerated and losing their eyelashes, and there is sharp pain in the head and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the matter and catarrh come from many veins of the internal parts.
And the best treatment for them is this: instruct the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, slightly across the width (and start with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be to the bone; and extend your hand away from the nerves of the temples which are damaged towards the chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth and then fill between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton or linen cloths.
Then tighten above with powders soaked in wine and oil so that no hot abscess occurs.
And when you untie this and see that the abscess has already diminished, then rub the bone until flesh starts to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen that makes the flesh grow, as if you take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony and mix it, and make a plaster from it and apply it to these wounds until the flesh grows naturally.
