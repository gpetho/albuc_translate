The author of this book, when completing this book for you, my children, which is a complete part of the science of medicine, and reaching its peak in clarity and explanation, saw fit to complete it for you with this chapter, which is a part of practical application.
Because practical application, in our country and in our time, is entirely lacking, so much so that its study almost ceased and its trace vanished. But only a few traces of it remain in the books of the ancients, which have been distorted by hands, affected by error and confusion, until its meanings were obscured and its benefits distanced.
So I saw fit to revive it and compose this chapter on the path of explanation, elucidation, and summarization, and to present illustrations of cauterizing irons and all other tools of practice, as this is part of increased explanation and a compilation of what is needed.
The reason there is no skilled practitioner with a skillful hand in our time is that the art of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first exert themselves in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen. So that he may understand the benefits of the organs, their constitutions, humors, connections, and separations, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number, exits, arteries, veins, both pulsing and stagnant, and the locations of their exits.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the practical art.  We have mentioned a portion of this in the introduction to this book.
Because whoever is not knowledgeable about the anatomy we have mentioned is likely to make a fatal mistake, as I have seen many who presume to know this science without knowledge or understanding.
For I have seen an ignorant physician cut into a pig-like tumor on a woman's neck, severing some of the neck's arteries, so the woman bled to death before his eyes.
And I have seen another physician, in attempting to remove a stone from an elderly man,  boldly removed it with a piece of the bladder tissue. The man died about three days later.  I was called to remove it, and, having seen the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I assessed the risks.
And I saw another physician who made his living practicing medicine among the leaders of our town.
A dark-skinned boy with a fracture near his heel and a wound,  the physician, in his ignorance, quickly tightened the splint and bandages around the wound, compressing it firmly and not allowing the wound to breathe.
Then, he acted according to his desires, left it for days, and told him not to loosen the bandages until his leg and foot swelled, and he was on the brink of death.
I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandages.  He found relief and was free from his pain, but the damage had already taken hold in the limb, and I was unable to prevent it.
The damage continued to spread in the limb until he died.
I saw another physician treat a boil or cancerous tumor.  After a few days, it ulcerated, and his condition worsened.  This is because, if the cancer is purely from a black humor, it should never be treated with iron.
Unless it is in a limb that can be completely removed.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two categories: work that is accompanied by safety and work that, in most cases, results in harm.
And I have warned, in every place where this book describes work with risk and fear, that you should beware and reject it.
So that the ignorant will not find an opening to speak ill or criticize, adopt firmness and caution for yourselves, and gentleness and careful consideration for your patients.
Employ the best path leading to safety and a favorable outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure illnesses.
Keep yourselves clear of anything that you fear might cast doubt on your religion and your worldly affairs, for this will be the most enduring means to elevate your status and raise your standing in this world and the Hereafter.
Galen, in some of his precepts, said: "Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called a bad physician.
This article has been divided into three chapters.
The first chapter.
The chapter on cauterization with fire and with sharp remedies, arranged from the heel to the foot, including images of the instruments, cautery irons, and everything necessary for manual work.
And the second chapter.
On incision, lancing, bloodletting, cupping, surgery, extraction of arrows, and the like, all arranged and with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third chapter.
On fracture, dislocation, treatment of sprains, and the like, arranged from the heel to the foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first chapter.
On cauterization.
Before mentioning the procedure, it is necessary to discuss its benefits, drawbacks, and in which temperament it is used.
Thus I say that discussing the benefits and drawbacks of cauterization is a lengthy matter, a precise science, and a hidden secret. Many wise men have spoken on it.
And they differed. I have condensed their few words, fearing length.
I say that cauterization generally benefits every bad temperament, whether with matter or without, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without matter, and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they differed. Some said that cauterization is beneficial, while others said the opposite—that cauterization is not suitable in a disease arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured of a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry remedy.  The one who says the opposite claims that cauterization with fire can benefit from a hot, dry disease that occurs in people's bodies. Because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the human body cold.
And I say as he says, because experience has revealed this to me many times.  However, this matter should only be considered by those who have diligently and extensively practiced the art of cauterization. And he has understood the differences in people's temperaments, the nature of illnesses themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially cold, damp diseases.  All physicians agree on them, and they do not disagree on the benefit of cauterization in these cases.
And know, my children, that the secret of cauterization with fire, and its superiority over cauterization with burning medicines, lies in this: fire is a single essence whose action is confined to the part cauterized, and it does not harm another connected part except to a slight degree.
Cauterization with burning medicines may extend its effect to adjacent parts and perhaps cause a difficult-to-treat disease, or even death, in the affected part.  Fire, due to its nobility and the excellence of its essence, does not do this unless it is excessive.
This has become clear to us through experience, due to our long service and careful attention to the craft, and our understanding of the facts.
For this reason, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse, although, were it not inappropriate for this book, I would present to you a profound secret about fire, its action on bodies, and its efficacy in treating diseases with a precise philosophical and demonstrative argument that would be beyond your comprehension.
Know, my children, that they differ concerning the time best suited for cauterization, considering spring to be the most favorable time.
I say that cauterization may be appropriate in any season, since the harm caused by the season is overcome by the benefit derived from the cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for a severe, pressing, and dangerous ailment that cannot be delayed, lest a greater harm follow than the slight damage caused by the season.
Do not, my children, imagine what the common people and ignorant physicians suppose, that a cauterization which cures a disease will never recur, and that it is a definitive cure.
And this is not as you suppose, for cauterization is like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries the moisture which is the cause of the ailments.
However, cauterization is superior to medication in its swift success, strong action, and intense power.
Yet the illness may return at some time, depending on the patient's temperament, the strength of the disease, its potency, and the accumulation of humors within the body, and negligence in acquiring appropriate nourishment and similar causes.
Except that the illness for which cauterization is used is a mild one and in a part of the body with little humors and moisture. For example, cauterizing a tooth for pain, and similar cases, the pain may not return, and this will be at least the case.
Also, the common saying that cauterization is the final recourse in medicine is a correct statement, not in the way they think, because they believe there is no cure that will help after cauterization, whether medicinal or otherwise. The matter is different.
The meaning of "cauterization is the final recourse in medicine" is that when we have used various treatments for a disease, and those medicines were ineffective, and then we use cauterization last and it is successful, then in this case, cauterization is the final recourse in medicine. Not in the sense understood by the common people and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients stated that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron. They said this because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its substance, and they said that the cauterized area does not become inflamed. However, this is not universally true.
Because I have tested it and found that it only does that in some bodies, and not in others. Cauterization with it is better and more excellent than with iron, as they said, except that if you heat the gold cautery in fire, you will not be able to determine when it is heated to the desired degree of gold's redness.
Because cold quickly affects it, and if you increase its heat in the fire, it melts and fuses, causing the artisan to waste effort.  Therefore, cauterization with iron is quicker and closer to being correct in practice, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections, ordered from head to foot, to make it easier for the student to find what he needs, God willing.
Chapter One.
Cauterization of the head; single cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for excessive moisture and cold in the brain, which are causes of headaches, frequent colds from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleepiness, toothache, and throat pain. In general, for all diseases caused by coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and stupor, and similar illnesses.
The method of this cauterization is to first instruct the patient to induce vomiting with a purgative medicine, which is good for the head, for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habits of the patient.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor, then have him sit before you, squatting, with his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose, between his eyes.  Wherever your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-wood cautery, which is illustrated like this.
If the bone has been exposed to the extent of a needle's head or a carob seed, lift your hand. Otherwise, reheat the same iron, or another if it has cooled. Until you see the bone as I described, then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a piece of cotton in it. Place it on the affected area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton ball soaked in clarified butter, leaving it until the burning sensation from the cautery subsides. Then treat with the four-part ointment until healed, God willing.
They say that the longer a wound remains open, the more it discharges pus, and that this is better and more beneficial.
Some have said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery held until some of the bone's thickness is burned.  Then, the burned bone should be scraped away, and the wound treated afterward.
Others said that the cauterization should be forceful, impacting the bone strongly, until it flakes off like a small piece of quartz or a small granule. They claimed that this releases the head's vapor from the area and that the wound should be kept open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals. I do not at all consider these two types of cauterization except in some people and by way of risk.  Leaving it be is better for me, and good health comes from this, for the head weakens if its natural connections are broken up as we have seen in other organs.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion.  Use it and you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
On cauterization of the head as well.
If a chronic pain occurs throughout the head and this persists in the patient, and if poultices, cataplasms, floggings, ointments, and bandages have been used, especially if the single cauterization we described has been applied and nothing has helped, then consider... If the patient's head is strong by nature and not weak, and experiences severe cold, cauterize again a little higher than the previous one. Then cauterize each horn of his head, until the thickness of the skin recedes and the amount of bone we described is exposed. Cauterize a spot at the back of his head, in the area known as the "axe," and be gentle here, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will feel intense pain, unlike the pain of all other head cauterizations. I will describe this cauterization in its appropriate place.
The cautery used for the horns and back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used for the middle of the head.  This is its depiction.
Chapter Three.
In cauterizing chronic suppuration.
If pain occurs in the head wound, accompanied by headache, and the pain extends to the eye, the patient should be purged with medicines that cleanse the head, and use all the other treatments I have mentioned in the sections on diseases. If this is unsuccessful, there are two ways to cauterize it. Either by cautery with a sharp, burning medicine, or by iron.
As for cautery with the burning medicine, take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends. Then cut the painful area on the temple with a broad scalpel until a space is created beneath the skin to accommodate the clove.
Insert it under the skin until it disappears. Then, apply pressure with a tight bandage for about fifteen hours, then remove it and take out the garlic. Leave the wound for two or three days and then dress it.
Place a cotton pad soaked in clarified butter over it until the area becomes suppurated. Then, treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. Or, if you wish, you can use some of the burning medicines I mentioned in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
And as for cauterizing it with iron, it is done in this way: Heat the cautery iron, which is illustrated as follows:
It is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head resembles a nail, with some grooves and a small protuberance in the middle.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you slowly rotate the iron, and the amount burned of the skin's thickness should be about half. Then lift your hand so you do not burn the artery underneath and cause bleeding, then soak a cotton pad in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days. Then wrap the cotton in oil, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, cauterize this vein with the pointed blade of the cautery, and thus safeguard against cutting the artery in this chronic vein, particularly.
Chapter Four.
Cauterizing the chronic vein.
If you have treated the vein with the aforementioned treatment and what we have described in the classifications of diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you see a cause that does not respond to the initial cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire, Then you should heat the pointed cautery until it whitens, after marking the site of the pain with a line about half a finger's width long, and once you hold it tight to cut the artery and reach towards the bone.
However, you must be careful not to touch the jaw that moves when chewing, lest you burn the muscle or nerve that moves it, causing spasm.
And be cautious and watchful of the bleeding from the artery that you have cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for one who does not know what to do and has not been practiced, abandoning the procedure is better.
The treatment of accidental bleeding from an artery will be discussed in its proper place in the book, God willing, if you see an ailment for which this cauterization is not suitable.
And if you see the patient's body able to bear it, cauterize a spot on the center of the head as described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, use the cauterization mentioned in the chapter on treating arterial wounds with the two-bladed cautery; it is a better and more effective cauterization than this one.
Chapter Five.
On cauterizing ear aches.
If pain in the ear occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other treatments we have mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not subside, heat the cautery called a 'point' that has this shape.
Then, after heating it, apply it around the entire ear, or around both ears if the pain is in both, in a circular motion. Move the cautery slightly from the base of the ear after marking the spot with ink.  The cautery should be about ten points in size for each ear, or thereabouts.  Then treat the areas until healing occurs, God willing.
Chapter Six.
In cauterizing the nerve.
The nerve that is treated by cauterization is of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
One should avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When treating this type of nerve affliction with poultices, massages, and gargles, if your treatment is unsuccessful, then the afflicted person should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization should be performed with a cautery in line with the upper part of the ear, slightly below the crown of the head, and another in the temple, with a length equal to the length of the thumb.
Apply the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery iron; it is a type of knife, similar to the one previously illustrated, but slightly gentler, as you see. The knife should have a slight excess of thickness, and then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On cauterization of chronic stroke.
If the stroke persists and treatment as described does not work, and if the patient does not have a fever, cauterize four times. A cauterization on each temple, a cauterization in the middle of the head as mentioned, and a cauterization at the back of the head, as previously described.
The cautery treatment, as previously mentioned.  A cauterization may also be applied to the mouth of the stomach, which may be more effective, and then treat as previously described.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for amnesia.
One suffering from phlegm-related amnesia should first be given large doses of emetics and purgatives to cleanse the brain.
Then his entire head should be shaved, and a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on dressings, should be applied to his back repeatedly; it is a form of cautery.
And do this in the same manner as I mentioned there. If he is cured by this, then do so. Otherwise, cauterize three times at the back of his head, aligned from the top of his head to the bottom of his neck.
Leave the thickness of a finger between each cauterization, and then treat the cauterization as previously described.  If you wish to increase the treatment and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you wish to increase the treatment, cauterize on the temples. Then treat until he is healed, and the cauterization should be olive-oil based, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterization for paralysis and general body relaxation.
First, cleanse the head with the previously mentioned methods. Then shave the patient's head and cauterize a spot in the middle of the head, and a spot on each temple, and a spot on the back of the head.
And three cauterizations on the cervical vertebrae. If the treatment for body relaxation requires more than that, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is strong and entrenched, cauterize four spots on the vertebrae of his back. Cauterize until most of the skin is burned, then lift your hand and treat him as previously described until he is healed, God willing.  The cauterizing tool should be made of olive wood.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterization for epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is due to phlegm should be cauterized.  First, one should cleanse his brain with large leeches, and with all the other treatment we have mentioned in the division, if the patient is large and able to take medications.
However, if he is a child who cannot tolerate medication, then use gargles and mouthwashes that cleanse the brain for many days beforehand, while also improving his diet.
Then shave his head, and cauterize with one cautery in the center of the head, as described previously, and another cautery in the back of the head. And on each temple of his head, a cautery. If the patient is strong and able to tolerate it, cauterize with the cauteries mentioned in the section on paralysis and relaxation of the body, on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.  Use an olive-shaped cautery, as described previously.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this way.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauteries we have mentioned in the section on paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess leaning towards black bile, and the patient's body is damp, evacuate what purifies the brain, as previously described in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of linen, like a circle, and place it in the middle of his head. The patient sits upright, holding it from every side. Then take one pound of old sheep's fat.
Then heat it over a moderate fire until a finger can tolerate it when inserted.  Then pour it into the circle on his head, and leave it until it cools.  Do this for the patient once a week with other good treatment, until he is healed, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, scattered cauteries, without holding the cautery in your hand, but rather using a gentle touch. This type of cautery will moisten the brain moderately.
Then apply a linen cloth soaked in clarified butter or chicken fat.
The twelfth chapter.
In the cauterization of water flowing from the eye.
If you observe water flowing from the eye, with the symptoms mentioned in the section, then immediately treat the patient.  Clean the head and protect it from all moisture, and sweat the patient in a bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize with a cautery in the middle of the head, and cauterize twice on the temples, if the water is flowing from both eyes, or from one side if only one eye is affected.
Then, with the cautery, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin.  Let the cauteries be long and wide along the temples, and be careful not to cause excessive bleeding.
If you see anything of it, cut it at the site using any method possible.  We will discuss the wisdom of dealing with arteries and cutting them, and how to prevent bleeding.
One may also cauterize twice, strongly, at the back of the head, beneath the bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and arise from veins and arteries on the surface of the head (external to the head), and you are certain that it is due to excess cold, thick, phlegmatic material, cauterize with the cauterization described at the beginning of the discussion of descending water. One cauterization in the center of the head, two on the temples, and two at the nape of the neck, beneath the bones.  If further cauterization is needed, cauterize on each side of the eye's corner, at the edge of the eyebrow, using a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing nasal foulness.
If treatment with what we have mentioned in the classification was unsuccessful, then proceed to bleed the patient from the temples three nights.  Then shave the head and cauterize the middle part using the olive oil cautery. Then cauterize with the nail cautery two points above the eyebrows, slightly beneath the hair.  Be mindful of the artery, do not cut it.  This is an image of the nail cautery.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to disease or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize above the eyebrows slightly, two points on each side, keeping them a distance from the temples and making the length of each cautery along the length of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the cauterization, but only to the extent that one-third of the skin is burned, and the shape of the cautery should be like this.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its eyelashes turn inward and injure the eye, cauterization is of two types. Either by fire or by a burning medicine.  As for cauterizing with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to let his eyelashes grow long and straight if he is one who plucks them.
If it has injured him while growing, bind his eyes with a bandage so they don't move until they grow long. Then, when they have grown long and straightened, place the patient's head on your lap and mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of a leaf of as.
Begin the marking near the eyelashes. Then place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or the saliva of a buzzard under the eyelid.  Then heat this iron, which is its image.
Then cauterize in the shape you marked, little by little, in many applications, until the surface of the skin, which is like the entire visible shape of an as leaf, is burned.  A sign of successful work is to see the eyelid wrinkled and the hair raised from the eye's flesh.
Then remove your hand. Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton pad with ghee until the scab comes off. Then treat with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair grows back later and the eyelid relaxes.
Then repeat the cauterization at that spot as you did at first. If the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not injure the eye.  As for cauterization with the burning medicine, tell the patient to leave the eyelashes to grow long and straighten.
Then make a shape of an as leaf from paper. Then take from the usual soap and quicklime, one dirham's weight or similar of each. Grind them thoroughly together, doing this quickly so they do not dry. Then spread some of this mixture onto the paper, shaped like the as leaf, and place it on the single or both eyelids. Place a cotton pad soaked in egg white under the eye and the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on top of the medicine and press it gently, moving it whenever the patient feels the burning of the medicine, because he will feel a burning like fire.  As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine, and move it with your finger. When the burning subsides, remove the medicine and rinse the eye with water.
And see, if you see the eyelid has risen as it rises when cauterized with fire or cut. Otherwise, apply more medicine to the area where the medicine has not taken effect and has not blackened until you complete your work and the eye is cauterized. Then apply cotton with oil until the burning subsides.
Then treat it with the palm ointment or another, until it heals.  You must be extremely careful during the procedure to ensure that no medicine falls into the eye.  If the eyelid relaxes after a few days and you are concerned about something in the eye, (something like hair perhaps) ...
Then reapply the medicine to the relaxed area of the eyelid, specifically as you did at first, and treat it until it heals. This is a picture of the as leaf.
Know that people's eyes vary in size and age.  Therefore, your cauterization should vary accordingly.  The correct procedure is not hidden from those who have experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
Cauterization of the polyp which appears in the eye's cul-de-sac.
If you treated the polyp using the methods described in the section on diseases, and your treatment was not successful, then it is necessary to cauterize it in this way.
Order the patient to place their head in your lap, and have a servant hold the head firmly in your hands, preventing any movement or jerking.
Then place a cotton swab moistened with egg white or the juice of the prickly pear on his eyes, then heat the cauterizing iron, which is depicted in this illustration.
It should be hollow, like a bird of prey's feather tube, on the cauterizing end, and if you wish, it can be pierced on the other end, or else solid like a rod; but this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the polyp if it is open, and remove the matter from it, and dry it. Or if it is not open, then open it and remove its pus.  Then apply the red-hot cautery to it and hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
Keep your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose when cauterizing, so that your hand doesn't miss or the patient doesn't get distressed, and the cautery doesn't fall onto the eyelid, damaging it. If it reaches the bone on the first cauterization, then good; otherwise, reheat the cautery a second time if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton swab with oil and treat it with the dried ointment until it heals.  If it takes forty days and it hasn't healed, then apply the strong corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed, and remove it as described in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing the polyp, mentioned by some earlier authors, involves reaching the polyp's location, slitting it, and placing a thin funnel into the slit—this is its form.
Pour in lead, melted to the weight of a dirham, into the funnel.  Hold the funnel firmly with your hand, and keep the patient completely still, so that the molten lead does not run into their eye.  You should place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
The lead will burn the polyp and heal it remarkably.  If the polyp heals with the cauterization and treatment mentioned, then well and good; otherwise, one must use a nasal incision and return the polyp to the nasal passage, as will be detailed in its dedicated section.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing cleft lip.
A cleft in the lip, called the hairlip, often occurs, especially in the lips of young boys.  If you have treated this cleft with the methods mentioned in the classification and the treatment was not successful, then heat a small, knife-like cautery iron in this manner...
Make its hollow as thin as a knife's blade, then apply it heated swiftly to the same cleft, until the cautery reaches the depth of the cleft; then treat it with a qiyarūtī (ointment/application) until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing a fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a tumor appears at the base of the gums, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, and then ulcerates and bursts, forming a fistula from the discharge of pus, and if treatment has failed, then a cautery should be heated to a size that fits within the fistula.
Then insert it, heated, into the fistula's opening, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depths and its end; do this once or twice, and then treat it afterward with the treatment we mentioned until it heals, God willing.
If the matter ceases and heals, otherwise, the site must be examined, and the corrupted bone must be removed, as will be described in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Relaxed teeth and gums.
If the gums are relaxed due to moisture, and the teeth have moved, and treatment with medications has been ineffective, then place the patient's head on your lap, and heat the cauterizing iron, whose image will come after this, then place the tube on the tooth.
Then quickly insert the hot cauterizing iron, hold your hand a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then remove your hand, then repeat the application of the cauterizing iron several times as desired, then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water.
He should hold it for an hour and then spit it out.  The loose tooth will become fixed, the relaxed gums will firm up, and the putrid moisture will dry.
Chapter Twenty-one.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is due to cold or contains worms, and treatment with medication does not work, cauterization can be applied in two ways: either with oil or with fire.
For cauterization with oil, take cow's ghee, heat it in an iron ladle or a shell, then take a cotton ball, wrap it around the end of a probe, dip it in the heated ghee, and place it quickly on the aching tooth, holding it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.  If you prefer, you may dip wool or cotton in cold ghee and place it on the aching tooth, then place the heated iron on top until the heat reaches the base of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, use a copper or iron tube, with some thickness in its body to prevent the fire's heat from reaching the patient's mouth.  Then, heat the cauterizing instrument (as depicted) and apply it to the same tooth, holding it until it cools. Repeat this several times.
The pain will subside either that day or the next.  Following the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good ghee and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  This is the form of the cautery instrument.
Cauterize with whichever end you prefer, and in a manner that is possible.  This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing swine.
If the swine are suffering from phlegm and cold moisture, and if they do not respond to ripening with medication and you desire rapid ripening, heat the hollow cautery, whose image, with two open ends, is this.
To allow the smoke to escape during cauterization from the opposite end, place it on the same tumor once, and again if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery the same size as the tumor.
Then leave it for three days, and apply a cotton swab dipped in clarified butter until the burnt area from the fire is gone. Then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
Chapter twenty-three.
In cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If phlegm predominates in the trachea, especially if it is accompanied by a cold temperament, the patient should first be purged with laxative medications, then cauterized with a cautery on the notch of the throat, at the base of the larynx, in the low-lying area.
Be careful not to reach the larynx with the cautery, and burn only half of the skin. Then cauterize again at the neck joint, at the end of the last bead of it, intensely.  The cautery should be a nail-shaped one, as previously described.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned previously until he is healed, God willing.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
On cauterizing lung disease and coughs.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture, and there is no fever or consumption in the patient, and the illness is chronic, cauterize twice above the collarbones in the soft, hollow, lower areas, and once more in the center of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be in the shape of nails, as previously described.  If you prefer, let your cauterization be by dripping with the cautery called "the point", as its form was previously described in the section on treating ear pain.  The points should be from thirty to approximately that number.
Then treat him with what was previously mentioned until he is cured. You may also use a cautery with three branches in this form.  Cauterization with this is hastened, since you cauterize three areas in one instance. This is a representation of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery moisture, or if it is not fixed when it is put back into place so that it becomes a habit for it to dislocate, and then dislocates at the slightest movement, as we have observed, then the condyle must be repositioned first. Then the patient lies on his back or on his right side, and the skin inside the armpit is lifted upwards with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inward.
Then the double-pronged cautery, whose image is this, is heated.
Then, with it, the skin is cauterized until it penetrates to the other side.  The shape of the cauterization is four cauterizations.  It may be cauterized with a three-pronged cautery, in which case the shape of the cauterization will be six cauterizations, and the prongs will be on the thinness of the wound.
And this is the image of the three-pronged cautery.
And one more may be added to this number, making eight cauterizations.  Then, on the cauterization, the pounded balls with salt are placed.  The patient must then keep the limb still and not move it for a time until it is strengthened, if the dislocation is upward, and this is rare.
Cauterize above the shoulder blade with one good, nail-like cautery, or many small, dotted cauterizations.  The joint will strengthen, the moisture will leave, and the patient will be cured.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If the stomach has contracted cold and excessive moisture, causing its temperament to be disrupted, and frequent ailments to occur, and various treatments have been ineffective, then the patient should lie on their back, with legs and arms extended, and be cauterized three times. Cauterize below the breastbone, a space the size of a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery iron, and two more below and to the sides of the first cautery so that the cauteries form a triangle.  Keep them spaced apart so that they do not coalesce upon suppuration. The depth of the cauteries should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.  Their shape should be [as described].
In this manner, and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cautery in the center of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery iron used for this single cauterization should be circular in shape, in this manner.
The stomach may also be cauterized with dots, for those who are averse to this cauterization.  Mark the stomach with dots as desired using ink, then cauterize them with a pointed cautery iron, and then treat with the previously mentioned remedy until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If a cold and moist or a hot, windy ailment afflicts the liver, causing a severe deviation from its natural temperament, and if the treatment previously mentioned in the classification is ineffective. The patient should lie on their back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink, exactly this shape and size, on the liver, beneath the collarbones, at the point where the human elbow ends.
After each cauterization, the cauterization should be the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization should be straight along the body. Do not press the cautery iron tightly.
The cauterization should burn through only half the thickness of the skin, no more.  The patient should stand on their feet, or if unable, lie down with legs extended and arms raised.  This is the shape of the cautery iron.
You may use a knife-like cautery iron for these cauterizations if you possess skill and care in the craft, taking care not to overdo the cauterization, so as not to burn the entire skin, burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines. The skin there is thin, so be aware of that.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
Cauterization of a liver tumor.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know if the swelling is in the liver's flesh or its membrane, if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient experiences a heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the liver's membrane, there is severe pain and sharpness with the pain. If the physicians have been unable to cure it, the patient should lie on their back, and then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire, it is a cautery that resembles a spear, and this is its image. Cauterize with a single cauterization until all the skin is burned and the cauterization reaches the membrane, so that all the matter comes out, then treat it with the treatment for abscesses until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be performed by those whose medical experience is extensive, and who have treated these diseases repeatedly.  Only then should they attempt such a procedure.  To leave it to me is better.
Chapter Twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients described cauterizing cold fistulas with the roots of the zarawand plant in the following way: take a single, longest, dry, zarawand root, as thick as a finger.  Then, dip it in oil and hold it in the fire. Then cauterize once between the collarbone and neck, and two small cauterizations slightly angled toward the area under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly angled backward, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest, another above the stomach, and three more from behind; one between the shoulders, and two beside the lumbar region, below the cauterization which is between the collarbones.
One should not insert the cauterizing instrument deeply, but only superficially on the skin, as a cauterization. Some of the ancients reported that some people used a heated iron implement, similar to a spatula, and used it to cauterize between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
The pus will drain as mentioned for liver tumors, but in this case, cauterization of these sores carries risks.  Either the patient will die immediately, or a non-healing ulcer will form at the site.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If the treatment of the spleen, as described in the previous section, proves ineffective, cauterization can be applied in three ways, all of which are correct: one way is to cauterize it three or four times, arranged lengthwise along the spleen.
In the same manner as the liver cauterizations previously described, with the distance between each cauterization being the thickness of a finger or slightly more.  Use the same cautery as described for the liver cauterization.  Do not probe deeply with the cautery, and the patient should be lying on their back.
The second method is at the elbow.  Lift the skin opposite the spleen, where the patient's left elbow ends.  Lift the skin the width of the body, so the cauterizations are lengthwise along the body.
Then, very carefully insert the cautery irons so that they pierce the skin on the other side.  Then withdraw the cautery, resulting in four cauterizations.  If desired, use the three-pronged cautery instead.
Then treat the cauterized area after allowing it to discharge pus for many days. This is more effective than any other treatment mentioned before.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On cauterization for dropsy.
Cauterization is only helpful in ascites, specifically. If, having treated the dropsy patient with the various therapies we have described in the classification, your treatment proves ineffective, then you should cauterize four times around the navel and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen, and two behind the back, one opposite his chest and the other opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin.  Then leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
Do not discontinue treatment after the cauterization, but provide the necessary care so that the afflicted person receives the requisite attention, thus expediting healing. The form of cautery used for the back is pointed, as previously described, and that used for the chest is olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If the feet swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the back of the foot at the point between the little finger and ring finger.
Hold your hand with the cautery, without bending it, and then lift it, never returning it.  Yellow water will drain, and the cautery should be of this form.
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg. The cauterization should be with the sharp tip of the cautery.  Make one cauterization down the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below that towards the middle of the leg.  And cauterize each thigh, two cauterizations on each.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, allowing the water to drain. Then treat it with the rest of the methods we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and dampness, weakening the digestive and binding forces in the stomach and intestines, and if various treatments have failed to cure it, and you see the patient able to tolerate a cauterization and possessing sufficient strength, then cauterize a large area on their stomach. As previously mentioned, cauterize the stomach with a circular cautery iron, and perform four cauterizations around the navel with a fine pointed cautery iron.  Apply one or two large cauterizations on the lumbar region above the coccyx.
If you perceive abundant moisture and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize a spot on the pubic area, a spot on each flank, and possibly two small cauterizations near the larger one on the stomach.  This is a successful and unfailing treatment, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are many chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, or a single one, composed of thick cold humors or putrid moisture, and the treatment mentioned in the section did not work, cauterize the patient three times on the lower part of the spine, slightly beneath the table, in a triangular pattern.
And cauterize beneath the navel by the length of two fingers.  If you estimate that the patient's stomach has become cold, and their food does not digest, and you see their face swollen, cauterize a large spot on the stomach as described previously, and cauterize their liver. And another on their spleen with a nail-shaped cautery. Leave the cauterization open for a time, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery, which resembles a needle, then insert it, heated, into the same cut wart, and push with your hand until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood is flowing. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they are healed. If you cauterize a large one on the cotton, it would be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On cauterizing the fistula in the buttocks and surrounding areas.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure we described in its location, and avoids it, cauterization may perhaps heal it. If a fistula occurs on someone and it has persisted, discharging pus and corrupt humors, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then, ascertain the depth of its penetration with the probe.  Then heat the cautery iron, resembling a stylus, and insert it hot into the same fistula along the path of the fistula's depth and the extent to which the probe entered. Apply the cautery to it repeatedly, one or two or three times, as needed, until all the corrupt bodies are burned.
And be cautious of burning a nerve, if one exists, or a large vein, if the fistula opens into the bladder or into the intestine.
And be wary of all these locations.  You should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you assess that it is not penetrating. Then treat the area until it heals.  If the area seals up, the materials cease, and it remains like this for a period, know that it has healed completely.
If the materials do not cease, know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupt bone in its depth, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its proper place.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On Cauterizing the Kidney.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's sexual function is thus diminished, it is appropriate to cauterize them on the loins, one cauterization on each kidney, using the nail-shaped cautery mentioned previously.  It may be cauterized three times in the same spot, producing three aligned cauterizations, which is more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On Cauterizing the Bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot control urination, cauterize the bladder with one cauterization below the navel, where the pubic hair begins, and another to the right and one more to the left of the navel.
After each cauterization, make it the size of a thumb's width. Cauterize the lower back with one or two cauterizations, if necessary.  The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If the uterus contains matter from cold and dampness, preventing conception, corrupting the menstrual flow, or causing pain during menstruation, then three cauterizations should be made around the navel, as described in cauterizing the bladder. One or two cauterizations should be made on the lower back, on the lumbar region.  The cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Erroneous humidity may accumulate in the hip joint, causing it to dislocate.  A sign of this is that one leg will be longer than the other when compared, and a space will be found at the site of the dislocation.  The affected area at the hip joint itself should be cauterized with a roughly circular cautery.
After applying the marking around the joint, so that the joint itself lies in the center of the circle, use the cautery depicted in the stomach cauterization section.  If that cautery is unavailable, perform three cauterizations with the large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cautery as deep as the thickness of the entire skin, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-one.
In cauterizing the sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and moisture, and treatment according to the classifications mentioned earlier is ineffective and prolonged, the patient should be relieved from thick humors through the use of rotten seeds, or the seeds of aloe, and similar substances.
Then cauterize, and the method of cauterization has two types: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.  Cauterization with fire has many methods, one of them being to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
This produces a beneficial depth, and the interval between each cauterization should be the thickness of a finger. The cautery should be olive-colored.  A cauterization can also be made in the center on the head of the hip itself, creating four cauterizations.  Or, if you prefer, cauterize with the circular method previously mentioned for hip dislocation – one cauterization.
To make a circle encompassing the entire hip, burning all the thickness of the skin; this is the method of cauterization in sciatica, if the pain is confined to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize twice on the thigh, at the location the patient indicates the pain, and once above the heel by four fingers, slightly toward the outer side. The cautery should be scalpel-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should only be the thickness of the skin.
If the patient indicates the pain extends to the toes, cauterize at the indicated spot with the pinpoint cautery three or four times, or more, if necessary. If the pain is indicated below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with one scalpel-shaped cauterization.
Be careful in all your cauterizations to avoid burning a major nerve or artery, as this would cause a serious or lasting injury to the patient.
I have seen cases where someone cauterized above the heel and overdid the cauterization, resulting in gangrene of the leg, extending to the foot and its complete perforation, and the ruin of the entire limb.  Subsequently, diarrhea and death ensued. If the pain is in both areas, cauterize them in the same manner.
Some knowledgeable scholars have described a hip cauterization using a cautery instrument fashioned like a cup, made of iron.  The diameter of this cup is half a span, and its rim is the thickness of a date pit, or slightly less. Within this cup is another cup, and within that, a third.
The distance between each cup is the width of a thumb. The cups are open on both sides and their height is approximately one or two thumbs.  A handle of iron, firmly attached to the cups, is fitted. This is its description.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and sparks, and is then placed on the affected hip.  The patient is lying on their healthy side.  Three circular cauterizations are made at once.  Then, the patient is left for three days, the wound dressed with clarified butter.  The wound is left open for several days.
Many more treatments follow, then it is treated with ointment until healed. The author of this book says that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its ugliness and frightening appearance, and because few can tolerate it. However, it is a good cauterization for those who can endure it and have the affliction in that area.
As for cauterization with burning medications, one makes two cups, similar to the throats used for pouring wine, made of copper or iron.
Their height is about two thumbs' breadth, and the distance between them is the thickness of a finger.  The bottom and top are open, and they are connected in this way.
Then, one places them on the affected hip, the patient lying on their healthy side.  Hold the cups firmly, and then pour a little of hot, sharp water between the circles.  Hold them for about a sandglass' worth of time. The patient will endure the burning, experiencing a burning sensation like fire.
Until the burning subsides, then remove the instrument and wash the entire hip with fresh water. Leave it for three days and apply fat to it until the blackness of the burn disappears.  Leave it for several days allowing the pus to drain; this is more beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until healed.  If the pain spreads to the thigh or leg, make a mold to hold water, similar to what was done with the hip. This is a description of the sharp water, and its efficacy is proven in the treatise on the preparation of remedies.
Take one part of potash and one part of quicklime.  Grind them and place them in a new pot, pierced with a single small hole at the bottom, just large enough for a rod to enter.  Place another glazed pot beneath the base of the first pot.
Pour fresh water over the potash and lime, enough to cover them by a finger's breadth, after firmly pressing them with your hand. Let the pot stand until the sharp water drains into the lower glazed pot. Collect all of this water, and then pour it over fresh lime and potash.
It will then be extremely potent, effective in many medical treatments, and for cauterizing other body parts, for it acts like fire itself.  There are also remedies that cauterize the hip, such as thafsīya, balaḍhr honey, and lime mixed with soap, ground into a paste.
Galen, recounting an ancient physician's treatment for hip pain and sciatica, greatly praised it.  He claimed it required no other treatment and cured the ailment in a single instance.
Indeed, he might even have been carried into the bath and emerged cured.  To do this, take fresh green shiṭraj (if no green is available, use fresh dried). Grind it with a little fat and apply it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg or thigh.
Hold it in place for three hours, or until the patient feels the burning subside.  Then, take him to the bath.  If his body sweats, put him in a basin.  The pain will vanish, and he will be cured, God willing.  If not cured, repeat the application ten days later.
He will be cured, God willing.  Be aware that no one should use these cauterizing remedies until the body is emptied.  Dioscorides mentioned that goat's dung, when used for cauterizing sciatica, can be beneficial.
The cauterization should be done this way: soak wool in old oil, and place it on the deep area between the thumb and the elbow, closer to the elbow. Then take dry goat's dung.
Heat it in the fire until it becomes ember, then place it on the wool and let it cool. Repeat this until the sensation extends from the middle of the upper arm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing.  This type of cauterization is called the cauterization with dung.
Chapter Forty-two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Pain in the back may arise from various causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It may be due to the effusion of cold, moist matter.  Cauterization is effective only in this type of case.
After the patient has vomited, using rotten herbs, and similar remedies, the affected area on his back should be cauterized in three rows, across the width of the table itself.  After marking the area with ink, make five cauterizations, or more, in each row, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength.
Use a point cautery iron, or if desired, use a medium-sized nail cautery iron to make three or four cauterizations in this manner.
The forty-third chapter.
In cauterizing the initial swelling.
This ailment often affects young children.  A sign of its initial stages in a child is shortness of breath when standing or moving, and a prominent bead-like protrusion will be found at the end of the vertebrae in the back.
If you see this and wish to halt its progress, cauterize it with a circular cautery iron, like this. Apply the cauterization evenly to each side of the vertebra.  If desired, cauterize around the vertebra with a pinpoint cautery iron, in two or three rows, keeping the points close together. Then treat the area until it heals as described.
Avoid using cautery on a swelling caused by nerve spasm.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are due to cold dampness affecting any part of the body, and if the pain occurs in the legs, physicians typically call it gout, especially.
If the cold gout, its cause, is treated with the methods we mentioned in the classification, and the pains do not subside, then cauterization will remove them.  This is done by applying numerous cauterizations around the joint of the legs after emesis. The cautery iron should be olive-oil medium-sized, in this manner.
And if it is necessary to cauterize on the leg itself, use a pointed cautery iron.  If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, which often occurs, cauterize three or four times on each side of each knee with this same olive-oil cautery iron.
If more cauterization is needed, cauterize, but do not make the cauterization deep, only to the thickness of the skin.  If the pain ascends to the hips or back, use the cauterization described in its corresponding section.
If the pain is only in the hands, cauterize around the wrists in a circular fashion, like two rows.  If the pain remains in the fingers, cauterize a single point on each joint and on the palm of the hand. If after days the pain ascends to the elbows or shoulders,
Cauterize them (the elbows or shoulders) on each side.  The patient should not neglect good treatment and the taking of medications.  If he improves his diet and expels phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter forty-five.
On cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some of the intestines and bowels have descended into the testicle, and this is a recent onset, the patient should be instructed to abstain from food for the day and to use laxatives to evacuate his bowels.
Then, have the patient lie on their back before you, and instruct them to hold still until the bowel or intestine protrudes.  Then, push it back with your finger.  Then, mark with ink beneath the hernia on the pubic bone a sign resembling a semicircle, its edges extending upwards towards the body.
Then, heat a cautery iron, of this shape.
Until it becomes white, emitting sparks.  Then, return the bowel or intestine to its place. Then, a servant should place his hand on the area, so the bowel does not protrude again.  The patient's legs should be separated, and a cushion placed underneath. Another servant should hold the patient's legs together.
Another servant should hold the patient's arms. Then the cautery iron should be placed on the same mark.  Your hand on the cautery iron should be straight, holding it until it reaches the bone, or repeat the procedure if it did not reach the bone the first time.
Strive to prevent the bowel from protruding while cauterizing, so that you do not burn it, which could cause either death or a great affliction for the patient.  Know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed.  The cautery iron should be appropriate for children and adults according to their respective needs.
Then, treat the cauterized area with oil after three days to alleviate the harshness of the burn.  Then treat it with other ointments until it heals.  The patient should remain lying on their back for forty days until the wound closes.
His diet during treatment should be such as to soften his bowels, to prevent the intestines from protruding when he defecates.  After forty days, if he wishes to stand, use a firm bandage and keep it on for another forty days. Reduce his fatigue, and his intake of food, drink, and loud noises.
If he follows this treatment, he will be completely healed, God willing. I will discuss the treatment of hernias by incision in its own section, God willing.  As for a hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is just beginning, if you want it to not grow, cauterize the hernia with a circular cautery the size of the hernia. Let the amount of skin burned be approximately one-third of the hernia. Then treat it as described. It will not grow, God willing. Some earlier practitioners mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery, in this manner.
After drawing the lines for the hernia, the line horizontally across the top of the hernia and the other line below, placing your hand in the center, cauterize with one single, nail-like cautery. The first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If, in any organ, a fall or blow causes pain that persists for a long time and is not relieved by medication, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pinpoint cautery. The cauterization of each organ should be in accordance with its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And the pain and fistula will be relieved. If he is cured from the first cauterization, otherwise, you repeat the cauterization, because it is usual for these pains to spread from the organ to what is close to it; therefore, one must pursue the cauterization until the patient is cured.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for those with leprosy, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize him, observe. If the leprosy is in its early stages and you have treated it as described in the section on classification, and it has not deteriorated or stopped, and you fear that the corruption may affect all the humors of the patient, cauterize the head five times. One in the usual middle of the head, the second below that, towards the forehead, near the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one behind at the nape of the neck.  Apply the cauterization a little intensely, so that it affects the bone slightly.
And scales will peel off, making it easier for thick vapors to escape.  Cauterize also the spleen, as previously mentioned.  But if the leprosy has persisted and become evident in the patient, then you should cauterize the head with the described cauterizations. One cauterization on the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the thoracic vertebrae, one large one on the coccyx, near the base of the tail, another one above it on the same area, and two on each thigh, one on each hip. Two on each knee, one on each knee, two on each shoulder, two on each elbow, two on the ribs of the chest, and cauterize each joint of his fingers and toes, and each heel of his feet and the wrist of his hands.
And be careful not to burn the nerve behind the heels, you might also cauterize the pubic bone, the stomach opening, and the liver.  Know that the more cauterizations you make, the more beneficial and effective they are.
Know that the patient does not experience pain from the cauterization as a healthy person would, because their body is numb.  The cauteries should be of varying sizes, large and small, appropriate to the organs and joints, according to the characteristics of the cauterizing irons described previously.
Then treat the cauterization with fine crushed cumin seeds mixed with honey, and other treatments until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Forty-eight.
Concerning cauterization of numbness: If a part of the body becomes numb and is treated with medicines, ointments, and dressings, but does not heal, then cauterize that same numb part with cauterizations according to the size of the affected body part, whether large or small.  Let your cauterizations be slightly deeper in the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  Sometimes cauterization is used for numbness that affects the hand and foot in the spine, at the exit point of the nerve that moves that limb, to relieve the numbness.
Only those who are knowledgeable about the anatomy of organs and the pathways of the nerves that move the body should undertake this.
Chapter Forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of leprosy.
If leprosy persists and no medical treatment proves effective, cauterize it with a moderate depth, proportionate to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil,  horsetail leaves, and dove's blood or the blood of the hookbills, each ingredient in equal parts. Mix them all, apply to a cloth, and bandage the affected area until healed.
Chapter Fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it rotates. Some physicians have suggested a severe cauterization in the center, but I do not recommend this, as I anticipate ulceration, having witnessed it several times.
So the correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with many small cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-one.
Concerning the cauterization of the fistula.
If a fistula occurs and is slow to mature, either because of the agent causing it, or the patient's age (if the patient is elderly and anemic), or because of time, and you wish to hasten the fistula's maturation, cauterize around it with many small, scattered cauterizations.
Then leave it, for this will hasten maturation.  If you wish to cauterize it further, heat the cautery iron which has this shape.
Place it in the center of the fistula until it penetrates the skin.  Let the cauterization be positioned somewhat lower, so that the discharge of pus is facilitated.  Then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
The Fifty-second Chapter.
On cauterizing ulcers.
Ulcers are a corruption that consumes the tissue, just as fire consumes dry wood.  If you see an ulcer in a place suitable for cauterization with fire, heat a cautery iron with numerous small and large nails, according to what is appropriate for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from all sides until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains. Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas, so that all the scabs and all the corruption are removed.
Then treat it with healing ointments. If after three days you see that the flesh grows soundly without any corruption, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on any remaining corrupted areas.  Ulcers can also be treated with strong medicine.
For it is quicker and more effective than cauterization with fire.  I have previously described its treatment with strong medicine in the categorization, so take it from there when needed.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This affliction, a rough, painful condition, frequently occurs on the soles of the feet.  Cauterization in these cases can be done in two ways: either with fire or with strong caustic water.
As for cauterization with fire, heat a hollowed-out cautery, resembling an eagle's beak, made of iron, sized to completely surround the nail.  Its edges should be thin. Then, place the hot cautery on the nail, and rotate your hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail.
Leave it for three days, allowing pus to form, then bandage it with crushed wild barley mixed with salt, leaving the bandage on for a night.  This will remove the nail from its roots.  Then treat the wound with a healing ointment until healed. This applies if the nails are not inverted.
It often occurs on the surface of the body, particularly on the hands and feet.  Therefore, take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's beak and place it on the nail or wart.  Then, pour a small amount of caustic water into the tube.
Hold the tube with your hand, gently rotating it, so that the edges of the tube affect the root of the nail, allowing the caustic water to penetrate to the nail's root. The patient should endure the stinging sensation of the caustic water for a short while.
Then leave it.  The nail will be removed from its roots.  Do this to each one, until all of them on the body have been treated.  Then treat the affected areas afterwards with ointments that promote healing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On cauterization.
If someone suffers from a cold in the nerve, or from a fever, or anything else, then four or five cauterizations should be applied on the back, one cauterization between each bead, and one on the chest. And apply a cauterization to his stomach with the olive-oil cautery, for the affliction will subside and the cold illness will quickly mature.
Chapter Fifty-five.
On cauterizing a wound that has occurred on the body.
Ugly boils may arise on the body due to thick, corrupt cold materials.  When they first appear, a gentle cauterization should be applied to the head of each boil with a stick whose end has been ignited with fire, or with the long root of the zeraound, or with a lens cautery.
Boils may be cauterized in this manner at their initial outbreak, and the causative factor will diminish and the afflicted person will recover, but the patient should have been bled beforehand.
Chapter Fifty-six.
On cauterizing bleeding from a severed artery.
Bleeding frequently occurs from a severed artery in a wound from the outside, or when incising a tumor, or cauterizing a part of the body, and similar cases, making it difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger over the mouth of the artery, pressing gently to contain the blood beneath your finger and prevent any leakage. Then, take several small and large olive-oil cauteries and heat them in the fire until they are very hot.
Then, take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery has ruptured, and apply the cautery to the same vein after quickly removing your finger. Hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If the blood spurts out when you remove your finger from the artery's opening and the cautery cools down, quickly take another cautery from the heated ones and continue doing so one after the other until the bleeding stops.
Be cautious not to burn a nerve, lest you cause further harm to the patient.  Know that if an artery is bleeding, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is large, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by amputation if it has not already been severed. If it is severed, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop, or it can be tightly ligated with thread, or medications that stop bleeding and firm compresses can be applied.
However, attempting to stop the bleeding by tying, compressing with cloth, or applying burning objects, and the like, will not succeed, except rarely. If someone in such a situation is not attended to by a physician or does not have a remedy, he should immediately place the index finger over the opening of the wound itself, as we have described.
He should press firmly until the blood is contained and flows from above the wound and over the artery and the finger.  The finger should not be removed until the blood has clotted and thickened, and the bleeding has stopped.  During this time, assess what cauterization or medications are needed.
Chapter Two.
On incisions, punctures, phlebotomy, and wounds, and the like.
Khalaf said: We have mentioned in the previous chapter all diseases suitable for cauterization with fire and caustic medicines, their causes and reasons, and the tools and types of cauterization, arranging this into chapters from beginning to end.
And I will follow the same path in this chapter, so that the student may easily achieve what they seek.
Before I begin, you children should know that this chapter contains greater risks than the previous chapter on cauterization.
For this reason, caution must be even stronger, because in this chapter, the work often involves expelling the blood, on which life depends, when opening a vein or cutting a tumor, puncturing an abscess, treating a wound, removing an arrow, cutting a stone, and similar procedures.  All these carry risks and fear, and death often results.
I advise you to avoid any uncertain procedure.  In this craft, you may encounter people suffering from various illnesses; some may be weary of their disease and disdain death.
Due to the severity of their illness and the prolonged suffering, some show clear signs of approaching death; others offer you their wealth, hoping to gain health, yet their illness is fatal.  You should not assist those who exhibit this character at all.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness. Do not undertake anything without certain knowledge of a favorable outcome. In all your treatments of patients, prioritize knowledge and warn them of the possible consequences for their well-being.
For this will aid you in earning praise, glory, remembrance, and thanks. May God grant you wisdom, my children, and remove error and misfortune from your path.  For it is in His power, and there is no god but Him.
This chapter is arranged in sections, as was done in the chapter on cauterization, from the head to the feet, so that you will find what you need more easily, God willing.
The First Chapter.
On treating the water that collects in the heads of young children.
This affliction often appears in young children at birth if the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness.  It may also arise from a hidden cause unknown.
I have seen this affliction only in children, and all whom I have seen have died quickly from it. Therefore, I have avoided treating it. I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger each day. Until the child could not sit upright due to the enormity of his head, and the moisture increased until he perished.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone, or under the bone upon the peritoneum. If the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, one should make a single transverse incision in the middle of the head, about two spans long, so that the moisture drains away. This is the image of the scalpel.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling larger, make two intersecting incisions in this manner.
If the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and the water sinks when you press it with your hand inwards—this should not be hidden from you—then one should make three incisions in the middle of the head, like this.
After the incision, all the moisture will emerge. Then, the incisions are bound with strips and bandages.  Then, it is applied from above with poultices and oil until the fifth day.  Then, the bandages are removed and the wound is treated with compresses and ointments.  Do not allow the head to be bound too tightly.  Feed the patient with all dry foods with little moisture.
Until the limb strengthens and heals.  Another method of incision is to observe where the bone of the swelling and the gathering of water are visible, because it may be more prominent in the back of the head, or the front, or to the right or left.
Therefore, you should make the incision where the swelling and water accumulation are apparent.  Make the incision to the extent you can, being careful not to cut an artery and cause bleeding, for from such bleeding the patient may die.  Together with the expulsion of moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears, known as the *hassisins*.
When someone suffers a severe affliction of the eyes or chest, and the medicinal treatment proves ineffective, the appropriate treatment is to cut these two arteries.
If you wish to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to expose the artery.  Then, you should pull the patient's neck tight using their clothing.  Then, look where the vein pulsates and the two lower locations behind the ears; these are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then, mark them with ink, and then cut them with a lancet, severing them to the bone. This should be done at the width of the head.  If you wish, you insert the lancet under the artery and cut it upwards. The length of the cut should be about two clenched fingers.
If the artery is cut, the blood will flow in a pulsating manner, spurting forward in a continuous stream. If the artery is not visible, one should estimate the location, approximately three fingers behind the ear, and then mark it with ink and cut through to the bone.  The necessary...
Approximately six ounces of blood will be released immediately on average, though it may be more or less depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries. Then, examine the wound. If any part of the peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it.
So that a hot swelling does not appear.  Then, bind the wound with a linen thread, and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
The arteries of the temples.
If a person experiences chronic headaches or acute attacks from sharp dampness and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headaches, and similar conditions, and treatment by various medical methods proves ineffective, then we have tried in these illnesses cauterizing or cutting the arteries of the temples, as we have described.
The procedure for cauterizing them is to shave the patient's hair on the temples, and locate the visible artery in the temple, as its pulse will be apparent; it is rare that it will be hidden, except perhaps in some individuals.
Or, if it is hidden due to severe cold, have the patient tighten his neck with his clothing; then you should rub the area with a cloth, or apply warm water until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the lancet that has this image. Then, gently dissect the skin with the lancet until you reach the artery.  Then, insert a hook into it, pulling it upward until you have drawn it out of the skin and freed it from the membranes beneath it on all sides.  If the artery is thin, twist it with the end of the hook. Then, cut off a portion of it, to the extent that its ends separate and contract, without causing bleeding.  If it is not severed and cut, the blood will not recede at all.  Then drain the blood from six to three ounces.
If the artery is large, it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread.  The thread should be either silk or bowstring so that the wound does not fester before healing and bleeding does not recur.
Then cut the excess between the ligatures; do this at that moment or at another time.  If you wish, cauterize it to the bone with a sharp cautery iron until its ends are severed.  This will accomplish the same effect, or even better, as we have stated.
However, if the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, cauterization helps to consume moisture, making it more beneficial.  After dissecting the arteries, the area should be packed with old cotton and firm compresses applied. After the dressing, it should be treated with dry medicines that promote flesh regeneration and bandages, until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding occurs during your procedure from the artery, immediately cut it, either by cauterization or by filling the area with a styptic and pressing firmly until the bleeding stops. If none of these is available, use your finger to stop the blood.
Apply very cold water to the area until the inflammation subsides and it is properly constricted.  A less invasive and easier method than dissecting the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery iron, after having marked the areas with ink.
Apply it very hot until it reaches the bone, severing the vein in two places to create distance between the ends.  This cautery will not cause the parts to fuse.  This is a picture of the cautery iron.
The cautery iron has two sharp blades, similar to small knives, but much less sharp than a knife. If they were as sharp as a knife, the heat would dissipate quickly and the tissue would not be severed rapidly.  If they had some thickness, the heat of the fire would be retained.
This quickly severs the flesh.  This method is superior, less invasive, and easier than all others.  The space between the blades should be the thickness of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
For the treatment of persistent, hot watering of the eyes.
If the watering of the eyes is constant, originating from the veins on the skull's exterior, and no medicinal treatment is effective, and you see the patient's face has become red. And if he feels a crawling sensation in his forehead like ants, and his eyes are sunken and wet, their edges worn away, and their eyelids glued together by the intensity of the tears, the earlier practitioners of medicine were compelled to resort to this method in treating it, which they called "treatment with the sword." It involves instructing the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made in the forehead, lengthwise along the forehead. Each incision is about two fingers in length, parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second one slightly offset from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third one on the other side.
And be cautious of cutting the arteries on the sides, keeping your hand away from the contact of the jaws.  After each incision, there should be a space of three fingers clenched together.  Have with you prepared sponge pieces, or numerous dry cloths to absorb the blood.
Then, insert the sharp, two-pronged scalpel, which is depicted in this image. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, using it, remove all the skin between the incisions along with the periosteum on the bone. Then, do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, and then remove this scalpel. And insert into the first incision another instrument, called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth and blunt on the other.  This is its image:.
Place the sharp side of the scalpel towards the flesh attached to the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut all the vessels descending from the head to the eyes, without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do the same from the middle incision to the other incision.  After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, compress the areas of solidified blood clots. Then, place a cotton wick in each incision, and apply a bandage soaked in a mixture of syrup and oil, or vinegar and oil.
So that a hot swelling does not occur. On the third day, dissolve the ligaments and apply copious warm water compresses. Then treat it with basil ointment, rose oil, and other remedies used for wounds, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On treating tears and discharge from the eyes from within the head.
When someone has persistent, severe, frequent discharge, and their eyes appear gaunt and small, their vision weakened, and their eyelids ulcerated with eyelashes falling out. And there will be a sharp, painful ache deep within the head, and repeated sneezing.  Know from these symptoms that these substances and discharges come from numerous deep veins. The best treatment is to instruct the patient to shave their forehead, then make one incision in the center of the forehead.
And there will be a sharp, painful ache deep within the head, and repeated sneezing.  Know from these symptoms that these substances and discharges come from numerous deep veins. The best treatment is to instruct the patient to shave their forehead, then make one incision in the center of the forehead. or slightly raise it transversely, beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and the incision should be into the bone. Keep your hand away from the mobile temporal muscles used for chewing until, once the bone is exposed and all the blood is absorbed with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or flax thread, then apply splints over it and soak the splints with medicine and oil, to prevent a hot swelling.  Once you have resolved it and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a desiccated remedy that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of saffron, and preparing a salve from them. This is used to stimulate flesh growth in wounds of this type.
Chapter Six.
On treating what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or a semi-metallic stone, such as iron or glass; or a plant seed, such as chickpeas, nuts, and the like; or a liquid substance, such as water or vinegar, and the like.
If an animal or stone or a type of stone, that does not multiply inside the ear, has fallen in, then direct the sun toward the ear. If you see the stone, place a bit of violet or ceruce oil on it and then attempt to remove it by moving the head or by inducing sneezing with a cupping instrument. Close the nostrils when sneezing occurs after placing a bandage of cloth or wool around the ear and extending the ear upwards.  This treatment often removes the object. If it does not, then attempt to remove it with a gentle forceps, of which this is a picture.
If it is not removed with the forceps, then attempt to remove it with a gentle, slightly bent, blunt-ended hook. If that fails, make a tube of brass and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal.
Seal the area around the tube with softened pitch mixed with oil to prevent the wind from escaping other than through the tube, then pull it out forcefully with your breath. This often removes the object. If it is not removed by these methods, take a small amount of gum or a bird-catching gum and place it on the end of a spoon.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, then gently insert it into the ear canal after the ear has dried from moisture. If the object is not removed by all the methods described, then proceed to incision before inflammation or spasm occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient from the temples, according to their strength. Then, the patient sits before you, and you turn their ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near the fat in the lower part.
Make the incision crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can. Then immediately suture the incision and treat it until healed.
If the object that has fallen into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, try to remove it with the methods mentioned. If it does not come out, then take a thin, gentle lancet, shaped like this.
Try to cut that kind of fallen grain in the ear with it, but only do this if you are sure that the grain has become moistened with ear moisture so that it becomes many small pieces. Then remove it with a blind probe, or a soft piece of cloth, or by suction.
As we have mentioned, it is easier to remove it.  Regarding water entering the ear, the patient should first use a snuff with a handkerchief.  Having first filled their ear with some worn cotton, while lying on the ear with the water, if it comes out.
Otherwise, take many small, smooth stones, heat them slightly by fire, and have the patient insert one into the ear hole.  Then he should hop on one foot on that side, and strike another stone against the stone in the ear.
He continues doing this with stone after stone until all the water is removed.  Water may also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or feather, inserting one end into the ear, and burning the other end until most of it is charred, and then replacing the feather with another.
Do this repeatedly until all the water is expelled, or draw it out with a tube, as previously described for the stone.  As for removing an animal inside the ear, if it is small like a flea or the like, treat it as described in the classification.  And...
If its body is large enough to be felt, try to remove it with absorbent cotton and tweezers.  This is easier than all other things that can happen in the ear.  As for removing worms that have developed in the ear, if you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification in the article on tumors, and your treatment has not worked.
Therefore, you should look into the ear in the sun. If you see anything of the worm, remove it with absorbent cotton or delicate tweezers.  If nothing is visible, take a tube; this is its shape.
It is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. Insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate, then suck vigorously.  Do this repeatedly until all the worm is expelled.  If it does not come out, seal around the tube with wax, as I mentioned to you in the case of the stone.
If it does not come out with what we have described, use the cauterization tools that I have mentioned.  The ancients have tested them in killing worms, and you will find this in the article on cauterization.  Using this device, you will apply ointments and medicines to the ear.  This is its image.
As you see, it is made of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top. If you wish, the nozzle inside the tube can be made of firm copper.  Or, if you wish, take a twisted piece of material and wrap cotton tightly around one end.
Then, place the ointment, juice, or other medicine you wish into the tube while it is in the ear. Then, using the twisted piece with cotton, press gently with your hand until the ointment flows into the cavity of the ear and is felt.
Place it [the medicine] in the ear for the patient, and whatever you pour into the ear should be warmed slightly in fire. Beware that the thing that is being dripped into it is not excessively cold or excessively hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of ear obstruction.
Some children may emerge from their mothers' wombs with their ear canals unpierced.
Some people may also experience an obstruction in the ear canal from a wound or a growing flesh within it. This obstruction may be deep within the ear canal, hidden from sight.
Sometimes it may emerge slightly from the canal and be visible.  The obstruction deep within the ear, unseen, is more difficult to cure in most cases.  If the obstruction is visible, the patient's ear should be placed in the sun. And examine it.  If you see the obstruction externally, then open it with a gentle scalpel.  This is its image:
Its tip should have a slightly limited projection, with the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides to avoid injuring the ear. If the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown within the ear canal, grasp it with a gentle forceps and cut it gently to remove all the flesh.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a smooth, gentle probe, warm it slightly in the fire, and then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction, along with the patient's difficulty hearing, then gently remove it.
Be careful not to injure the eardrum.  Then, place a wick into the ear, fitting it to the size of the canal. Coat it in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days until the wound is safe from adhesion. Or, take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle powdered zeag on it.
Use it. If you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot swelling, the wick should be removed and replaced with another coated in Qirowti, prepared with rose oil, to reduce the hot swelling.  Then treat it until it is healed.
If bleeding occurs, soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear.  Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eight.
On treating warts appearing on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  They should be grasped with a scalpel or a hook and cut away from their roots with a lancet.  Then apply powdered zaga to the area.
If bleeding occurs, cauterize it with a gentle lentil-shaped cauterizing iron.  Cauterization is better after the cutting.  It often returns if anything is left of its roots.  If cauterized with fire, the roots are burned and it will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On treating cold affecting the eyelids.
A condition resembling severe cold often appears on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called "cold," being a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.  If the cold is protruding on the surface of the eyelid and moves in every direction, the treatment is simple: make a transverse incision.
Then gently remove it from every side until it is separated, and hang it by a hook and cut it. If you cannot cut it without penetrating the eyelid, this will not harm the patient.  If the incision is large, bring the edges together with sutures and treat until healed.
If it is small, there is no need to worry; ointment will heal and bring it together. If the cold is inclined towards the inner surface of the eyelid, then turn the eyelid inside out, hook the cold with a hook without needing to cut, and trim it from all sides.
If the eyelid is penetrated during the cutting, this will not harm anything. Then wash the eye with saline water after cutting the cold and treat the area with what will bring the edges together until the patient is healed.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of the stye that appears on the eyelid.
A stye is a swelling that occurs in the layers of the upper eyelid; it most commonly affects children.  It weighs down their eyes, and they experience colds at night and are unable to look at sunlight. Because the tears come quickly to them.
Therefore, they are seen leaning on their faces, and sleeping on them, with their eyelids under their eyebrows moist, swollen, and the stye is clearly visible.  When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the stye between them. The treatment is that the patient should put their head in your lap.
Then, take a linen cloth and prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick, as large as the stye encompasses on all sides.  Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on all sides to gather the stye into the center of the circle.
Then, with the lancet, make a transverse incision in the center of that moisture, an incision no larger than that of a phlebotomy incision.  As for depth, it is necessary to cut through all the skin until you reach the stye.
In most cases, the stye will protrude from the incision as a white piece of fat.  Remove it with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, moving your hand to the right and left until it is cured.  Be careful not to widen the incision so that the lancet does not damage the eye.
If the stye does not appear at the initial incision, you should gently increase the incision slightly until the stye protrudes.  Then remove it as we said.  Then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it over the area, and bandage it gently. Some people crush salt.
Place it in the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture.  Then treat it until it is cured. If a hot inflammation occurs at the site, treat it with cooling compresses until it is cured.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of eye dressings.
If excess eyelashes grow on the eyelid, outside the natural eyelid margin, and persist, they harm the eye and cause various ailments, such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, and inflammation, even to the point of causing blindness.
Eye dressings are of four types: either by cauterization with fire, or by a potent medicine, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or by cutting and stitching, or with a reed, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns, then proceed; otherwise, insert a needle with thread underneath the eyelid, and pierce the eyelid above with the thread, close to the lashes themselves. Pull the thread upward with the eyelid.
Turn it with a spatula, then cut the excess hair from the inside of the eyelid with a sharp lancet from the larger to the smaller margin.  Then, pull out the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid.  Then, bandage the eyelid.
Like the shape of an arum leaf, but the shape should be adjusted to the amount of eyelid elevation needed, as this may vary between individuals; some may require removing a portion of the eyelid proportionate to the degree of relaxation.
Some need a smaller cut; all of this depends on the eyelid's relaxation.  Then cut along the lines you marked, beginning from the larger margin to the smaller, and make each incision near the natural lashes, about the thickness of a spatula.
Then insert a hook into one corner of the skin and peel it all away. Then, bring the edges together with fine, wool thread and stitch them, cleaning the blood, and fastening any remaining threads to the eyebrows with adhesive substances.
You may or may not do this; it is not a concern.  The stitches and threads should remain for about three or four days, then treat it.  Or, if you prefer, leave the wound unsewn and treat it with something that dries and contracts.  The eyelid will rise when the wound is closed. Stitching is preferable.
This method of lifting the eyelid, mentioned by the ancients, requires effort for the patient, but it is a good technique with no risk. Another approach to lifting the eyelid is to shape it like an arum leaf, as described. Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or grouped in this manner.
Then cut off any excess eyelid with a small pair of scissors, in this manner, with precision.
If you cannot hold the hooks in place, or if they do not fit, take a needle with thread, insert it into the center of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger eyelid margin, and a third near the smaller eyelid margin.  Hold the threads with your fingers evenly, then lift the eyelid with a steady hand.
Raise the entire marked skin as described, then close the wound edges with stitches and treat it until healed.  If a hot swelling occurs during cutting or incision, soothe it with a poultice or similar cooling ointment.
The lower eyelid may also turn inward.  In this case, use the cutting, stitching, and cauterization methods previously mentioned.  Cauterization with fire or with a sharp medicine is better and milder for the patient than cutting and stitching; cutting and stitching are more difficult in this case.
Cauterization with reeds is done in this way: turn the eyelid inside out, make the incision on the inside as described, and then make two thin reeds or sticks, the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
Nibble the ends of each reed from both sides where the threads are fastened, then gently gather them together on the remaining part of the eyelid and tightly pull the reeds from both sides.  Leave it for several days, the tightened skin will die, turn black and fester.
Until it falls off of its own accord.  If it is slow, nibble it with a nipper and then treat it until healed. When it has healed, the eyelid will rise and the lashes will not irritate the eye. This is the shape of the two reeds, made to this length and width exactly.
Chapter twelve.
Removing irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
If there is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle, thread it with smooth, fine silk, tie the ends with a very gentle knot, and make the thread about a span long.
Then, attach another, shorter, thin thread to the needle holder. Tie its ends if desired.  The patient should place their head on your lap, close to the light, so the work can be seen, as it is precise.  Then, using the needle and holder, insert it at the base of the extra hair.
And pierce the eyelid quickly, so as to remove the hair from above the natural hair.  Then, pull the thread upward toward the needle holder, and extract the hair, if there are one, two, or three at most.
Then, pull your hand, so that the hair comes out of the eyelid with the needle holder alongside the natural hair.  If pulling the holder does not remove the hair, pull the holder downward with the thread you attached, so that the holder comes out from the upper opening.
Then, replace the hair, and pull both together until they rise to the upper opening, so that you see them clearly. At that point, remove the needle holder and thread.  Press the eyelid and leave it pressed for two or three days, until the hair is fixed in place, and the flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add a longer hair from the natural hair, so it is lifted with it, or leave it until it grows longer later and then remove it.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the stye that occurs in the upper eyelid.
This stye, which is called "arniyya," may be either natural or accidental.  The accidental stye results from an abscess, a wound, a burn, or similar causes.
The procedure involves incising the abscess, separating its edges, and inserting a linen thread between them, tying it off until it heals.  Things that dry and contract should not be used in its treatment.
If you do this, the stye will return worse than before. Instead, use things that relax it, such as fenugreek, a poultice of ground hellebore in boiled water, flax seed, and a diachylon ointment mixed with some oils, and apply this to the thread and treat with it.
The goal of its treatment is to prevent it from adhering in the same way as before, by all means. This method we described is only part of correcting the stye, not restoring the area to its original condition.
Fourteenth Chapter.
On treating the stye that is in the lower eyelid.
This stye, which originates from the lower part, is truly called a stye.  It can be natural or accidental.  Accidental styes arise from wounds, cuts, burns, and the like.
The method is to take a needle with a double thread, insert it into the flesh, piercing from the inner to the outer canthus, until the thread is on both sides of the flesh. Then, pull the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, then stop. Otherwise, take a thread and place it over the wound. Turn the eyelid and make two incisions on the inside of the eyelid, positioned at the corners of the cut, so that they meet and form an angle. So that when they meet, its shape will resemble this shape:
Then, remove the flesh until the sharp side is below the eyelid.  Then gather the separated parts with two stitches using a wool thread.  Then treat it with the relaxing and astringent medications we have mentioned until it heals.
If the ulceration occurred from a cut, stitch, or cauterization, then a simple incision should be made, avoiding the eyelashes, as mentioned before.  Then separate the lips with astringent, as previously described.
In short, when treating an ulceration, whether on top or bottom, perform the procedure according to the appearance of the ulcer.  Its presentation can vary greatly, and the skilled surgeon should devise a solution by any possible means.
Until the shape returns to, or approaches, its natural form. The disease itself will indicate the appropriate treatment and tools in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion can affect many people, causing the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, hindering its free movement and normal function.  A slender probe should be inserted under the eyelid.
Lift it upward or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not as sharp as surgical scalpels, but rather somewhat blunt, so as not to disturb the patient during the procedure and prevent the scalpel from slipping and injuring the eye with its sharpness; your cut should be like peeling away the adhesion.
Then wait until the eyelid returns to its normal position and the adhesion is completely healed. At that point, instill salt water into the eye to wash it or drop a solution of zinc sulfate in water from the eyedropper. Then, separate the eyelid and eye with a linen thread.
Place wet cotton wool soaked in egg white over the eye. After three days, use eye lotions until healed.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the excision of the nail and deep flesh growths.
The nail is of two types: either nervous, resembling a hard, thin membrane, or non-nervous, resembling a white, solid moisture that breaks apart if touched with iron or attempted to be grasped with a forceps.
A forceps does not hold onto either type.  Both types begin from the greater eyelid, gradually spreading until they cover the eye and obstruct the light and the movement of the eye.  The procedure for removing them is for the patient to rest their head on your lap.
Then, the patient opens their eyes, and you raise the eyelid with your hand. Then, you grasp the nail with a slightly curved forceps, pull it upward, take a needle, thread a horse or cow hair and strong thread through it, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and insert it into the center of the nail.
Pierce it with the needle, tie the nail with the thread, pull it upward, and peel away the side of the nail closest to the pupil with the hair, as if spreading it out with the hair until the end. Then cut the remaining portion at the root of the eyelid with a gentle scalpel or small scissors, leaving the natural eyelid tissue intact.
So that cutting it does not cause persistent tearing. The nail may be pulled with forceps alone or with the thread, as we said, then the smooth side, which has this shape, is peeled away with the scalpel.
Take care to avoid the scalpel touching the corneal membrane, lest it cause a rupture and damage the pupil. After the incision, place some powdered salt or antimony powder into the eye and leave it for another day, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle or grip it with forceps, this type of nail is often treated with medication and heals as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, blunt scalpel, of this shape. Gently scrape the nail from above, using it. If you see that it is crumbling and breaking, and the scraping has only produced an effect, place a drop of antimony powder, or red powder, or powdered salt into the eye from your vessel and bandage the eye for another day.
Then repeat the procedure until all of it is gone. However, if a hot swelling appears in the eye, leave it alone and treat the hot swelling until it heals, then resume the scraping until it heals. And as for the flesh tumor...
If the growth is causing excessive pain to the eye, grip it with forceps, and cut away some of it. Do not overdo the cutting lest you cause excessive tearing. Then, instill red or antimony powder into the depths until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting the growths and excess flesh that grows in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red, piled-up flesh may grow, obscuring the sight, or nearly reaching or overflowing onto the eyelids, and perhaps the eyelids turned outward, resembling a rose.
The procedure is to have the patient place their head on your lap, then open their eyes, and use suitable forceps to grasp all of the red flesh.
Or grasp it with a scalpel or a curette, then cut the flesh bit by bit until it is all removed, and protect the eye so it is not harmed during the work; your cutting may be done with the scalpel that we described in cutting the nail, or with small scissors. Like those used to pick out thorns, as their image will appear in the following chapter.
Once the cutting is complete and all the flesh is gone, fill the eye with powdered salt or instill a red or similar corrosive medicine, and apply a white of egg bandage externally to protect against inflammation.
If any flesh remains, and blood predominates, and you fear inflammation, leave the eye and treat it with a remedy to alleviate the inflammation, then return to the procedure until healed.  Do the same with any excess flesh appearing in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye by nature or by manifestation with surgery, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the organ is capable of that procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the excision of the eye's vessels.
The vessels are red veins that weave across the eye, hindering the eye's ability to see and weakening it over time.  First, you must observe; if the eye containing the vessels is strong and has no other ailment besides the vessels,
Then, the excision is performed by having the patient rest their head on your lap, and you should tie the veins with one or two fine curved forceps, as illustrated here:
or two forceps joined together as illustrated here:
Then, gently cut the vessels with fine scissors, wiping away the blood periodically until you see the eye clear of the veins and the blood has stopped flowing.  Protect the eye, avoiding injury with the scissor tips.  Perform the procedure in the middle of the day, in the sunlight.
Be very careful in your work not to cut anything except the vessels.  When finished, apply green or red ophthalmic astringent to the eye to consume any remaining vessels.  If you are unable to remove all the vessels at this time, bandage the eye to relieve any pain.
Leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and the inflammation is relieved. Then repeat the procedure exactly as before until the eye is healed.  This is the image of the scissors used in this procedure.
Leave it [and let the head of the patient rest on the student's lap, another student wiping away tears and examining the front and back of the eye; and you],  the method in this procedure is to open the eye using fixed or triangular forceps held by a student.
Carefully, with the patient's head resting on the student's lap, and another student wiping away tears and examining the front and back of the eye. You have the option to begin cutting from the top or bottom of the eye.  It is preferable to first remove two vessels at the top of the eye, one at the end of the eyelid and the other at the beginning.
Hold the forceps between the middle and index fingers, then place forceps underneath them.  Then hold the forceps between the ring and little fingers, and gently remove your hand so you can see all the vessels lifted. Cut them with scissors if you wish, or with a fine scalpel.
Insert the needle into the vessel and probe all the vessels until they are raised above the membrane. Do not cut the vessels that are not raised, as tears and blood will make it difficult (get blurry).
Then cut with scissors any excess tissue above and below the eyelid so that only the cornea remains exposed. If possible, lift the vessels off the cornea using the probe; this is better, and may be achievable in some cases.
If you cut it, it will sting for a few days, alleviate pain and inflammation, and then the operation can be repeated.
Chapter Nineteen.
In restoring the nasal septum.
If physicians call the septum a "nasura," and treatment with cauterization or strong, burning medicine, as previously described, fails to cure it, the only recourse is to incise the swelling when it is ripe, and extract all the moisture or pus within.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see decay or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
The instrument, called the "khashna ra's," is made of Indian iron, and its head is round like a button.  It is engraved with fine lines like a file or a scraper.  Place it on the decayed area of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while slightly clenching your hand, until you know that the decay has been scraped away.
Repeat this several times, then bind the area with dried, astringent medicines.  If the area heals, flesh grows, the discharge stops, and forty days pass without recurrence, or any discharge or incident,
Then know that it is cured.  Otherwise, there is no recourse but to return the nasura to the nasal passage in this manner: expose the bone again with iron or a caustic medicine.  Once the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The tip of the iron is triangular, and its shaft is a tapered cone narrowing towards the tip, as you see.  Place it on the bone itself, near the nares, keeping your hand a little away from the eye.  Then turn your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
By feeling air escaping from it when he holds his hand over his nose.  At that point, bind the area with astringent, dried medicines, as I instructed you.  If flesh grows and the area hardens, then the material that was protruding outwards will return to the nose, and this will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On the repositioning of a protruding eye.
If the entire eye has protruded and there is no harm or loss in sight, the patient should be eased, then squeezed by the temples, and then a cupping glass should be placed on the back of the head without any specific condition, and it should be cupped gently.
Then apply a compress made of acacia, aloes, frankincense, and henna to the eye.  Then the eye is bandaged from above with numerous strips; the method for making these strips is to take many soft strips of cloth and fold each into four layers, creating many such strips.
Then place them one over the other, as much as the eye needs, and bind them firmly with a strong cloth.  Return to cupping the area without any special conditions, then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the ligament relaxes during this time, it should be tightened firmly.  Then, remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said.  If you see the eye has returned, then leave it.  Otherwise, repeat the bandage, the strips, the tightening, and the cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cutting the optic nerve.
If a rupture occurs in the sclera, then protrudes and emerges outside the eyelids like an optic nerve, thus disfiguring the appearance of the human being, and you wish to cut it, then proceed as I describe.
Insert a needle into the base of the optic nerve from below to above. Then insert another needle, with a doubled thread from the side of the eyelid, and pierce it. Leave the first needle as it is.
Then cut the point where the doubled thread is folded, and tie part of the optic nerve around the needle and tighten it well. Then remove the needle and apply wool soaked in egg white to the eye, and leave it until the threads fall with the optic nerve. Then treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  The optic nerve may be pulled from all sides with a circular bandage of cloth, so that the eye protrudes well.  Then, use a thin scalpel to reach the depths of the eye, so the albuminous moisture drains and the eye drops and withers.  Then, tighten it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-two.
On the treatment of the entrapment.
This affliction, called entrapment, is a congestion that gathers in the eye, resembling flowing water but without it.  The method of treatment is that the patient sits upright on a chair, and then you take their head by the two sides with your hands.
And move it so that you see the congestion move downwards with your eyes. Then, hold it steady, so it doesn't move, and the light will emerge, and the patient will see things as they used to. If the congestion doesn't move downwards, we know it is water. If the congestion doesn't descend as described.
Otherwise, have the patient sit before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision above the cornea, near where the membrane joins the cornea at the limbus, so that the material may be expelled.
Then, after the material is expelled, instill warm water into the eye, possibly mixed with honey, or water in which licorice and honey have been boiled.  Then, treat with the rest of the treatment until healed.
The twenty-third chapter.
We have already described the types of water in the classification, and which are suitable for instillation, with detailed explanations.  You should take that information for accuracy.  Then, the patient should sit before you, seated facing the light, near the sun.
Tie and firmly secure his healthy eye.  Then, raise the eyelid with your left hand if it is the left eye that has the water, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then, place the tip of the cupping vessel close to the limbus, with a slight pressure, on the white part of the eye near the smaller canthus, and push the cupping vessel forcefully while rotating it in your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel that the cupping vessel has reached an empty space.
The cupping vessel should penetrate to a depth equal to the distance from the child's eye to the edge of the pupil (the limbus).  The copper vessel should be seen clearly by the observer because of the clarity of the cornea. Then, bring the cupping vessel back up to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards repeatedly.  If the water descends at that time, the patient will see what has been revealed to his sight at that moment, and the cupping vessel is in his eye.  Then rest a while. If the water ascends, then lower it again without removing the cupping vessel.
If it settles and does not rise, remove the cupping vessel gently, twisting your hand a little bit at a time.  Then dissolve a bit of clear, fine Andranian salt in water, and wash the eye with it from the inside.  Then apply a moistened compress or cloth to the entire outside of the eye.
With rose oil and egg white, and bind the sound eye to it.  As for us and people of our time, we apply crushed cumin with egg white. If the cupping vessel does not enter the eye due to its hardness (because some people have very hard eyes),... One should take the scalpel, called a *bayrid*, which has this shape/form:
Pierce only the adhered part with it, do not go deep into the piercing.  Instead, lightly touch the cupping vessel at a gentle spot, then insert the cupping vessel as we described. When your work is complete, prepare a firm bed for the patient, having them lie on their back in a dark room.
He must refrain from all movements and coughing.  Give him food that softens his nature, and do not allow him to move his head to either side at all.  Keep the bandage in place for three days.  Then remove it in that dark room and test his sight.
Show him objects, then replace the bandage for seven days.  You should not do this during the treatment or after the cupping from your time, but rather should avoid it before the water rapidly ascends due to intense staring.
If a hot swelling appears, then you should remove the bandage before the seventh day and treat it with whatever calms the swelling.  Once it has subsided, then release his sight. Place a veil over his face that trains his sight from underneath for a number of days while he is in the dark room.  Then...
He is gradually released from the room and allowed to manage his affairs. Know that a learner cannot dispense with observing the cupping process multiple times before undertaking the procedure.  It has reached my ears that some Iraqis say they make a suction cupping device in Iraq to draw out water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make this, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients.  It may be a recent innovation.  Here are pictures of different types of cupping devices so that he may understand them better.
They are made of copper, specifically, and their tip is precisely this thin, triangular, pointed shape.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
For the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Various superfluous growths can sprout in the nose, some resembling many-legged scorpions, others cancerous, hard, and dark-colored flesh, and others soft flesh, not dark-colored.
For those growths that are soft, neither malignant nor cancerous, the patient should sit before you in the sun, open their nostril, and insert a hook into the flesh.  Then pull it outward and cut off what you have grasped with a gentle, sharp scalpel, on one side only.
So that you know all of the flesh is gone.  If anything remains that you cannot cut, scrape it away gently with a suitable instrument, so that nothing is left, lest there be excessive bleeding or a hot swelling.
If it is one of the malignant growths, then quickly cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone.  Then, after the cutting, place a poultice of vinegar and water or drink in the nose.  If the nose opens and moisture flows into the throat.
Then know that it is healed. If the moisture does not flow as expected, know that there is growing flesh inside, on the top of the porous bone, that the cutting instrument did not reach.  In that case, take a thick linen thread.
Tie many knots in it, making each knot the size of a finger or less.  Have the patient maneuver one end of the thread into their nostril, with a smooth instrument or whatever is possible, shaping it like a button. Pull the thread until it reaches the cartilage.
It will come out through the throat.  Often, children do this in schools. It is something easily done by those who wish to do it.  Then, bring together the two ends of the thread, the one that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to dissect the flesh, doing so until you know that the flesh has been cut by the knots of the thread.  Then, remove the thread and apply a medicated thread to the nose after cleaning the blood.  Repeat this for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all remaining flesh.  Then, a lead tube will remain in the nose for some days until healing occurs. If further treatment is needed, use that method.
This is an image of the instrument used to drip ointments and medicines into the nose.
It is made of silver or brass, like a small, open lamp, with a channel as well.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the instrument's applicator flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when warming the ointment or other fluids or substances within.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
A wart often grows on the tip of the nose, enlarging and increasing over time until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and completely remove it, then apply either cauterization or a burning medicine that serves as a cauterization.  If it was not cut off until it grew large, then examine it.  If it is hard, dense, dark in color, and insensitive,
do not treat it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor.  I have often seen that cutting this tumor has resulted in great harm to the patient. If the tumor feels soft, is not dark-colored, and you see that it can be cut completely, exhaust the patient and cut it without hesitation or delay, and treat the area with what dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear. If its connection is severed by a wound or similar injury, know that when a connection in one of these cartilages is severed, the remedy is rarely successful except in some people.
Therefore, if someone presents with such an injury, examine if the wound is fresh with blood. If so, bring together the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.  If the severed connection has separated its edges and each gap is complete, then each gap should be scraped with the thickness of the visible skin until it bleeds.
Then bring the edges together with sutures, tighten them, and dust them with pulverized myrrh and frankincense. Place over this a plaster of palm ointment or another adhesive ointment. Leave it tight for two or three days, then remove it.
Change the medication and leave it until the threads come loose on their own. Then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to bring together the severed connection either with needles, as described in the suturing of the abdomen, or with thread, as previously explained.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
For removing the knots that appear on the lips.
Many people may have small, hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling carbuncles, and some smaller or larger.  It is necessary to turn back the lip and cut open each knot, and to remove it with forceps.
Cut it from every side, then fill the area after cutting with powdered alum to stop the bleeding.  Then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas with something astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
In cutting excess flesh in the gums.
Often excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called "apoles."  It should be grasped with forceps or tweezers, cut at its base, and allowed to bleed.  Then, powdered alum should be applied to the area.
Or one of the astringent, dried powders. If that flesh returns after treatment, it often does.  Cut it again, and cauterize it.  It will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-nine.
In scraping teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and out, and between the gums.  They may turn dark, yellow, or green, leading to decay of the gums and unsightly teeth.
The patient should be seated before you, with their head resting on your lap.  Scrape the tooth or teeth showing scales and sand-like material until none remains.  Likewise, remove any dark, green, or yellow discoloration until clean.
If the initial scraping removes all the debris, well and good.  Otherwise, repeat the scraping the next day, and again on subsequent days, until the desired result is achieved.  Know that different types of scrapers, various in shape and form, are needed according to the task at hand.
Because the scraper used to clean inside the tooth is different from the scraper used for the outside, and the scraper used between the teeth is yet another form.  These are various types of scrapers that should be available.
Chapter Thirty.
On the extraction of teeth.
One should attempt to treat the toothache by every means before resorting to extraction, for there is no remedy if it is extracted since it is a noble substance; even if extraction is unavoidable.
Therefore, if the patient is determined to have the tooth extracted, one must first ensure that the toothache is fully resolved. Often, the patient is misled by the pain, believing it is in a healthy tooth and extracting it.  Then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted; we have seen this happen repeatedly with the actions of cuppers.
If the toothache is precisely located, then one should make an incision around the tooth with a strong scalpel so that the gum is loosened on every side.  Then, one should gently move it with fingers or delicate forceps, little by little, until it is loosened.
Then, firmly grasp the tooth with large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees, ensuring it does not move.  Then, pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of those instruments and gently insert it underneath the tooth from all sides, moving it as you did initially.
If the tooth is carious or decayed, one should fill the cavity with a cloth and seal it tightly with a thin, smooth piece of material so that it does not break apart when you pull on it with the forceps.  Carefully make an incision around the gum from all sides, thoroughly.
Exercise caution to avoid breaking it, for a piece remaining will cause the patient greater suffering than the initial pain.  Do not do what the ignorant cuppers do, in their haste and rashness, extracting the tooth without using the methods we have described.
Frequently they inflict great calamities upon people, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving the roots, all or part of them. Or, they may pull out some of the jawbone, as we have repeatedly observed.  Then, the patient should rinse the area with a drink or vinegar and salt.  If bleeding occurs from the area, as often happens, crush some alum and apply it to the area.
Otherwise, if the alum is not effective, use the fine forceps, which should first be used to move the tooth.  The forceps should have long tips and short handles, and be thick so that they do not bend when you grip the tooth with them.  This is a picture of the large forceps.
They should be, as you see, thick-handled, so that when you grip them, they do not yield or bend.  Their tips should be short.  Let them be made of Indian iron or tempered steel, with the tips firmly riveted.  At the tip, let there be teeth that interlock securely.
The tips may also be shaped like a file, making them equally strong and precise.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On extracting the roots of teeth and removing fractured jawbones.
If, when extracting a tooth, a root has broken off, you should place a piece of cloth soaked in oil on the area for a day or two to allow the area to relax, then introduce a forceps or pliers. Which resembles the beak of a bird called a bulgerge, and this is an image of the pliers.
If it has been fashioned like a rasp from the inside or like a scraper, and if this does not allow you to remove it with these pliers, you should chisel on the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, and then insert the instrument which resembles a small lever, this is its image.
Short at the end, slightly thick, and not be too sharp so as not to break it. If the root comes out with that, then use these other tools which have this image; the first one is triangular at the end with some thickness.
Image of another delicate triangular one.
And we may also make use of this two-pronged instrument, which also has this image.
And with other instruments and tools which are mentioned in the description of the teeth, and we may also make use of this instrument which resembles a large fishhook, this is its image.
Triangular and curved at the end, with some slight thickness so as not to break, and not be too sharp. And know that the instruments for teeth are numerous, as well as the other instruments, which are almost countless.  A skillful craftsman in his craft may invent instruments for himself, according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate.
Because there are diseases for which the ancients did not describe instruments, due to the variety of their types. If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth breaks or becomes diseased, search for it in its place with whatever is suitable of these instruments and pliers mentioned in the extraction of the roots.
And we use the forceps, this is its image.
It should have some slight thickness to hold the bone firmly so that it does not slip until the bone is removed.  We treat the area with appropriate medications.  If the bone has a slight decay, remove the decay and discoloration until it is clean, and then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-two.
In the eruption of teeth on top of others.
Teeth that erupt contrary to their natural course disfigure the appearance, especially in women and slaves.  It is necessary to examine if the tooth has erupted behind another tooth.
If it cannot be moved or straightened, remove it. If it is adhering to another tooth, cut it with this instrument, of which this is a picture.
It resembles a small beak, made of sharp, Indian iron. Cut it over many days, due to the tooth's hardness, to avoid disturbing the other teeth. If it is protruding and firmly rooted, cool it with a file of Indian make, of this shape.
It should be entirely of Indian make, very delicately engraved, like the file used to make needles.  Cool the tooth gradually over many days gently, so as not to dislodge and cause it to fall. Then smooth it afterwards and scrape it with certain scrapers.
If a tooth has broken off a piece, causing the tongue to be irritated when speaking, it should also be cooled until the roughness of the fracture is removed, it becomes smooth and level, and no longer irritates the tongue or disrupts speech.
Thirty-third Chapter.
In wiring loose teeth with silver or gold thread.
If older teeth become loose and displaced due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot eat anything for fear of their falling out, and treatment with astringent remedies has proved ineffective.
The solution is to tie them with gold or silver thread.  Gold is better, as silver tarnishes and rots after a few days, whereas gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of medium thickness and thinness, appropriate for the space between the teeth.
The method of wiring is to take the thread and pass its bend between the sound teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, one or more, until you reach the sound tooth on the other side.
Then weave back to where you began, gently and skillfully tightening the thread so that it doesn't move.  The thread should be tightened at the roots of the teeth to prevent slippage. Then, cut the excess thread with scissors, bring the ends together and twist them, concealing them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
To avoid injuring the tongue.  Leave it tight until needed.  If it loosens or breaks, strengthen it with another thread.  Thus, the teeth will remain secure throughout their lifetime.  This is the method of wiring teeth, between two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
A single or two teeth may be returned to their place after falling out and wired as described, and the tooth will remain in place. This is the work of a skilled craftsman.  A craftsman may also carve bone from a cow's bone to create a tooth-like shape and place it where the tooth was missing. And it is tightened, as we said, so it remains secure.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On severing the ligament that lies beneath the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament beneath the tongue may be either natural, a condition present at birth, or accidental, resulting from a healed wound.
The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth, holding their head in your lap, lifting their tongue, then severing the ligamentous nerve transversely so that the tongue is released from its constraint.  If there is some stiffness or entanglement, and this is from a healed wound, use a probe to pierce and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knot is resolved.
Be careful not to make the incision too deep into the flesh, lest you sever an artery and cause bleeding.  Then, after the incision, have the patient rinse their mouth with rosewater or a mixture of vinegar and cool water.  Then, place a linen thread under the tongue, which the patient must hold in place every night.
To prevent re-adhesion. If bleeding occurs, apply powdered zea to the site. If the bleeding is severe, cauterize the area with a suitable lenticular cautery. Then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
Removing the frog that has developed under the tongue.
A swelling resembling a small frog may develop under the tongue, hindering the tongue's normal function and possibly growing to fill the mouth.  The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth facing the sun and examining the swelling.
If it appears dark or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation, do not attempt treatment, for it is cancer.  If it leans toward whiteness and contains moisture, use a probe to pierce it and carefully dissect it from all sides.
If bleeding occurs during the procedure, apply powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then resume the procedure until the swelling is fully removed.  Then the patient should rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with any other appropriate therapy until healed.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On the treatment of tonsil tumors.
Any tumors that grow in the throat may sometimes present as glands inside the throat, similar to those that appear externally, called tonsils.  If you treat them as described in the classification and they do not heal,
If the tumor is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive, do not use the iron. If it is red and thick, also do not use the iron, for fear of bleeding.  Instead, allow it to mature; it will either soften or burst on its own.
If it is white, round, and thin, this is the one that should be cut.  Before doing so, observe whether the inflammation has completely subsided or if some of the swelling has reduced.
Then, place the patient facing the sun, head in your lap, mouth open.  Take an assistant, who will press the patient's tongue downward with an instrument, which looks like this:
Make it of silver or bronze, thin like a knife.  When you have pressed the tongue and the tumor is clearly visible, take a probe and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it outward as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes along with it.
Then cut it with an instrument, which looks like scissors, but with both ends curved, each tip sharply meeting the other.  Made of Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this instrument is unavailable, cut it with a scalpel, which looks like this:
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other.  After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner.  Then, after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or rue leaves, or similar astringents, have been boiled, until the bleeding stops.  Then treat it until it heals.  Other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils; these are cut in the same way as the tonsils.
I treated a woman for a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a small, hard lump, almost completely blocking her throat.  The woman's breathing was through a narrow passage, and she was unable to eat or drink.
She was close to death if she had remained ill for another day or two.  Two branches had grown from the tumor, emerging through her nostrils.  Acting quickly, I inserted a hook into one and pulled it out, extracting a suitable piece.
Then I cut it where it emerged from the nostril, and did the same with the other nostril.  Then I opened her mouth, pressed her tongue down, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut off a portion.  Only a small amount of blood was released.
The woman's throat opened up, and she immediately drank water and then ate food.  We repeatedly cut away at that tumor over a long period, and it would regenerate after each removal.  This went on for a long time for both of us.
I devised a method of cauterizing the tumor inside the throat, stopping its growth.  Then I left the area and do not know what God did for her afterward.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On the removal of a tumor of the larynx.
If a tumor, called a 'ʿunaba' (or possibly "bunch"), descends into the larynx and swells, and is white and oblong, it is called a 'ʿamūd' (or possibly "column"); if it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called a 'ʿunaba'.  If treated as described in the classification, and the treatment is ineffective.
If the hot tumor has subsided and is thin, it should be cut.  If it is a solid, round mass with no length and is dark-colored (or the color of blood or bruise, or black), and does not feel sensitive, then one should avoid cutting it.
There is danger for the patient, therefore, if you see it with the characteristics of whiteness and length, the patient should sit facing the sun, and hold their tongue with the instrument whose description was previously provided, then the hook should be inserted into the 'ʿunaba'.
Pull it downwards and cut it using one of the two instruments mentioned in the section on tonsil removal.  Only the excess beyond the natural size should be cut, without further removal, as cutting more will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after the cutting, use what we described for the removal of the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is hesitant to have it cut, then one must use a method of cauterizing it without fear or caution.  The method of cauterization is with a sharp medicine, placing the patient's head in your lap.
Then, hold the patient's tongue with the instrument we described, and take the sharp water mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, mix it with quicklime (unquenched), making it neither thick nor thin, filling the hollow of this instrument.  This is its image/form.
The end of the instrument where you place the medicine has a depression like the depression of a mrood spoon.  Place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself. The patient should be lying on their side so that saliva runs from their mouth from inside their throat to prevent anything from falling back into the throat and harming them.
Then, hold the instrument with the medicine and apply pressure to the uvula for about half an hour until you see it has blackened and the burning sensation of the medicine has subsided.  If desired, take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the end of a mrood spoon, and dip the cotton in the medicine.
Insert the mrood with the cotton into a tube from above, so the cotton adheres to the uvula. Repeat this until you have achieved the desired cauterization of the uvula.  Then leave it, and it will wither and fall off in three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, do so.
After the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in ghee, removing any remaining medicine from the area.  Then, the patient gargles with cold water and is treated externally with lotions and internally with gargles until healed.  This type of treatment is safer than cutting and avoids fear.
The uvula can also be treated with something gentler than cauterization or cutting; it can be treated with incense in this way:  Take frankincense, zofar, sage, sḏāb, shih, chamomile, and qaysūm, and similar herbs. Collect them all, or some of them, in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
And simmer it, with the pot covered with earthenware, and a hole in the lid. This hole is fitted with a hollowed instrument, made of silver or copper, in this manner:
Insert the end with the pomegranate into the patient's mouth, so the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, causing the uvula to shrink.  Repeat this several times until it withers.  Be careful not to apply this treatment at the very beginning of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling, and it is better to do this when the hot swelling has subsided.  If this instrument is unavailable, take a reed and fit a chicken egg shell onto its end to prevent the patient's mouth from burning.
Because the egg shell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth. This is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
For removing thorns and other things that lodge in the throat.
Often a bone or fish bone or something else lodges in the throat.  It is necessary to remove what is visible to the eye, after pressing the tongue with the instrument in the sun's light.
So that you may see what is in the throat.  If something is hidden and not visible in the throat, you should induce vomiting in the patient before their food has digested in their stomach.  Perhaps the lodged object will come out with the vomit, or the patient will swallow a piece of linen or a stalk of lettuce.
Or the patient might swallow a piece of dry bread, or take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a thread, and have the patient swallow it.  When it reaches the thorn, pull the thread quickly, doing this several times.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out.  If it does not come out with the methods mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this manner:
It should be slightly thicker than a lead weight.  At its end, there is a curve.  The patient, with their head raised, gently inserts it into their throat, being careful not to touch their throat so as not to cause coughing and thus dislodge the bone or thorn.  Or the physician inserts it with his hand.
Having the patient insert it is better, as they know the location of the lodged object, and they push it downwards or pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all according to what is convenient until it is removed.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
Removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If treatment with the medications described in the previous section proves ineffective, then examine the patient's throat in the light of the sun after pressing their tongue down with the instrument described.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a delicate, firm forceps.  If this is unsuccessful, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech.  Then, insert a heated, protected iron rod into the tube.
Repeat this several times.  The patient should refrain from drinking water all day.  Then, the patient should take a bowl filled with cold water, open their mouth over it, gargle, but not swallow a drop.  The patient should move the water around with their hand from time to time.
If the leech feels the water, it will fall off.  If it does not come out with the methods described, fumigate the throat with urine and hellebore using the instrument described for inhaling remedies.  Do this several times, and it will fall off.
The procedure for fumigation is to take a container with heated embers, the container covered with a lid that has a hole in the middle.  Attach the instrument's tip to this hole.  Then, place the incense in the container, and the patient places their mouth on the end of the tube.  The patient should close their mouth so the incense reaches their throat.
If the leech falls off, that's good. If not, repeat the fumigation multiple times.  The patient should endure thirst and eat salty foods and garlic, but avoid drinking water.  This treatment must remove the leech.  This is an image of the instrument used to remove a leech from the throat when seen.
It resembles tongs, as you see, except for this curve that goes into the throat.  Its tips resemble a bird's beak, rough like a file; if it grasps something, it does not let go.
Another instrument is used to hold the tongue; it is a wide ring of iron, fitting the mouth, placed over the tongue.  It is inserted into the mouth, standing on its side, keeping the mouth open against the patient's will; the patient cannot remove it until it is removed.
Description of the instrument used to open the mouth in this exact manner.
Chapter Forty.
In it, there is discussion about the lancing and incision of tumors.
Tumors are numerous and varied, as will be described one by one in this book.  Their lancing and incision differ in two ways: first, from the type of tumor itself and the humors it contains.
The second way is due to the locations where they occur in the body, since a tumor arising in the head is different from a tumor arising in the buttocks, and a tumor in a fleshy area differs from one in a joint. Each has its own operative approach.
Some tumors should not be lanced until the pus has matured completely.  Others, such as those near the joints, should be lanced while still immature.
Because if a tumor near a joint grows to the point of causing the surrounding tissue to decay, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing the limb to become useless, or the tumor may be near a vital organ.
Because if you delay lancing it until it matures, you will harm the vital organ, or if it is near the buttocks, lance it while still immature.  You should lance a tumor immature and near the buttocks, lest the pus decays and spreads into the rectum, resulting in a fistula.
It will become incurable in some cases.  You should know when to lance tumors that have fully matured:  when the tumor pain subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and other signs improve.
The incision should be made at the lowest part of the tumor, if possible, so the discharge flows downwards more easily, or at the thinnest, most prominent part of the tumor.  If the tumors are on the hands or feet, the incision should follow the length of the limb.
Incisions should be made over muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and generally in all straight, unbent areas.  For bent areas, the incision should follow the shape of the area.  If the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is better to leave it unlanced.
Until it is completely matured, as we said.  If you lance it before then, the pus will flow excessively, causing much harm and filth, and the edges and cavity might become hard. Some tumors may require a transverse incision if necessary, or in keeping with the needs of the affected organ.
Small tumors should be incised once; large tumors, with incisions wide or numerous, depending on the tumor's size. Some tumors may require skin excision if they have become like a torn piece of fabric.
Some have become somewhat necrotic, like those found in many cysts and abscesses.  Some are incised in a three-sided shape; some are cut like a rue leaf, like the tumors of the groin.
Some require circular or crescent-shaped incisions, and others, like smooth, flat tumors without a head, should only be incised simply.  If the tumor is large and has accumulated over time, and you have incised it, do not rush to drain all the pus at once.
Instead, drain some of it, then compress the tumor for another day, then drain some more pus. Repeat this gradually until all is expelled.
Especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a young child, or an elderly person, the animal spirit often weakens with the sudden expulsion of pus.  The patient might die without your realizing it.  Therefore, great caution is required in this matter.
After incising these tumors, you should clean the wound and examine it. If the tumor wound is small or the incision simple, use linen or old cotton for dressings.  If the tumor is large and the incisions numerous,
then you should insert a dressing into each incision until they meet. If part of the skin has been cut or scraped off from the tumor, you should fill it with old cotton or linen fibers without moisture and compress it for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with appropriate ointments until healed.  If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, soaking a linen cloth in them, and apply it repeatedly to the bleeding area.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the treatment and remedies described in many places in this book and in the divisions. If it is winter and the tumor area is sensitive, you should moisten the bandages with a hot drink and oil.
And place them on the area. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply bandages soaked in water and oil or in a cold drink and oil.  When the third day arrives, as we said, you should remove the dressing and clean the tumor.
And use similar treatment until healed.  This is the general knowledge you need for treating tumors.  As for a detailed approach, each tumor has been described with a summarized method of treatment.
Chapter Forty-one.
On incised tumors that appear on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp, a type of swelling contained in sacs; they have characteristics like a hen's egg.  There are many types, some fatty, others containing a moisture like mud.
Some contain a moisture like gruel and soup, and the like.  Others are hardened and solid.  All can be incised and removed without danger, unless an artery is encountered during the incision.
The procedure for incision is to first probe it with the instrument, whose image will follow, called the *midas*, so that you know what it contains.  If it contains moisture, then make a simple longitudinal incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~.  If the moisture has drained, dissect the sac containing the moisture, and remove it completely.  Leave nothing behind, as it often recurs if any part remains.
Then, dip a cotton swab in astringent ointment, if available, or salt water, and apply it to the wound. Leave it for another day, as it will consume any remaining sac tissue. Then, reapply the cotton swab with the astringent a second and third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that no part of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until healed. If the swelling contains fatty tissue, incise it in this manner:
Make a cross-shaped incision, and place forceps on the edges of the wound.  Dissect it from every side and exert all your effort to remove the peritoneum that contains it. If an artery obstructs you, proceed as described previously. Do the same with the swelling if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as previously mentioned.  The incision on hardened swellings is easier because they have little blood and moisture. Some of these swellings in the head, in some people, have no moisture at all. I incised a swelling in...
the head of an elderly woman, and found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone.  It could not be broken, even if someone threw it, it would only be chipped.  Other swellings occurring on the heads, unlike those that appear in children's heads, were not like this.
At the roots of the ears, make a simple incision across the entire area, and place a drain at the bottom to allow the material to flow downwards. Then treat it with the appropriate therapy.
Chapter Forty-two.
On the incision of swine-like swellings that frequently appear in the neck.  These swellings often appear in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins.  They may appear elsewhere on the body.  Those in the neck may be single or multiple, and some may develop from others.
Each such swelling has its own enclosed sac, like in tumors of the head and the like, which we have described.  These swellings are of various types: some are stony, some contain moisture, and some are malignant, unresponsive to treatment.
Of those I observed, some were benign to the touch. Their appearance was close to the skin's color, they moved in all directions, were not attached to the neck's nerves, blood vessels, or veins, and were not deeply embedded. It is necessary to incise it with a simple cut from top to bottom of the body, in this manner, from line ~ج~ to line ~ب~.
One should dissect it from all sides and stretch the edges of the skin with a hook or two, or many hooks, if necessary, as we have described for tumors of the head.  Extract it little by little, taking care not to cut a vein or nerve. The scalpel should not be excessively sharp.
So that your hand does not increase the cutting or the patient becomes distressed, causing you to cut what is not necessary.  If you cut a vein or artery and this hinders your work, place powdered astringent or some styptic powder into the wound.
Close the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides, the wound relaxes, and begins to fester.  The bleeding will stop at that point; resume your work until you are finished. Then, check with your index finger if any remaining, smaller, excrescences remain and cut and remove them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the excrescence, one should not cut the excrescence at its base.  Instead, it is necessary to tie it with a double, strong thread and allow it to fall off by itself without harm. Then, fill the wound with used cotton that has been dipped in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
If the entire excrescence is cut, it is necessary to bring together the edges of the wound and suture it immediately, after ensuring there is no remaining excess.  If you see that an excess from the base of the excrescence remains, however.
Then, you should aim to cut at the base and root of the excrescence and use the sutures and what we have mentioned.  For excrescences containing moisture, apply a simple bandage where the area of ripening shows, placing the bandage on the lower part as we stated.
Then, after the bandage, use compresses with Egyptian ointment, or similar, to consume any remaining corruption.  Once you see the wound is clean, treat it with healing ointments until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On the incision of the throat for a tumor occurring within the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision of the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it.  This is consistent with their words.  However, those with angina should avoid incision of the throat, as it will not benefit them.
In order that all the tumors and the lungs be diseased, and for those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no affliction in the trachea, it is necessary to use incision of the throat to escape the harm that results from suffocation.
Therefore, if we wish to do this, we should cut the throat below three circles of the trachea, or four small cuts across between two circles, as much as the incision would be in the diaphragm, not in the cartilage.  This location is suitable for the incision.
Because it is without flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it, if the surgeon is timid, he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook and then cut the skin until, when it reaches the trachea, he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the diaphragm that we described, and he should determine the incision of the trachea from the phlegm that comes out of it, along with what is squeezed out, and from the cessation of sound.  He should leave the wound open for a time.  Then, when the time that suffocation was feared has passed, he should bring the edges of the wound together.
And he cuts it alone, apart from the cartilage.  Then the medicines that promote flesh growth are used until it heals.  The author of this book said, explaining the meaning of this passage we have recounted, it is only when they see the patient's throat obstructed by one of these tumors of which we spoke.
When the patient was near death, and was about to suffocate, they went to cut the throat so that the patient could breathe through the wound and be saved from death.  However, they were instructed to leave the wound open until the course of the illness was completed.  The course of the illness is about three days or similar.
At that point, they ordered the wound to be stitched and treated until it healed.  What I myself saw was that a servant took a knife and ran it across her throat, cutting a portion of her lung's trachea.  I was called to treat her, and I found her weakening as if she had been sacrificed.  I uncovered the wound.
I found little blood coming from the wound, so I was certain that she had not cut a vein or artery.  Air was coming from the wound.  I quickly sutured the wound and treated it until it healed.  The servant experienced nothing except a hoarse voice; no more.
And after some days, she returned to her best condition.  Therefore, we say that cutting the throat involves no danger.
Chapter Forty-four.
On the incision of the tumor appearing on the larynx from the outside, called the "luminous larynx.
This tumor, called the luminous larynx, is a large tumor the color of the body. It is common in women and comes in two types.
Either it is natural or it is a sign.  As for the natural one, there is no remedy.  As for the sign, it is of two types: one resembling fatty tumors, and the other resembling a tumor resulting from a blood vessel's entanglement.  There is danger in cutting it. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use iron on it at all, unless it is small. If, upon probing and examining it with a probe, it is found to resemble a fatty tumor and is not connected to any vessels, then cut it as you would cut a tumor. Remove it with whatever sac it is contained in if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove all of it. Then treat the area with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-five.
On cutting various tumors.
Tumors are numerous, and all their types have been mentioned in the classification.  Here we must explain the difference between a tumor and an abscess, as this is problematic.  I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat, fever, and fearful pains until the inflammation subsides. The pus completes its formation, and then the fever and severity subside. A tumor is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain.  It is contained within a serous sac, a special enclosure.  It is the color of the body, its initial stage like a blister, and it develops into a lump of various sizes.
It comes in two types: either fatty or containing moisture.  The colors of moisture are numerous, as mentioned in the classification.  Therefore, when treating a tumor, one must first probe and examine it with the instrument called a `midas` (or `medas`), as its image will be presented in the next chapter.
Assess the size of the tumor.  Then remove the `midas` and observe what follows.  If flowing moisture of any color emerges, incise it simply as described in other tumors.  If no moisture emerges after using the `midas`, know it to be fatty.
Incise it with a firm incision as I have taught you, suspend it with hooks, and gently peel the skin from all sides.  If possible, preserve the sac containing the tumor intact.
If the sac breaks during the procedure and you cannot remove it intact, which often happens, remove it in pieces until nothing remains, for if any part remains, large or small, the tumor will likely return.
If you are unsuccessful and a small part remains, cauterize the wound thoroughly with sharp cauterizing materials, and compress the wound. Apply a treatment to soothe the inflamed tumor and treat it with other methods until it heals. If the tumor is large, suture its edges and treat them with a method for healing.
If a vein, affected or unaffected, causes bleeding, immediately apply powdered alum to the affected area and leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound is suppurated and the bleeding subsides, then proceed to remove any remaining part of the tumor.
Chapter Forty-six.
In the figures of instruments.
The instruments used for cutting and crushing; figures of the spatulas. There are three types: large, medium, and small.
Figure of a large spatula.
Figure of a medium spatula.
Figure of a small spatula.
Made of tempered steel, square at the ends, firm to quickly enter tumors.  These are figures of probes, called "bard".  There are also three types: large, medium, and small.  Figure of a large probe.
Figure of a medium probe.
Figure of a small probe.
Suitable for searching tumors, wounds, sinuses, and cavities for bones and other contents within.  Made round, polished, and smooth like whetstones, from Chinese brass, or isabard, or from copper, or iron, or silver. The best is made from isabard.
Probes may also be made of black lead, suitable for probing sinuses that have a bend in their depths, as it will flex with that bend.  There are also three types: long, medium, and short.
According to the need of each sinus' depth, its thickness should be according to the sinus' width and narrowness.  Figure of a large lead probe.
Figure of a medium lead probe.
Figure of a small lead probe.
Figures of forceps, which are numerous types. Some are simple, meaning they have one hook, and these come in three types: large, medium, and small. Others are blind forceps, and these come in three types.  And others are double-hooked forceps, which are three types, and others are double-hooked curved forceps. And these are three types.  And from them are three-hooked forceps, which are three types.  All of these types require their own specific location.  Figure of a large simple forceps. Figure of a medium simple forceps. Figure of a small simple forceps.
Figure of a large blind forceps. Figure of a medium blind forceps.
Figure of a small blind forceps.
Figure of a large forceps with two hooks. Figure of a medium forceps with two hooks. Figure of a small forceps with two hooks.
Figure of a large forceps with three hooks.
Figure of a medium forceps with three hooks. Figure of a small forceps with three hooks.
These are images of the scalpels used to cut and excise tumors and swellings.  There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its cutting edges are limited, while the other ends are not.  This was done so that it could be used to excise the swelling when there is fear of cutting a nerve or artery, and so that the patient might be relieved a little from the burning sensation experienced when excising the tumor.
These are images of the retractors.  There are three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large retractor.
It is made of polished brass, similar to that used for eye makeup.  On one end is a wide, two-layered spoon-like object.  Hidden within the head is a scalpel blade, resembling a bird's tongue, which extends in and out as desired.
Images of the blunt-ended surgical knives used to incise tumors between the fingers, so the patient does not feel them. There are three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large scalpel.
Images of cupping instruments used to draw blood. There are three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large cupping instrument.
Made of brass or china, slightly elongated and rounded, as you see.  And thin.  You should have these types of cupping instruments, both large and small, to draw blood quickly when needed, and when medicine is unavailable.
But they are not used to draw blood from every part of the body.  They are used in fleshy areas, such as the leg and thigh muscles, arm muscles, breast, abdomen, and groin, and similar moist fleshy organs.
And smaller instruments like pistachio shells can be made from them, like this image.
Blood is drawn with them if it flows from a venesection site, or when a vein or artery is cut.  A round one can also be made, like this image.
Chapter Forty-seven.
On treating the breast of men.
Some people's breasts may swell at puberty, becoming like women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly.  If someone dislikes this, the breast should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision, like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with the medicated ointment. Then stitch the edges of the wound together and treat it until healed. If the breast sags and relaxes due to the weakening of its structure, as happens in women.
One should make incisions in its upper sides, two incisions resembling crescent shapes, each connecting to the other at their ends, so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one, in this manner. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then the skin between the incisions is peeled away, the fat removed, and the previously mentioned stitching, dressings, and any necessary treatment are used until healed.
If the cutting did not remove what you should have cut due to the patient's distress or bleeding, you should fill the wound with cotton dipped in the corrosive ointment and leave it to consume the remaining fat. Then treat it until it heals.
The Forty-eighth Chapter.
On treating tumors appearing under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the pig-like type, solid, contained within a sac. Some contain moisture.  Those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, like this.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~.  If you have emptied all the material from the tumor, pack it with used cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until healed. If the tumor is of the "knotted pig" type, incise it as we described in the section on pig-like tumors. If the wound continues to form pus, use cautery as described previously.
Chapter Forty-nine.
In the incision of a tumor that appears near an artery or vein, and is called an aneurysm.
If an artery is wounded and the skin above it adheres, a tumor often appears.  Similarly, a vein may also develop a swelling and tumor.
The signs by which one knows whether the swelling and puffiness are from an artery or a vein:  If the swelling is from an artery, it is oblong and compact within the body's depth. If you press the swelling with your finger, you feel a crackling sensation.
The swelling from a vein is round and on the surface of the body.  Incision on these tumors is dangerous, especially in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many other parts of the body if they are very large.  One should avoid treating them with iron.
Also, those in the extremities or head should be avoided.  If it is a swelling of the artery's mouth, make a lengthwise incision in the skin, then open the incision with hooks.  Then, dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and pierce it to the other side.  Tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I explained to you regarding the arteries in the neck.  Then, pierce with a lancet the place between the ligaments until all the blood is released.
The swelling will subside. Then use a treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall away.  Then treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from a torn vein, you should grasp as much of the swelling with the skin as possible. Then insert a needle below the area you grasped and pierce it through, with a doubled thread inside, until you bring it out from the other side. Then tie the swelling firmly, as I described to you in tying the hernia at both ends with the thread ends. If you fear the threads might slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling where the first needle intersects.
Tie your threads in four places, then cut the swelling open in the middle.  When the contents come out, cut away excess skin and leave what was tied. Then apply a poultice dipped in a mixture of liquid and oil. Then use a treatment of twisting and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
Concerning the swelling that arises from nerve twisting.
Just as swelling occurs in the artery and vein, so too does swelling occur in the nerve if struck or caused by excessive exertion, or similar. This is most common in the wrists and ankles.
And in every place where joints move, it is a hard swelling, similar in color to the rest of the body.  It is mostly painless.  If pressed firmly, the afflicted person feels a sensation similar to numbness.  The swelling is not deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in all directions, but not forward or backward.  If it is in the joints, it should not be treated with iron, as it may cause a festering sore.  The same applies to those found on the head or forehead.
Cut the skin with a scalpel.  If the swelling is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from the root.  If it is large, suspend it with a hook, scrape it, then remove it. Close the wound with stitches and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On cutting warts that appear on the abdomen.
Warts, called fungal due to their resemblance to fungi, often appear on the abdomens and other parts of the body of some people.  Their base is thin and their head thick, and their lips may be fused.  They may be small or very large.
I observed a man with two warts on his abdomen, resembling fungi in every way.  Their thin, whitish base had fused together and was constantly weeping moisture. I cut them, and their weight amounted to approximately eighteen ounces for one and approximately six ounces for the other.
If the lesion is moist and the wart is white, moist, and thin-based, cut it with a broad scalpel.  Have heated cauterizing instruments available, as a great deal of blood often flows when they are cut.
If you are overwhelmed by blood, cauterize it.  If the affected area is sensitive and recoils from cutting with the knife, take a firm lead thread and tie it tightly around the wart. Leave it for two days, then continue tightening the lead thread.
As the lead thread tightens upon the wart, it will eventually detach and fall off without difficulty.  If the wart has a thick base, cutting it carries some risk and danger, particularly if located on the abdomen.  However, it may be possible to cut it in half or in part.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat the wound until it heals.  Beware of cutting a wart that is dark-colored, insensitive, and dull-looking, as this may be a cancerous tumor.  We will discuss cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-two.
On treating umbilical protrusions.
Umbilical protrusions can arise from various causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum lining the abdomen, which allows the intestines or viscera to protrude, as happens in other hernias; or from blood emanating from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from accumulated gas.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of the viscera, the tumor will be the same color as the body, soft without pain, and will have an irregular shape. If it is due to protrusion of the intestines, its shape will be even more irregular than what we described. When you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns, and it may be accompanied by rumbling. It will also increase considerably during bathing and strenuous activity. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
If it does not disappear when pressed with your hand, and does not increase or decrease, then if it is from blood, the tumor will appear dark in addition to these symptoms. If it is from overgrown flesh, the tumor will be hard and firm, remaining at the same level.
If it is due to gas, its touch will be soft.  The treatment in such a case is to observe; if the umbilical protrusion is due to arterial or venous blood, or gas, one should refrain from treating it, as there is danger and deception in that, as I informed you in the chapter where I discussed tumors arising from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to intestines or viscera, you should instruct the patient to hold himself still and stand upright, stretched out. Then, mark with ink around the entire umbilicus. Then, instruct him to lie on his back before you.  Then, make a wide incision around the umbilicus, at the spot marked with ink.  Then, pull the center of the tumor upwards with a large hook. Then, tie the incision site securely with strong thread or fine silk.
The knot of the bandage should be a slip-knot. Then, open the center of the constricted tumor above the bandage and insert your index finger, feeling for the intestines. If you find that the bandage has grasped the intestines, loosen the slip-knot and push the intestines back into the abdomen.  If you find a viscus, draw it out with a hook.
Cut off the excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, tie it securely and return to your work. Take two needles, insert two strong threads into them, and insert the needles into the incision you made around the tumor, firmly penetrating it. Then, tighten the tumor at four points on the needles.
If you prefer, remove the needles and leave the area until the tightened flesh becomes gangrenous and falls off on its own, or cut it if it becomes thin and gangrenous. Then, treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical protrusion is from flesh that has grown there.
Or, if it is from moisture, you should cauterize the tumor, as we said, and remove the blood or moisture you find there. Then treat it with what will heal the area.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have previously described the types of cancer and how to treat them with medicine, and warned against treating them with iron, lest they become ulcerated.  We have also mentioned cancer originating in the uterus and warned against treating it.
The ancients stated that if the cancer is in a place where it can be completely excised, such as in the breast or the thigh, and similar excisable organs, especially if it is small and newly developed, it should be removed completely. However, if it has progressed and is large, it should not be approached.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve this.  If it is located in a suitable place, as we said, proceed with cupping to draw out the black humor repeatedly, then cauterize it if there is a clear fullness in the veins.
Then apply cupping in a way that allows treatment to take effect, then place the appropriate probes onto the cancer and cauterize it from all sides, including the skin, thoroughly, until nothing of its origins remains. Allow the blood to flow, do not stop it quickly.
Instead, squeeze the affected areas and release all the thick blood with your hand or any suitable instruments. If during the procedure a large amount of blood is released from a severed artery or vein, cauterize the affected area until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the other methods until it heals.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the treatment of scabies.
We have previously described the types of dropsy, how water accumulates, the symptoms of each type, and its treatment with medicines.  Only the serous type is treated with iron; the serous type alone is treated with iron, while the other types, the phlegmatic and the fleshy types, are not to be treated with it at all.
If you have treated this type of serous scabies with medicines and your treatment has not been successful, then examine whether the patient has become extremely weak or has another illness besides the scabies, such as...
If the patient has a cough, diarrhea, or similar symptoms, then do not treat it with iron, for that is dangerous.  If you see that the patient is strong, has no illness besides the scabies, and is not a child or an elder, then proceed as follows:  Place the patient standing before you. And a servant behind him should squeeze his belly with their hands, pushing the water downwards towards the pubic area.  Then take a pointed scalpel in this manner:
With two narrow sides, long and pointed, like a scalpel, but with a slight concavity so that it does not penetrate into the intestines during use and harm them. Then, consider whether the scabies originated from the intestines.
If the scabies originated from the intestines, the incision should be three finger-widths below the navel, aligned with the pubic bone.  If the scabies originated from a liver disease, the incision should be three finger-widths to the left of the navel.  If the scabies originated from a spleen disease, the incision should be three finger-widths to the right of the navel.
Also, the incision should not be on the side the patient intends to lie on, so that fluids do not flow to that weakened area.  Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument, and insert the instrument into the incision, and raise your hand.
With the scalpel, separate the skin from the peritoneum, as if you were peeling it, to the extent of a fingernail or similar. Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches a hollow space, the location of the fluid.  Then extract the fluid and insert the instrument, which has this shape, into the hole.
It is like a tube made of thin brass or copper or smooth polished leather, with a small hole at the bottom and three holes on the sides; two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And its tip might have a probe on it, like a pen, in this shape.
At its upper end is a ring.  When the instrument reaches the fluid, it will drain from it onto the instrument.  Drain an average amount of fluid, because if you drain more than necessary at once, the patient might die from a collapse of their vital spirit.
Or he might experience a near-death faint.  However, drain it according to his strength and what the patient's pulse and complexion indicate. Then remove the instrument and retain the fluid, as it will have collected within it.
Because of the skin covering the hole in the diaphragm, which you were told to apply to it in that manner.  Then, return the instrument another day if you see the patient is able to tolerate it.
Also remove a small amount of fluid.  Do this for several days, while remaining watchful and avoiding errors so that only a little fluid remains.  If you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of fluid, then treat him with hot sand burial.
Excessive sweating in the bath and sun, and endurance of thirst, treat him with dried medications until he recovers. Cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the fluid as previously described.
Chapter fifty-five.
In the treatment of children born with unperforated or narrow, or misplaced, urinary openings.
Some boys may be born with an unperforated urethra, and it is necessary to perforate it as soon as possible after birth.
With a very thin scalpel, in this manner:.
Then insert a thin leaden nail into the opening and tie it, keeping it in place for three or four days. When urination occurs, remove it, and then replace it. If you do not use the lead, the urine passing through the area may cause it to close up.
As for those with a narrow opening, it is treated with lead, as we have mentioned, for many days until it widens.  And those whose opening is in the wrong place – some are born with the opening at the end of the urethra, and cannot urinate forward.
Until the urethra is lifted upwards by hand.  This is a serious condition because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line.  The method of treatment for this is for the patient to lie on their back.
Then stretch the urethra with your left hand, stretching it firmly, and trim the head of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel, like a penknife, or as if carving something so that its center protrudes like the urethra, and the opening falls in the center as it should.
Be careful during your procedure to avoid bleeding, as it often occurs.  Apply what stops the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-six.
Concerning the abscess that appears in the foreskin, the urethra, the blackness, the corruption, and the adhesion of the foreskin to the urethra.
This abscess often occurs in the urethra, a fleshy swelling, and can be malignant or benign.  The benign one should be lifted with a gentle hook.
And cut it completely to cleanse it, then apply a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment.  Afterwards, treat it with palm ointment until it heals.  However, if the abscess is malignant, dark in color, cauterization should be used after cutting and scraping it.
If the abscess is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and some of the abscess is inside the foreskin and some outside, the abscess from inside should be removed first.  Then, once it is closed, treat the external part.
Because if you treat both at the same time, you cannot be sure that the foreskin will not be pierced.  It can also occur in females, and in the foreskin, there will be blackness and corruption.  Therefore, all that has turned black and threatens to corrupt, or has already corrupted, should be excised.
Then apply honey, ground and sifted pomegranate rinds, and karsenna to the area.  Treat it with other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use a crescent-shaped cautery in this manner:
Cauterization is beneficial for both cases, namely bleeding and a corrupted wound. If the cauterized area is completely destroyed, a lead tube should be inserted into the urethra for the patient to urinate over it.  Regarding the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans...
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin was healthy and not circumcised, or it may result from a wound or tumor.  The foreskin should be scraped with a blunt scalpel until the ligament is loosened and the glans is separated from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them thoroughly, a small portion of the glans and foreskin should be scraped.  The foreskin is thin, and may tear quickly due to its thinness.  Then separate the foreskin and glans with a thin linen cloth that has been moistened in cool water, so that they do not stick together again.
Then treat with a styptic drink until it heals.
Chapter fifty-seven.
On the purification of boys and the treatment of their errors.
Circumcision is nothing other than separating a connection, like other surgeries. However, since it is something we do deliberately, and especially on children, it is necessary to outline the best course of action.
And the easiest path to safety, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is something we have acquired.
Through experience, I found that the majority of artisans and barbers used purification with knives, scissors, and cauterization with a thread, and cutting with a nail. I have tried all these methods.
So I found no better than purification with scissors and tying with thread, because purification with a knife often causes the skin to bleed, as the foreskin is two layers.  Perhaps the upper layer of skin is cut, but the lower layer remains.
This necessitates another cut and renewed pain. Purification by cauterization does not ensure that the tip of the urethra is not cut, as it might have entered its opening.  As for purification with a nail, perhaps the skin tears and your work is spoiled, or the boy's skin is naturally short.
Many are born this way and therefore do not need purification, and I have seen this.  However, purification with scissors and tying with thread, experience has revealed its superiority, because the scissors cut evenly, as the blade above is like the blade below.
When you squeeze your hand, the blades cut at the same level and in the same time, so the thread becomes like a wall to the skin of the urethra from all sides.  There is no mistake involved.  First, you should calm the boy.
Especially if he is somewhat intelligent, so that you tie the thread on his urethra only and leave it for another day, then make him happy and pleased in every way that you can, and what he accepts by his understanding.  Then, have him stand before you, erect.
Do not let him sit, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot.  Do not let the boy's eyes see them, or any instruments.  Then insert your hand into his urethra, blow on the skin, and lift it upward until the head of the urethra is exposed.
Then, clean it of any accumulated dirt.  Then tie the marked area with a doubled thread.  Then tie a second thread slightly below that.  Then hold the lower tie with your thumb and index finger firmly, and cut between the two ties. Then quickly lift the skin upwards, and expose the head of the urethra.  Then let the blood flow a little, as this is better and lessens the swelling of the urethra.  Then dry it with a damp cloth, and then sprinkle dried, burnt gourd ashes over it—this is the best I have tried, or the flour of the 'ḥawāri'—it is also excellent.
Then quickly lift the skin upwards, and expose the head of the urethra.  Then let the blood flow a little, as this is better and lessens the swelling of the urethra.  Then dry it with a damp cloth, and then sprinkle dried, burnt gourd ashes over it—this is the best I have tried, or the flour of the 'ḥawāri'—it is also excellent. Then apply a poultice made from a beaten hard-boiled egg in rosewater, mixed with soft, fragrant rose oil, to the wound through a folded cloth. Leave it on for a day. Then continue with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
This is the type of scissors suitable for purification.
The scissors should be straight, sharp, and nail-shaped. The blades should be the same length as the handles.  A mistake in the purification process might involve the inversion of the inserted skin, either completely or in part, during the cut.  Thus, one should extend it with a fingernail before the area swells.
Cut it [the skin] evenly. If you cannot hold it with a fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days pass and the area under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the inflammation subsides and gently dissect the skin.
Cut it as needed, being careful around the head of the urethra. If any part of the head of the urethra is cut, it will not harm; treat it using the poultices for wound healing described in the section on poultices.
If more skin is cut than necessary and it retracts upward, this is not very harmful either.  Treat it as previously mentioned until healed.
Chapter Fifty-eight.
On treating urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to blockage by a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or overgrown tissue, and similar causes.  If you treat this with the methods of treatment described in the classification, then [the condition] will be relieved.
If the urine has not passed and you suspect the retention is due to a stone harming the neck of the bladder, the patient should be placed on their knees, then another person should sit on their back, extending their stomach towards the back of the other person. The patient should hold themselves in place as much as possible.
This will then force the neck of the bladder to push the stone backward, allowing the urine to pass. If the urine does not pass using this method, and the patient's condition worsens, then the extraction of the stone with an instrument called a catheter, which has this form, should be used.
It is made of silver, thin and smooth, hollowed like a bird's feather tube, about a foot and a half long.  It has a gentle funnel at its head.  To draw out the urine, one should take a doubled thread and tie strong wool or cotton to one end.
The thread end is inserted into the lower end of the catheter, and any excess wool is trimmed with nippers so that it fits snugly into the tube, like a stopper.  Then the catheter is lubricated with oil, butter, or egg white. The patient is seated on a chair.
The patient's bladder and urethra are lubricated with moist ointments or warm water and oil. Then the catheter is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra, then the urethra is pulled upwards towards the navel, and the catheter is pushed further inside.
Once the urethra is pulled back, the catheter is pushed inside until it reaches near the rectum. The penis is then tilted downwards, with the catheter still inside, and pushed further until it reaches the bladder, where the patient feels it has reached an empty space.
This is done in this way because the passage for urine is curved.  If the thread with the wool is pulled slightly tight, the urine follows the wool.  Then it is removed, the urine is drained, and the catheter is withdrawn.
Continue doing this until the bladder is empty and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Images of suitable instruments for this purpose are made of silver or of hollow ivory.  They have a long, thin tube.  To instill water and medicines into it, a device called a syringe is used.  This is its image:.
Made of silver or hollow ivory, it has a long, thin tube; hollow throughout except for the end, which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
The hollow part where the projectile is placed should be just large enough to accommodate it, no more.  Thus, when pulled, any moisture will be drawn out, and when pushed, it will be propelled outward, just as a naval oil-throwing device works.
If you wish to remove moisture from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull upwards on the projectile.  The moisture will be drawn into the syringe, then the tip of the syringe will be inserted into the urethra as described for catheters, and the moisture will be expelled by pushing on the projectile.
This moisture will reach the bladder accordingly, so that the patient feels it.  This is also an image of a gentle enema, used to irrigate the bladder.
Made of silver or lead, its upper head resembles a small funnel, beneath which is a groove to hold the ligature.  Then, take a camel's bladder and place the moisture you wish to inject into the bladder within it.  Then, tie it tightly between the two grooves with a doubled thread.
Warm the moisture slightly over a fire, then insert the tip of the enema into the urethra.  Then, firmly press on the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels the moisture has reached the bladder.
If a bladder is not available, take a piece of parchment, make a circle from it, and pierce it all around.  Then, insert a strong thread through the holes as it circles, then gather the circle as a table is gathered, after placing the desired moisture, ointments, and water within it.
Then tie it to the instrument and use it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the removal of stones.
We have previously discussed the types of stones, their treatment with medicines, and the differences between kidney stones and bladder stones, along with their signs.  We also discussed stones requiring manual removal and incision.
This is especially the case with stones originating in the bladder, and those that form in the urethra, which I will describe clearly and concisely.
I say that bladder stones are most commonly found in children, and a sign is that the urine passes from the bladder like thin water.
Sand appears in the urine, the child rubs and plays with his genitals, often the penis hangs down, and the anus often protrudes in many of them.  Children recover easily from this up to the age of fourteen, while it is more difficult in the elderly; and in young adults it is intermediate between these two.
Those with larger stones have easier treatment, the opposite being true for smaller stones.  Thus, when proceeding to treatment, the patient should first be given an enema to remove all waste from their bowels, as it may obstruct the view of the stone.
Then the patient's legs are held and shaken downwards to bring the stone to the neck of the bladder, or the patient is made to jump from a height several times.  Then, the patient is seated upright with hands under the thighs, so that the entire bladder tilts downwards, and then examined.
And feel for it from the outside.  If you feel the stone in the space, immediately make a cut on it. If it is not at all within reach, then the index finger should be smeared with grease from the left hand, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger.
If the boy is fully developed, insert it into his anus, search for the stone.  Once it is under your finger, move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the location you intend to cut.
Tell one servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and another to extend his right hand upwards towards the vulva, and with his other hand to pull the skin below the vulva towards the location of the incision.  Then take the probe, which has this shape:
Make the incision between the anus and vulva, not in the middle, but towards the left flank. The incision should be directly on the stone. Your finger should be in the anus and you should press it outwards, angled so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, as much as possible, to allow the stone to exit.
Do not exert too much pressure, as you might push the stone out of the anus during the incision, causing no difficulty.  Know that some stones may have sharp angles and edges, making removal difficult.
Some stones are smooth, like a chestnut, and round, making removal easy. If a stone has angles and edges, widen the incision slightly. If it still does not come out, you should devise a strategy; either grasp it with a firm forceps, the tip of which is like a file.
To grip the stone firmly and prevent it from escaping.  Or, insert a gentle, curved instrument under it. If these methods fail, widen the incision slightly. If significant bleeding occurs, stop it with a cautery.
If there is more than one stone, first push the largest one into the bladder opening, then incise around it.  Push the smaller stones out afterwards. Do the same if there are more than two stones.  If the stone is very large, it is foolish to make a large incision, as it may put the patient at risk for one of two outcomes.
Either he will die or he will have constant urinary leakage, because the area will not heal properly.  However, try to push it out, or devise a method to break it with forceps so that it can be removed in pieces.
After completing the procedure, treat the wound with kandar, sabr, sheyan, and bandages. Place a wet cloth soaked in oil, a drink, rose ointment, or cool water over it to soothe the inflamed area.  Then, the patient should lie on their back, and the dressings should not be changed until the third day.
Once the swelling subsides, wash the area thoroughly with water and oil, then treat it with the date palm ointment and the basilisk ointment until it heals. If excessive heat, inflammation, or swelling develops, such as blood clotting in the bladder that obstructs urination (recognizable by the presence of blood in the urine),...
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to the corruption and infection of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of complication with a corresponding remedy until it heals.
Throughout the treatment, the thighs should be bound together to hold the medications applied to the affected area in place. If the stone is small and lodged in the urethra, causing inflammation and blockage of urination, treat it using the methods I previously described before it leads to rupture.
Often, this treatment obviates the need for incision.  I have used this method, which involves taking a surgical instrument of tempered steel, shaped as follows:
A triangular, pointed, sharpened instrument is affixed to a handle.  Then, a thread is used to tie the penis below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder.  The instrument is then gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the instrument on the stone slowly, attempting to pierce it until it passes through to the other side.  Urine will flow immediately.  Then, press with your hand on the remaining stone outside the penis; it will break into pieces and be expelled with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not possible due to an obstruction, tie a thread below the stone and another above the stone.  Then, incise the stone on the penis itself between the ties, and remove it.
Then, untie the threads and clean the coagulated blood in the wound.  The thread was tied below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other above it so that when the thread is untied after the stone is removed, the skin will return to its place and cover the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns and covers the wound, as we said.
Chapter Sixty-One.
On removing stones in women.
Stones rarely develop in women. If one of them suffers from a stone, treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin, and another is that you cannot find a woman who permits herself to the physician.
If she is chaste or from among those with close relatives, and thirdly, you do not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially manual work. Fourthly, the incision site on the stone in women is far from the location of the stone, so a deeper incision is needed.
And there is danger in this.  If necessity demands it, a skilled female physician should be sought, but this is rare. If not found, seek a virtuous and compassionate male physician, or bring a skilled midwife knowledgeable in women's matters, or a woman somewhat knowledgeable in this craft.
She should be brought in and instructed to perform all the examinations for the stone, first.  If the woman is a virgin, the finger should be inserted into her vagina to search for the stone. If found, it should be pressed against the finger.
Then instruct her to make an incision on it.  If the woman is not a virgin but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it firmly.
If found, it should be guided from the opening of the bladder downwards to the extent of its reach, until it reaches the root of the thigh. Then, an incision should be made on it at the midpoint of the vagina, near the root of the thigh, from whichever direction she feels the stone is located in that area.
And her finger should not leave the stone, pressing on it.  The incision should be small at first, then the instrument should be inserted into that small incision. If she feels the stone, she should increase the incision to the extent she knows the stone will come out.  Know that the types of stones are numerous.
Among them are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and those with branches. Recognize their types so you can determine what you want. If blood flows profusely, sprinkle powdered alum on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out. Prepare the instruments mentioned for removing stones in men to assist in your work.  If you encounter excessive bleeding and know the bleeding is from a severed artery, apply styptics to the area.
Tighten the styptic firmly and leave it. Do not reapply it. Leave the stone; do not remove it.  Perhaps the patient will perish. Then treat the wound.  If the severity of the bleeding subsides after several days and the area becomes infected, return to your work until the stone is expelled.
Chapter Sixty-two.
On the incision of hydroceles.
A hydrocele is an accumulation of moisture in the whitish peritoneum beneath the skin of the testicle, which surrounds the testicle, and is called the scrotum. It may also be in a special membrane prepared by nature in one part of the testicle.
So that one might think it another testicle, and it lies between the scrotum and the whitish peritoneum, which we mentioned. This only happens rarely.  This hydrocele arises from weakness in the females, causing this substance to accumulate.  It may also result from a blow to the females.
This moisture can have various colors; it may be yellowish, or bloody red, or dark blackish-red, or white watery, which is most common.  The signs by which it is recognized are...
Where the water accumulates, if it is in the whitish peritoneum that we mentioned, the swelling will be somewhat oval, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle will not be visible because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a membrane specific to it, the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle.
For this reason, a person might imagine it to be another testicle. If the moisture is between the scrotum and the white peritoneum, it can be felt.  If you wish to ascertain the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe, whose image we previously presented; you judge its contents by what comes out after the probe.
If we move to treatment with leeches, the patient should be bled from a vein if possible, and if you see their body is full, then they should lie on their back on a slightly elevated surface, with many cloths placed underneath, and you sit on their left side.
And instruct a servant to sit on his right side, extending his penis to one side of the scrotum, towards the flank of the abdomen.  Then, take a broad scalpel and cut the scrotum lengthwise, from the center, towards the pubis.
The incision should be straight, parallel to the line dividing the scrotum in half, until it reaches the white peritoneum, which you will separate from it; be careful not to cut it.  Your dissection should primarily be on the side closest to the testicle, and you should continue as much as you are able.
Then, widely spread the water-filled peritoneum and remove all the water; then, separate the edges of the incision with forceps, and pull the peritoneum upwards, without touching the scrotum, and cut the peritoneum as much as you can, either all at once or piece by piece.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not completely cut it, you cannot be sure that the water will not return.  If the testicle protrudes outside its covering while you are working, then, when you have finished cutting the peritoneum, return it to its place and then stitch together the edges of the scrotum.
Then treat it as you would any other surgical wound until it heals. If the testicle is already damaged by another disease, you should tie off the vessels in the sac to prevent bleeding, then cut the testicle from the sac and remove the testicle, and then treat it as described above.
If the accumulated water is on both sides, know that they are hydroceles.  Incise the other side in the same manner as you did the first, and if it is simpler for you to do a single operation, do so. Then wipe away the blood.
Insert wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions.  Place another layer of wool soaked in a mixture of syrup and oil over the scrotum and the abdominal region.  Put a folded cloth, the `rafā'id`, on top. Bind it from above with the six-sided bandage in this manner:.
Then, take two cloths, stitch them together, and fill them with fluffy wool, like this example.  Make the straps that bind them from damp cotton or wool, and tighten them with a belt around the waist. One strap should run from the buttocks to the back.
The second strap runs towards the pubic area, and the other two straps run down the thighs, below the knees. The remaining two straps run on the groins.  All the straps are fastened together around the waist belt.  This hydrocele can also be treated with cautery instead of incision with an iron.
This involves taking a gentle, heated, knife-like cautery iron and cutting the scrotum's skin until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed.  Take another cautery iron in this manner:.
It resembles a Greek eye. Then, using that heated iron, cauterize the peritoneum until all the moisture is removed.  Then, grasp the peritoneum with forceps and use the cautery iron to scrape off and cut the containing layer as much as possible, until all are removed, while protecting the testicle from the fire.
Know that this method is safer and avoids blood loss, and better than incision.  If during the incision or cautery, a hot swelling or bleeding occurs, or anything else, you should treat it using the appropriate treatments mentioned earlier.
If the patient is timid and cannot endure this procedure because of its unpleasantness, then use the cauterization method as I described, if it is acceptable to you, based on the previous explanations.
If the fluid is watery, the patient should sit on a raised chair.  Then, cauterize the swelling below it with a wide scalpel.  Maintain the cauterization along the body, ensuring a wide opening to allow all water to drain.  Then apply cotton to the area and bind it.
Allow the remaining water to drain. Then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not drain during cauterization, it is likely due to the white membrane obstructing the wound opening, preventing drainage.
In that case, you should insert a goose feather, or the instrument used to remove fluid from abscesses, whose image was previously shown, or slightly enlarge the wound opening.
Know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so.  If it does, cauterize it again in the same manner, and the patient should observe their days accordingly.
Chapter Sixty-three.
On the incision of fleshy sores and their treatment.
Know that incision of these sores is often a perilous undertaking, leading to death in most cases.  Therefore, we recommend leaving them alone and avoiding such a procedure.  I will now discuss the treatment and the various types of tumors.
I say that many tumors may arise in the body, particularly in the feminine organs, for many reasons.  This may result either from a sharp fluid buildup in the organs, or from injury.  The color of the tumor will be similar to the skin, and there is no water associated with it.
The tumor will be hard, and perhaps stony, dark in color, and without sensation.  It may be due to the entanglement and swelling of arteries, as mentioned previously, or the swelling of veins.  When due to arterial swelling, its nature can be identified by the spreading of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, it will not spread.  One should never attempt surgery on it.  If it is from swelling of the veins, nothing will spread when pressed by fingers.  This type can be incised, as can other flesh.
You should incise the scrotum, then elevate the testicle and remove it from the white peritoneum.  Free the spermatic cord from the vessels, tie the vessels, and cut the cord after freeing it from all sides of the testicle.  If the testicle has adhered to the growing tissue.
Then the testicle must be removed and cut.  If the adhesion is between any of the peritonea or among the vessels, then all such adhesion must be freed and cut in a circular fashion.
If the tissue growth is in the area of adhesion, which is located behind, then all of it must be cut and the testicle removed, as we said.  Once completed, treat the wound with wet wool in rose oil and drink, and then treat it with further remedies until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
On treating the dropsy with dropsy.
Dropsy is a swollen, somewhat twisted tumor, resembling a cluster, with relaxation of the limbs, and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking. In treating this ailment, the remedies are similar to those previously mentioned.
However, it is necessary to note the practice of the ancients in this matter.  I say that the patient should sit on a raised chair, then the lower limbs should be pulled downwards, and the scrotum grasped with your fingers, along with the vessels close to the penis.
A servant of yours should hold it, pulling it firmly, then, with a broad, sharp scalpel, make an oblique incision near the vessels until the vessels are exposed.  Then, dissect from every side, as I previously described in dissecting the arteries in the temples, and insert a needle with a doubled thread.
Tie it at the initial points where the dropsy appeared and also at its end, then make a lengthwise incision in the middle, perpendicular to the body, and remove the accumulated foul and corrupt moisture.
Then treat the wound with the treatment for other wounds that require a period for healing, to allow the vessels that nourish one limb to recede.  This is permissible. If the dropsy affects all the vessels, then one of the limbs must be removed along with the vessels so that the testicle does not lack nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, it will wither and be of no use.
Chapter Sixty-five.
On the treatment of intestinal dropsy.
This dropsy occurs when a rupture appears in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen, near the groin, causing the intestines to protrude into one of the limbs.
This hernia is either from a rupture in the peritoneum or from its extension.  These two types arise from many causes, such as a blow, a jump, a cry, or lifting something heavy, and so on.  If it is from the extension of the peritoneum, the hernia develops gradually over a long time.
It does not appear suddenly.  If it is from the peritoneum's extension, the swelling is gradual and deep, because the peritoneum compresses the intestines.  If it is from a rupture in the peritoneum, it initially causes intense pain all at once, and the swelling is noticeable under the skin nearby.
This is because the intestines protrude and exit the peritoneum.  Along with the intestines, fluid may also exit, and this dropsy is then called intestinal and fluid-filled.  It may also be accompanied by gas.  The intestines may also collect waste matter, which becomes stagnant and leads to the patient's demise.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially if compressed.  Treating these types of ailments with iron is dangerous, so one should avoid this.  The procedure is to instruct the patient to push the intestines back into their abdomen by hand if they can be returned.
Then, the patient lies on their back with you in front of them, and their legs are raised.  Next, the skin near the groin is pulled upward, and the entire scrotal skin is incised lengthwise.  Hooks are then inserted into the edges of the incision to a degree that is necessary to open the incision.
The incision should be as large as possible to allow the testicle to protrude.  Then, the peritoneum under the scrotal skin is peeled back until the tough, white peritoneum is exposed on all sides.  At this point, insert your index finger underneath the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum under the testicle's skin and the second peritoneum, detach the adhesions behind the testicle.  Then, with your right hand, pull inward on the scrotal skin.  At the same time, pull the white peritoneum upward with your left hand, lifting the testicle and peritoneum towards the incision.
You instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upward.  You completely detach the adhesions behind it.  Use your finger to check for any twisted intestines within the tough white peritoneum.  If you find any, push them back into the abdomen below.
Then, take a needle with a thick thread, twisted from ten strands, and insert it at the edge of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin near the incision.  Then cut the ends of the thread so that there are four strands remaining. Then, interlace some of the strands and tie them tightly around the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin on both sides.  Then wrap and tie the ends of the threads tightly, so that nothing from the supplying vessels can reach it. To prevent a hot swelling from forming.  There should also be a second ligature, outside the first, a distance of less than two fingers.  After these two ligatures, leave a portion of peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a finger's breadth.
To prevent a hot swelling from forming.  There should also be a second ligature, outside the first, a distance of less than two fingers.  After these two ligatures, leave a portion of peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a finger's breadth. Cut the rest completely around and remove the testicle.  Then cut a slit in the lower scrotal skin, one that bleeds and oozes as described previously.  Then use wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound, and apply the ligature that we have described.
The white peritoneum, after it has been cut, may be cauterized, to prevent bleeding, as this often occurs.  Leave the ligature until it falls off of its own accord.  If it is slow to fall off, then soak it in hot water and apply something to make it sweat so that it will fall off.
Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for surgical wounds until healed.
Sixty-sixth Chapter.
In this type of spasmodic colic, I have seen no one dare to treat it with iron.  The ancients stated that one should proceed as described for the colic with a gallstone, namely to tie off the vessels gently after slitting them lower down.
Then slit it in the middle and treat the swelling in a way that opens it up, so the vessels fall away. Treat the wound as previously described until it heals.
Seventieth Chapter.
In the hernia that occurs in the groin.
The hernia in the groin may present, as we said, without the contents of the intestines descending into the scrotum; if they do descend, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if it persists for a long time, the opening in the peritoneum will increase, so that the intestines and the testicles descend into the scrotum.  This occurs from the extension of the peritoneum that is in the groin, as we said. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and protrudes the area, and its treatment is by cauterization, as its description was previously given.
And it may be treated with iron in this manner: the patient lies on their back before you, and then you make a transverse incision in the swollen, protruding hernia, about the width of three fingers, and then dissect the peritoneums beneath the skin.
Until the white peritoneum beneath is exposed, then you take a suture, place it on the protruding portion of the peritoneum, and press it down into the abdomen.  Then sew the two protruding portions of the peritoneum together at the suture's end, attaching one to the other with the stitches.
Then pull out the suture, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I instructed you in the treatment of intestinal obstructions. Then treat it as in the treatment of other surgical cases.
When the threads are cut, clean and close the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the hernia protrusion will not increase.
And this method is the best in this case, because it is closest to safety.
Chapter Sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the scrotum.
The scrotum often relaxes in some people without the flesh within relaxing, making it unsightly.  Therefore, whoever wishes to treat this should lay the patient on their back.
Cut all the relaxed skin from the thick skin, then bring the lips together. If you wish, first stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, secure the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter Sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
For this reason, I should not have mentioned it in this book, but I did so for two reasons: one, so that a physician, when asked, will know about it, and may know how to treat anyone affected; the other, that we often need to castrate some animals for our own benefit.
Like sheep, oxen, cats, and similar animals, I say that castration is done in two ways, either by crushing or by cutting and incision.  The method of crushing involves placing the animal in hot water until its testicles relax and soften, and hang down.
Then you crush them with your hand until they break apart and are no longer discernible to the touch.  As for castration by incision and cutting, the animal should be held, and the skin of its testicles squeezed with the left hand, then the scrotum tied, and a single incision made on each testicle.
Until the testicles are exposed, then cut them after peeling them and leave nothing of the membranes except the thin membrane covering the vessels.  This method of castration is better than that done by crushing.
Because crushing may leave some of the testicles, and the animal will desire mating, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the treatment of hermaphrodites.
Hermaphrodites in men are of two types. One appears as a space, or on the scrotum between the testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva with hair. Urine may flow from what is in the scrotum.
As for women, there is one type, appearing above the vulva on the pubic bone, like small, protruding man's testicles. One of them resembles a man's penis, and both resemble women's. The treatment for all three types.
The two types of men and the one type of women, the excess flesh must be cut off, so that the effect is removed, and then treated with the treatment of other wounds, until it heals. As for the second type of men from whom urine flows from the scrotum, there is no need for treatment, nor is it possible to cure it at all.
Chapter seventy-one.
On the cutting of the clitoris and the protruding flesh from women's vulvas.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond the natural amount, becoming unsightly and deformed.  In some women, it may enlarge to the extent of resembling that of men, interfering with intercourse.
Therefore, one should grasp the excess clitoris with one's hand or forceps and cut it off.  Do not cut deeply, especially not into the root, to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical remedies until it heals.  As for the protruding flesh, it is flesh that grows in the vaginal opening, filling it up.
And sometimes it extends outwards, resembling a tail. Therefore, some ancient practitioners called this "the tail-like disease."  It should be cut off, just as the clitoris, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-two.
On the treatment of prolapse.
Prolapse is when a woman's vagina is not perforated or has a small perforation, either natural from birth or accidental.  The accidental case results from a prior condition, which can be from excess growing flesh.
Or thin or thick peritoneum, and it may be in the depth of the uterus, or on its sides, or at the top or bottom. It prevents intercourse, procreation, and childbirth, and may prevent menstruation.  This is recognized by the midwife's examination.
If the obstruction is visible and close, if not visible, then she should examine it with her fingers or with a probe. If the obstruction is from thin peritoneum and close to the labia, then quickly make an incision.  This is done by creating a slight depression on the labia, then placing both thumbs on them.
The woman should be on her back with legs spread, then forcefully spread the labia until the thin peritoneum is pierced and the obstruction opens.  Then she should take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area.  The woman should have intercourse each day so that the area does not re-adhere.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, it should be cut with a wide scalpel resembling a thin leaf. If the obstruction is from excess tissue, it should be suspended with forceps and cut.  Have on hand hemostatic medicines, such as qaqia, shiyan, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then a wide lead tube should be used to prevent the wound from closing quickly. Hold it for several days, and use a dry linen thread. Then treat the wound like other abscesses until it heals.  Further growths of tissue may appear in the uterus, which should be treated in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, a cancerous tumor in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that appear in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the veins' mouths, causing frequent and copious bleeding. If hemorrhoids progress, they become warts.  Their types and signs were previously mentioned in the classification, and are noted here.
The treatable and untreatable types are as follows: Hemorrhoids and warts deep within the uterus, not visible to touch, have no treatment with iron.  Those on the uterine opening, noticeable to touch, are treatable.
The woman should enter a cool room, then use a lancet or a rough cloth to scrape off the warts at their roots.  Then, if bleeding from a vessel occurs, apply a cauterizing agent that stops the bleeding without causing further injury.
For example, qaqia, shiyan, and frankincense, and similar substances. Then, raise her legs up against the wall for an hour, then lower them into cool water. If the bleeding continues, seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, and tamarisk, etc.  Then, take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
Apply this to her back. If the bleeding stops, then discontinue. Otherwise, continue with cupping to the back, breasts and sternum, without restriction.  Then, take wool and dip it into the juice of thorns, or the juice of goat's rue, or the juice of elm twigs, along with tamarisk drink, and apply it to the affected area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until healed. As for a red sore, resembling the heads of boils, rough in appearance, it should be cut away as described for warts, and treated until healed.
Chapter Seventy-four.
On the treatment of a tumor in the womb.
Many types of tumors may appear in the womb, such as cancer, hard tumors, ulcers, wasting diseases, devouring diseases, warts, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors. All these diseases and their types and signs have been described in the classification.
Therefore, in this chapter, we must describe the hot tumor in the womb, if it is one of the tumors that accumulate over time.  How should it be treated with iron? One should consider if the initial pain of the tumor is sharp, accompanied by throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
And if you see it red, if touched, do not rush to treat it with iron. Treat it with what aids ripening until these symptoms subside.  Then, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean back on it.
And bring her legs together towards the lower abdomen, with her thighs spread apart, and position her arms under her knees, securing them with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument that opens the cervix, a depiction of which will follow.  When using this instrument, one must estimate the depth of the woman's uterus to prevent the instrument from penetrating deeper than the uterus.
For if the instrument is too deep, it will harm the patient.  Therefore, pads should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the uterine depth. The spiral that runs along the instrument should be positioned on the upper side.
While you hold the instrument, the attendant turns the spiral to open the cervix. If a swelling appears, is soft and thin when touched by hand, it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel. If all the matter is discharged.
A soft wick soaked in rose oil or a green oil with some astringent should be placed in the wound.  The wick should protrude from the incision in the cervix.  Clean wool soaked in boiled bread-maker's water should be placed externally, on the uterus and pubis.
Then, it should be treated two days later with the appropriate ointment until healed.
The uterus and wound can be washed by injecting water and honey, then water in which the root of the wormwood or long zeraoun has been boiled.  Then, return to the ointment, if the swelling is hidden inside the uterus.
Iron should not be used for treatment, rather it should be treated as described in the division.
Chapter Seventy-five.
On teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses that emerge in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the natural form of childbirth.  Signs include: if the woman swells downwards, desires to smell the air, and finds her postpartum condition less burdensome.
And if the delivery of the fetus is rapid, know that this birth is natural, and the fetus emerges headfirst, with the placenta either with it or hanging from its navel.  If you see these signs, you should massage her abdomen to hasten the delivery of the fetus.
If it descends headfirst, the placenta descends with it and is cleaned thoroughly of impurities.  Any birth other than this is unnatural and undesirable, as the fetus may emerge feet first, or with arms or feet emerging before the head.
And one arm or one leg, or its head and an arm, or it emerges folded, or perhaps turned upside down, and similar undesirable forms.  The midwife must be skillful and gentle with all these things, and must be wary of mistakes and errors.
And I am explaining each form and how to handle it, so you will recognize it and understand it. If the fetus emerges headfirst, the natural way, and it is difficult for the woman and the delivery is slow, and you see her strength weakening, have her sit on a chair and order women to restrain her.
And bind her uterus with cooked henna and moist ointments. Then the midwife should insert a small scalpel between her fingers and cut the placenta, or cut it with her fingernail, until the moisture within it flows out.  Massage the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, the woman should be injected with henna juice mixed with shiraj oil.  Then, after the injection, instruct her to cough and make her sneeze with the kunds [a type of instrument]. Hold her mouth and nose. The fetus will emerge shortly. If the fetus's arms emerge first, gently return them, little by little.
If entry is not possible, place the woman on a platform, raising her legs high, then shake the platform on the ground.  The woman should hold on to prevent falling during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus is dead, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them out gently; he will come out.  If the fetus emerges on its feet, push the feet upward, then turn the fetus slowly until it is straight.  Then take one foot and gently pull it out slowly.
If they emerge to the thighs, instruct her to cough and sneeze her with the kunds; it will come out. If it does not come out as described, gently return the fetus little by little until it is in its natural position; it will then emerge smoothly.  If it resists all of the described methods...
Take henna juice, fenugreek juice, shiraj oil, and dissolved gum. Grind them well in a mortar. Then, apply this mixture to the woman's vulva and lower abdomen.  Then, have her sit in lukewarm water until the [fetus's] extremities appear.
If you see that it has softened underneath, make her a pessary of myrrh and have her endure it.  If she has held the pessary for an hour, then have her sit on a chair, then sneeze her, close her mouth and nose, and gently press on her lower abdomen. The fetus will then come out immediately.  The fetus emerges on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, gently insert your hands little by little.  Then, the woman should lie on her back, her legs dangling downwards, lying on a bed, and holding her hands. Then, gently press on her upper abdomen. Then remove the cushions from under her legs so that they are elevated. If the fetus does not emerge, grab both of her legs and move them vigorously. Then, press gently on top of the extremities, little by little, until the fetus rises.  Then, the midwife should insert her hand and gently reposition the fetus.
Tell the woman to strain until the fetus emerges. The fetus emerges, sideways, with one arm hanging down. Gently attempt to reposition its arm. If unable to reposition it, place the woman upright and have her walk.  If she cannot walk, have her lie down.
Shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice, as described, made from saliva. If the delivery is imminent, have her sit on a chair, then reposition the arm and straighten the fetus. Have the woman sneeze and instruct her to strain until it emerges.
The fetus emerges on its back, arms outstretched, face towards the mother's back. The midwife should grasp the fetus's arm and gently turn and straighten it. Once straightened, apply the grease and saliva poultices as previously described.
Then instruct her to move slowly. When she does, have her sit on a chair and instruct her to lean to the right side. Then tell her to strain and have her sneeze with the cupping instrument, and it will emerge. The fetus will emerge upright on its side.
If the fetus and placenta descend in this manner, cut the placenta with your fingernail to remove moisture. If the placenta adheres to the fetus's face or neck, cut it from the umbilical cord to prevent suffocation and death.  Then push the fetus inwards until it is in the proper position.
Instruct the woman to strain repeatedly, as this will facilitate easy delivery.  For the delivery of twins or multiple fetuses, know that twins frequently are born, and sometimes three or four are born and survive.  However, this is rare.  Five fetuses is unnatural and will never survive.
And they (multiple fetuses) are surrounded by one placenta, even if numerous, and are separated by a membranous partition connecting to the umbilical cord of each.  They may emerge like a single fetus, in a natural and easy way. They also may emerge in a difficult manner, as described.
If any of them (the fetuses) encounter difficulty during delivery and become as we described in the unnatural forms, treat them as we have described.  Let the midwife be gentle, acting with care and patience, and apply any method available to her that leads to safety.
It is conceivable that one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten fetuses may form in the uterus, and it has been observed that one woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all conceived.
By the knowledge of the All-Knowing, All-Merciful, this should all be within the knowledge of the midwife, as she may encounter such a case someday and respond appropriately.
Chapter Sixty-seven.
In the removal of the dead fetus.
If, after treating the dead fetus with the methods of treatment described in the classification, it does not emerge, and you are forced to use manual intervention, you should observe. If the woman is strong and has no symptoms that cause concern for injury, the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
Her head should be tilted downward and her legs raised, and an attendant should hold her on both sides or tie her to the bed so that her body does not shift when the fetus is being delivered.
Then, moisten the mouth of her uterus with the moist ointments, along with the saliva of the *khatimi*, fenugreek, and flaxseed.  Then, the midwife anoints her hand with these ointments and saliva, and gently inserts it into the uterus. Then, she seeks a place to insert the hooks, appropriate for the fetus, and the locations suitable for this.
See, if the fetus is positioned to descend head-first, insert the hooks into its eyes, or nape, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or collarbone, or in the areas near the ribs, or under the clavicles.
And if it descends feet-first, then in the pubic area and the middle ribs.  The hook should be held in the right hand, its curvature positioned between the fingers of the left hand, and the hand should be inserted gently and the hook placed in one of those mentioned locations.
Until it reaches an empty space, then insert another hook, or a third if needed, so that the pulling is equal and does not tilt to one side.  Then, pull evenly, and the pull should not be straight, but moved in every direction.
To facilitate its exit, as is done with a tooth during extraction.  During this process, the pulling should be relaxed if it becomes obstructed in a direction. The midwife should anoint some fingers with ointment and insert them to rotate what is obstructed. If some part of the fetus comes out, move the hooks to other locations.
She should do this a little higher until the entire fetus is expelled. If a hand emerges before the rest and cannot be returned due to compression, it should be wrapped in a cloth and pulled out until, when it is all out, it is severed.
Either at the wrist joint or the elbow.  The same should be done for the other hand and the legs. If the fetal head is large and has difficulty exiting due to pressure, or if there is accumulated water in the head, a sharp-pointed instrument should be inserted between the fingers.
Using it, the head is fractured to allow the water to drain, or it is fractured with the instrument called a *mashdakh*, the image of which appears with the images of other instruments in the following chapter.
Likewise, if the fetus has a large head, the skull should be fractured or crushed with the *mashdakh*, as we have said.  Then the bones are extracted with forceps.  If the head comes out and is obstructed at the collarbone, it should be fractured to allow the moisture in the chest to drain.
Then the chest will adhere. If the chest does not adhere and cannot be expelled, cut as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or contains lumps, it should be incised to allow the moisture to drain.
If the fetus is on its feet, pulling it out and guiding it to the opening of the uterus is easy.  If it is obstructed at the abdomen or chest, then it should be pulled with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be incised to allow what is inside to drain.
If all the other parts have been removed and the head retracts and is trapped, let the midwife insert her left hand. If the cervix is open, the hand should be inserted into the neck of the uterus, to locate the head and pull it with the fingers toward the opening of the uterus.  Then a hook or two hooks should be inserted and used to pull it out.
If the cervix has adhered to a hot, inflamed tumor, it should not be forcefully treated.  Instead, use applications of oily, moist substances, and use bandages.  Sit in relaxing, moist water.
If the fetus is on its side, if it can be straightened, use what we described for a live fetus. If this is not possible, it should be cut and removed.  Absolutely nothing of the placenta should be left inside.  When you have finished your treatment, use the treatments we described for hot tumors that occur in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, she should descend into constricting water, and use other treatments. I have witnessed a woman who became pregnant, and then the fetus died inside her, and later she became pregnant again.
Then the other fetus also died. After a long time, a tumor appeared in her womb, swelling until it opened and began discharging pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal.  I then applied some strong, drawing ointments to it.
A bone then emerged from the area, and after several days, another bone came out. I was amazed by this, as the abdomen is a location without bones. I reasoned that these were bones from the deceased fetus. I examined the wound and removed many bones from the fetal skull.
I continued this process until I removed many bones, and the woman was in the best of health.  She lived like that for a long time, with a little pus emanating from the area.  I have presented this unusual case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts to achieve with his hands in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-seven.
It contains images of the instruments needed for removing the fetus.
Image of a spiral for opening the cervix.
This binder with which books are bound has two spirals at the ends of the wooden boards, but this spiral should be finer than the binder and should be either of ebony or of acacia wood.  The width of each board should be the thickness of two fingers.
Their edges are about a finger's width, and their length is one and a half spans. In the middle of the boards are two pegs made of the same wood, fastened into them; their length is half a span or a little more, and their width is about two fingers or a little more.  These two pegs.
They are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you turn the spirals; an image of another instrument for this purpose, finer and lighter.
It is made of ebony or acacia wood in the shape of forceps, but has two pegs at its end, as you see. The length of each peg is about a span, and their width is two fingers.  If you want to open the cervix with it...
So, place the woman on a bed with her legs spread apart between her thighs. Then, insert these two pegs, together, into the mouth of the cervix, while holding the end of the instrument between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument as you would with forceps, as far as you want to open the cervix. So that the midwife can do what she wants.  Image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument used to deliver the fetus.
Image of the instrument used to crush the fetal head.
It resembles scissors, with teeth at the end, as you see.  It can be made rectangular like forceps, with saw-like teeth for cutting and tearing, as you see.
Image of another instrument.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so it doesn't break when pulling the fetus, image of a two-pronged hook.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more diverse their types and readily available from the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his reputation amongst people.  Therefore, do not disdain any instrument, having it prepared for you, for you may need it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In removing the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the woman to hold herself, then make her sneeze with a spoon and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils.  If it comes out this way, do so. Otherwise, take a measure.
Pierce a hole in the cover, and place in it herbs that open the cervix, such as fennel, rue, dill, chamomile, wormwood, and licorice, or some of these medicines. Soak them in water and put it over heat. Then place a silver tube over the hole in the lid, and the other end in the woman's cervix.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then make her sneeze, as we said.  If the placenta comes out quickly. If it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in butter of a certain herb or the saliva of the spiny lizard.
Then, she enters it into the vagina and searches for the placenta. If she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out slowly, little by little. If it is stuck deep within the womb, insert the hand as we described. Once the placenta is located, gently pull it out slowly.
So that the uterus does not fall when pulled too hard, rather, it should be gently moved to the sides, right and left. Then the amount of pulling should be increased.  Then it will yield and be freed from the adhesion. If the cervix is closed, we have described the treatment with sneezing, the treatment with the pot, and the herbs.
If it does not come out with all the methods described, avoid any force in pulling it again.  Instead, tie what has come out to the woman's thigh. Then inject her with the four-component ointment; it will cause it to fester after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out.  However, if it festers, a foul odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, causing pain to the patient. Therefore, a suitable fumigation should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients have tried the smoke of the cypress and dried figs, a depiction of the apparatus used to fumigate the woman in cases of delayed menses, placenta retention, and similar conditions.
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or made of copper. The thin end is placed at the vulva, and the wide end over the fire. The incense is placed on the embers and held until the incense is gone, then more is added.
Chapter Seventy-nine.
In the treatment of the unperforated anus.
Many boys are born with unperforated anuses, blocked by a thin membrane.  The midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger, or failing that, pierce it with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to touch the muscle.
Then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, and treat with ointments until healed.  If you fear it will close again, place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
The anus may also be blocked by a scar or tumor.  In such a case, the scar/tumor should be incised, then treated with the remedies mentioned above and with cauterization.
Chapter Eighty.
On treating corns that occur on the soles.
Corns that occur on the soles are a thickening and hardening that occurs near the anus, either externally or in a space on one side. There may be one or more corns.
If this thickening persists, it may open and discharge a white watery fluid or thin pus.  Some of these corns may penetrate the rectum and intestines.  If non-penetrating, they are not noticeable.  Penetrating corns can be identified by the stool and wind that is discharged when using a stool softener.
And perhaps worms may be expelled from them.  Some corns, if in the space, may penetrate the bladder and urethra.  Others may penetrate the hip joint and tailbone.  A corn that penetrates the anus can also be distinguished from one that does not.
Insert your index finger into the anus and introduce a thin probe of copper or iron into the corn. If the corn is not curved, if it is curved, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair in your finger. If you feel nothing at all, and no stool, wind, or worms emerge from the opening, as we have stated, know that it is not penetrating, and proceed with treatment.
If the fistula penetrates the bladder or urethra, the sign is the discharge of urine from it and the failure of the affected area to heal with medication.  If it penetrates the hip joint or tailbone, the sign is the probe reaching that location.
If there is no curvature toward the bone, and pain is localized to a side, and pus constantly emerges, and treatment is ineffective and does not heal with ointment, then these penetrating fistulas have no cure.
Treating these is a futile effort for those ignorant physicians who attempt it.  However, for non-penetrating, non-chronic fistulas, healing is expected by cauterization, as I describe and have experienced.  The patient should be positioned supine.
Raise the patient's legs, and incline the thighs towards the abdomen. Then, insert a copper or lead probe into the fistula, if there is a curvature, so you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels the probe near the anus, you should then insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe has penetrated your finger, exposed and clear, without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and the probe, then know for certain that it is penetrating. Do not tire yourself over it, for there is no cure, as we said.
They say that it heals in some, rarely.  A treatment that is hoped to be beneficial is to heat a thin cautery, according to the size of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and to introduce it into the fistula until it reaches the vicinity of the anus, then repeat this two or three times.
So that you know that all the excess, congealed flesh, resembling a bird's feather tube, has been burned. Then treat it with a thread soaked in clarified butter to remove the burned flesh, and then treat it with healing ointments if it heals.
Otherwise, it will not heal with any other treatment.  If, however, you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the fistula close to the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula. While passing through the incision with the probe inside the fistula, continue the incision until it reaches where the end of the probe is, and the probe is removed and falls out. Then, clean away the congealed flesh, which resembles a bird's feather tube, leaving nothing of it.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals.  If blood overwhelms you and prevents you from completing the excision of that flesh, the best and fastest remedy is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine, because cauterization by fire combines two beneficial outcomes: burning away the excess flesh.
And cauterize the blood and dry out the moisture. Then treat it with a thread soaked in clarified butter or sulfur powder mixed with oil, until the area becomes purulent and the burned flesh is discharged in the pus.  Then treat the wound with healing ointments that promote the growth of firm flesh.
These are the remedies that have a binding and drying effect.  If it is healed, it has been cured, and there is no need for further intervention. However, if the fistula extends deep into the rectum and is distant from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh and it is close to breaking through, then the only action is by way of hope and expectation.  This means that you use one of three methods; either cauterize it, as we said.
Or else, to cut it open until you reach its bottom to enable you to introduce the thread and treatment from close proximity.  Do not proceed too far with the incision, lest you sever the muscle surrounding the rectum and cause the patient to expel stool involuntarily.  Then treat it as we mentioned; perhaps it will heal, as we said.
Or else, to pierce through that barrier and make a hole in it after cutting it open near the rectum, as we said, either with a probe or another sharp-edged instrument.  Then, cleanse all the hardened flesh in the incision to the best of your ability.
Then, treat the entire wound, including the incision and the upper opening, until it seals, and the fistula remains open inside the rectum.  This will be easier for the patient.  The fistula may heal in this way.
If, when inserting the probe into the fistula, it is on the side of the rectum towards the body surface, along with the skin and the rim of the rectum, then take a probe with a perforated tip, like a farrier's needle, in this way:
And insert a twisted thread of five threads, or so, into it. Then, insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom. If it is perforating the rectum's edge from within, near its edge.
Then pull the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the rectum and pulling the end of the thread. Tie the two ends together and leave them for a day or two.  Every time the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it firmly until the flesh between the ends of the threads breaks off and falls away. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the fistula is not perforated, then perforate it as best as you can, but do not do so if it is deep, because you should not do so due to the muscle so as not to cut it. Then do with it as we have described until it heals.
The shape of the pointed lancet used to pierce fistulas should have a very sharp curve on one side and a blunt curve on the other, so as not to cut anything that is not needed, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-one.
Concerning hemorrhoids that bleed, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are within the anus, resembling red blisters or like grapes, and they can be small or large, and blood constantly flows from them.
They can be single or multiple, and they can be outside the anus, at its edges. However, those outside the anus are usually less moist; a yellow liquid or little blood flows from them constantly, and they are the color of the body.
For those inside the anus, instruct the patient to defecate and strain until the anus is stretched and the polyps are visible.  Then quickly seize them with forceps or your fingernail, and cut them at their roots, if the forceps do not grasp them well because of their moisture and looseness.
Otherwise, grip it with a rough cloth or a piece of sharpened wood, or pull it with your fingers, then cut it, and after the cut, sprinkle some sharp powders on it to act as cautery, or cauterize it as described in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat it with other remedies until it heals.  If the anus does not yield, inject the patient with an enema containing a little irritant to wash what is in the anus and cause it to come out quickly when the patient strains.  As for polyps outside the anus, the treatment is simple and easy.
To remove them, grasp them with your fingernail or forceps, and cut them. Then treat them as described until they heal.  If cutting with iron is undesirable, one should use a needle. Take a twisted thread and thread it into the needle.
Then pull the polyp upward and pierce it with the needle at its base from the other side. Tie the ends of the thread below the needle, which is across it, and pull the polyp tightly. Then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the polyps, leaving one that is not pierced.
To cause the excess blood to flow, place a cloth soaked in rose oil or qirouti on the anus.  Tell the patient to rest, and leave it until it falls off.  If the polyps fall off, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often appear due to dryness and constipation. If they persist and remedies are ineffective, one should scrape them with a scalpel or fingernail until they become moist and the upper crust that prevents adhesion is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, scrape it more forcefully than before until it bleeds and the skin is peeled.  Then treat it, and it will heal.

On the treatment of ingrown nails, both ingrown and non-ingrown, dry warts, and moles.
The ingrown nail is a rounded, body-colored lump resembling the head of a nail, found throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and toes, and causes pain when walking.
One should dissect the tissue around the nail, grip it with a pick or a hook, and pull it from its root. Then treat it.  If desired, cauterize it, as previously described in the relevant section.  As for dry warts, each is a small, rough, hardened, round protuberance on the surface of the body.
They are often found on children's hands.  Treatment involves stretching the wart, cutting it, or piercing it with silk thread or a hair until it falls off.  If desired, cauterize it as previously described with fire or a caustic medicine.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument I have mentioned in the treatment of moles.  Moles are also small, hardened, thick protuberances on the skin, extending deeply into it. If they are exposed to cold, a sensation similar to the sting of an ant is felt.
They are found throughout the body, most often on the hands. Treatment involves taking a tube of strong goose or eagle feather, placing the tube around the mole until the tube encircles it completely, then rotating the tube to separate the tissue around the mole.
And push it into the flesh, so the mole is pulled out from its root. If desired, do this using a brass or iron tube in this manner:.
The top of the tube should be solid and twisted, so it is easy for the fingers to hold and turn it. If desired, cauterize the mole, as described in the chapter on cauterizing warts.

In images of instruments used for injections in diseases of the rectum, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, or porcelain, or of hollow or hammered brass.  Small and large versions of this instrument may be made, according to the user's needs. Those used for treating small children, or those with narrow or painful rectums, should have very fine syringes.  Image of a large syringe:.
Its upper funnel, where the bulb is attached, should be wide, with a partition where the bulb is attached, as you see.  Its lower end, which enters the rectum, should be very smooth and tight, with two holes on one side and one hole on the other.
The size of the holes should be the thickness of a reed, or slightly thicker. The bulb, into which the medicines are put, is made from an animal bladder or sheep's intestine, in the form of a small plate, with a diameter of one span.
Many holes are pierced in it, spirally, with a space between each hole the thickness of a finger.  A strong thread, made of twenty or so doubled threads, is then inserted into these holes, gathering the bulb together like a plate. Once the medicine is placed inside, tighten the head of the syringe firmly between the stones, and then administer.  This is an image of the bulb and its holes.
The method of administering is to fill the intestine or bladder with the medicine, warmed to the patient's tolerance.  Beware that it is not too hot or too cold.  Then the patient should lie on their back and raise their legs.
A mat or blanket is placed underneath.  Then the tip of the syringe is lubricated with ointment, egg white, or licorice juice, or similar.  The syringe is then gently inserted into the anus.  The attendant holding the bulb squeezes it firmly until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the intestines.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient lowers their legs. If the medicine prompts expulsion, the patient should hold it as long as possible.  If the patient sleeps with it all night, it will be more effective in the expulsion. If the enema is given for diarrhea and the expulsion is hurried, repeat the enema until the patient is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the anus, the syringe must be very gentle, smoother than those used for children.  This is an image of a gentle syringe, its skin tight.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the treatment of surgical wounds.
I have previously mentioned the treatment of burns in the classification.  Here, I will fully describe their treatment with the hand and medications.  Thus, surgical wounds vary according to the nature of the injury and the location of the wound.
The causes of wounds are numerous, such as a blow from a stone, a cut from a sword or knife, a spear or stick or arrow wound, and many other such things.
And as for wounds according to their locations on the body, they are like wounds that occur on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and other organs.
I will describe the treatment of some wounds to make them a standard and a rule for all wounds, and I will begin with simple head wounds, especially since complex ones will be mentioned in the first chapter of the third book of this book.
I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, if it is from a blow by a stone or similar, and only the skin is bruised, and the wound is large, and you fear the occurrence of a hot swelling, then immediately open the wound with a lancet in that location. Do not delay this, and draw out blood from him according to his strength, unless something prevents the lancing.  Especially if the blood coming from the wound is little, and let the lancing be from the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinking, and heavy foods. If something prevents lancing, then let him reduce his food intake, avoid meat and drinks, and apply a poultice of rose oil soaked cotton to the wound if a hot swelling occurs, either alone or with a drink that has astringent properties.
If you fear the hot swelling, apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and the air has not altered it, the ointment that I will describe to you shortly.  But if the air has altered it, apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large, and from a sword cut or similar, and its edges have not joined with sutures, then join them with stitches as I describe for the sutures of abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging, and its hold is only in a slight attachment, then cut it off. Then treat the wound with medications to build strong flesh in place of the skin. Tell the patient to eat foods with strength, such as heads and the like.
If the skin develops gangrene but is not attached to the bone, cut away all the gangrene and cauterize it, then treat it. If in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood is flowing and the bleeding has not stopped with medications, then search for the artery.
If you hit it and it doesn't stop, sever it with a lancet and tie it off. If the situation demands, and what we have mentioned is ineffective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and uncomplicated, their treatment is simple; it suffices to sprinkle this powder on them while they are still bloody.
Before the air changes it, the powder's recipe is: one part frankincense, two parts alum, and three parts quicklime or un-quicklime.  Grind them all, sieve them, and fill the wound with it, securing it firmly so it adheres well.
It will clot with the blood, then you secure it from above with dressings and leave it undisturbed as long as it does not swell.  The medicine will not be removed until it heals.  The lime alone can accomplish this if you do not have frankincense and alum.
This can also be done with the powder in many large wounds if its application and firm securing are properly executed, and the wounds are fresh with blood, provided the air has not altered them.  However, if the air has altered them, particularly in summer.
So, there is no effective use of this powder; instead, treat it as we have described, by applying some ripening ointment, or a paste of barley flour made with water and honey, until the pus matures.  Then treat it with further remedies until it heals.
However, if the wound has a minor fracture of the bone, pull it out with the bandage.  The treatment for skull fractures is discussed in the section on the neck.  If the wound is on the neck, there is no difference in treatment from a simple head wound.
If a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treatment with astringents like verdigris, alum, and similar substances, because they will injure and spasm the nerve.
Do not apply anything cold to the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold, and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  Use soothing remedies, such as moistened rose water or a mixture of oil and rose and zinc ointment.
If you also wash it with fresh water and other mineral substances in this manner, and with moist ointments; if the wound is large, use stitches or bring the edges together with bandages, and then treat until it heals.
If the wound has a cavity and pus has collected at the bottom, drain it from the lowest point.  If an artery has been severed in the wound and you see blood flowing, tie it off or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx, but the vessels are intact, bring together the edges of the skin with sutures along the larynx's cartilage. Do not touch the larynx itself, but smooth it and restore it to its natural shape, then tie it firmly and leave it for a few days.
Then treat it with ointments that have a binding and drying effect until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, probe it. If there are bone fragments, remove all or as many as possible. If not possible, leave it until the wound becomes necrotic and heals, making removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the powder we described.  If bone in the wound has become necrotic and is discharging pus, treat it as described in the section on chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see a cavity, observe it. If air comes out when the patient breathes, know that it is a fatal wound. If it has no cavity and is fresh with blood, do not initially use powder nor tighten it, lest blood be trapped in its cavity.
It will retreat to the heart and kill the patient.  Instead, apply a drawing ointment twice a day. If no ointment is available, place a softened cotton pad in the wound to absorb the moisture, and have the patient sleep with the wound uppermost.
To drain any collected matter.  If three days or more have passed, and the patient has not experienced spasms, a bad pulse, or shortness of breath, and you find the rest of their condition good, know that the wound is healthy, and treat it with bandages and other treatments until healed.
If viewing and expanding the wound consistently proves difficult, know that it has become discharging pus. Treat it accordingly.  The patient should lie on their back so that any accumulated matter may drain; if the wound is on the chest or back, treat it with the prior mentioned suturing.
If it is large, or dusted with powder if small; if it has affected the bone and chipped it, search the wound and promptly remove the fragments if they are loose. If they are not loose, leave them until...
The wound will fester, and this will make the removal easier.  As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, the treatment is the same as described.
Chapter Eighty-five.
On wounds of the abdomen, intestinal prolapse, and their suture.
A wound exposing the abdomen may be large, small, or medium.  A large wound may expose intestines or multiple intestines, making their replacement and suture more difficult and arduous.
A small wound, too, may present difficulty from another perspective, making replacement more challenging.  If the intestines are not returned to their place immediately, they swell and thicken, making their replacement more difficult.  Therefore, the best type of wound is a medium-sized one, as it does not present the difficulty in returning the intestines that the other two types do.
Know that there are four methods for suturing the abdomen. Two are general methods suitable for suturing the abdomen and other bodily wounds, while the other two are specialized methods, primarily applied to suturing the abdomen, although applicable to other wounds as well.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation. If the wound is small and some intestines protrude and their return is difficult, it is due to one of two reasons: either the smallness of the wound, as we mentioned, or because the intestines were previously inflated due to the cold air.
If this is the case, it is necessary to warm the intestines by dipping a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water, alone or with cooked ingredients like izhhar, su'adi, or senbel, and applying it to the intestines until the inflation subsides.
A solution with astringent properties may be used, which is better than water alone for resolving the inflation.  Once the inflation is resolved, moisten the intestines with water cooked with khutmi or khabazi, as this will facilitate their smoother return with less effort.
If, after this treatment, the intestines still cannot be returned, make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used for lancing boils.  The initial treatment, if successful, is preferable to incision, and incision is only resorted to as a last resort when all other methods fail.  This is a picture of the instrument:.
Its one curved side is limited, and the other side is not limited. The thin end is not as thin as a scalpel, but slightly blunted. It is a small instrument resembling a small lancet, as you see. If the wound is widened and the intestines have entered, it is necessary to return them to their natural shape.
Its specific location, if possible, is best.  If the wound is large and located in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs elevated higher than their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, the head and chest should be elevated higher than the lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always aim to keep the side with the incision higher than the other side.  This should also be observed in major and intermediate surgeries.
For smaller surgeries, place it as best you can, then have a helpful assistant hold the entire wound with their hands, bringing the edges together, and then gradually expose portions of it to the surgeon for stitching.
This is the general method of single-stitch closure: Take a needle or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Leave a space equivalent to the thickness of the little finger at the edge of the wound, and insert one needle without thread into the edges of the skin. Inserting the needle into the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin from the inside, so that you penetrate it from that side.  The edges of the skin and peritoneum are brought together, forming four layers.  Then, a doubled thread is pulled around the needle repeatedly from both sides until the wound edges are firmly closed.
Then leave a space equal to the thickness of a finger, and insert another needle.  Thread it as you did with the first needle. Continue in this way with as many needles as necessary to close the entire wound.  Use needles of medium thickness.
Because very thin needles easily cut the flesh, and thick needles are difficult to insert into the skin, the needles should be of medium thickness.  The needle should not be inserted near the edge of the skin.
So that the flesh does not tear quickly and the wound does not open before closing.  Also, do not sew too far apart, so that the wound does not prevent healing.  Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient when he sleeps, and make protective coverings of linen from each side to hold the ends of the needles.
Leave it until you know that the wound has healed.  This method of stitching with needles is best suited for small wounds, because it may suffice to use only one or two needles, or so.
Regarding the method of stitching for the common people, gather all four edges—the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum—in a single operation with a needle containing a thread of moderate thinness and thickness.  Then, after the needle has traversed these four edges, return the needle from the same side on which it began.
The thread should be interwoven over the wound to resemble the stitching used on bags to hold goods.  Leave a space equal to the thickness of a little finger between each stitch. This is a method of stitching known to all.
With this method of stitching, a surgical procedure was performed on a man who had a knife wound in his abdomen.  The surgical opening was more than a span, and approximately two spans of the small intestine had protruded. The opening was in the center of the abdomen.
After the intestines had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours, he returned them.  The wound healed in about fifteen days, and he was treated until he recovered.  He lived many years thereafter and was able to manage all his affairs.  Doctors had concluded that he would never recover.
Surprisingly, I did not treat him with any ointment because I was in a location lacking medicinal supplies.  I used used cotton on the wound twice daily, and carefully washed it with honey water until it healed.
Concerning one of the special types of stitching, I mention it based on Galen's text: begin stitching from the skin, inserting the needle from outside to inside.  Once the needle pierces the skin and the muscle extending straight along the entire abdomen...
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle.  Insert the needle into its opposite edge, from inside to outside.  Then insert it again into this same edge of the peritoneum, from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and insert the needle into its opposite edge, from inside to outside.  While inserting it into the peritoneum, proceed to the edge of the mesentery on its side, inserting the needle fully into it.
Then, begin again from this same side and follow the edge that is of the peritoneum on the opposite side, pulling the needle out of the skin near it and then returning it to that skin. Follow the edge of the peritoneum that is on the opposite side and this edge of the mesentery.
Pull it out of the skin on its side, and do that again, and do it repeatedly until the entire surgical wound is sutured in this manner. The general description of this suture is like the way furriers sew fur.
By suturing the peritoneum once from one side to the edge of the skin, and leaving it once from the other side until it is empty.  As for the second type of specialized suture that Galen also mentioned, this is his wording verbatim.
It is that you suture it in the manner some healers suture, by bringing each part to its corresponding opposite part naturally.  They bring the edge of the peritoneum to its opposite edge, and the edge of the mesentery to its opposite edge, in the way I am describing to you.
The needle should be inserted into the edge of the mesentery near you from the outside, penetrating it from the outside to the inside, and leaving the edges of the peritoneum alone. Then, return the needle and penetrate it from the outside to the inside in both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again.
And penetrate it from the inside to the outside in the edge of the other mesentery on the opposite side. This type of suture is better than the common, easy suture previously mentioned. This is Galen's wording verbatim. Some have said that the abdomen may be sutured with two needles. This is done by inserting a single thread in them, beginning by inserting the needle from your side and penetrating to the other side, and inserting the other needle from the opposite side, penetrating to your side, in the manner of cobbler's suture.
Know that if the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, its suture is more difficult than other parts of the abdomen.  As for the treatment of the wound, its treatment is like other surgical wounds.  If you catch the wound fresh with its blood, before the air alters it, you return the bowels, suture it well, and reinforce it, then apply the medicated poultice to it.
If the wound has been altered by the air, apply some of the ointments you have available until it suppurates, and the sutures fall out, and the peritoneum and mesentery are joined together. Then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals.
If you do not have medications available, apply a piece of worn cotton as soon as it begins to suppurate, and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.  You will not usually require any further treatment if the wounds are minor, unless you fear that the wound might involve pain in the major organs.
You should dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpits.  If he feels pain or putrefaction in his bowels, which frequently occurs, flush him with a lukewarm, black astringent drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the bowels and become a penetrating wound into the abdomen. Know that the thick parts of the intestines are easier to heal, and the thin parts are harder to heal.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it will not heal at all from a wound that occurs in it, due to the abundance and size of the veins in it, the thinness of its substance, and its proximity to the nerve.  However, if the protrusion from the wound is still fresh, return it to its place as you would return a bowel of the same type.
If it has been a while, and it has turned green or black, you should tie it with thread over the blackened area to prevent bleeding, as the protrusion contains veins and arteries. Then cut what is below that ligament.
And leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside of it, so it is easy for you to pull it and remove it when the protrusion falls out and the wound becomes suppurated.  This describes the wound that occurs in the intestines.  Now, if a rupture occurs in the intestines, and it is small...
Some people may recover from it, for I have seen a man who had been wounded in his belly by a spear thrust. The wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound festered and pus formed, from which feces and wind came out. I treated him, not expecting him to recover. I continued to treat him until he recovered and the area healed.  When I saw the area had healed, I feared that the patient might suffer a bad incident in his belly, but no such incident occurred, and he remained in the best of health. Indeed, he ate, drank, had intercourse, went to the bath, and engaged in physical activity in his service. Some experienced individuals have stated that if a small wound appears in the intestines, it should be treated in this manner.
Large ants are taken, and the edges of the wound are brought together.  Then, one ant, its mouth open, is placed on the wound edges.  If it bites down and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off, and it adheres and does not separate. Then another ant is placed near the first.
You continue to do this with several ants, depending on the size of the wound.  Then, the wound is closed and stitched.  These ant heads remain attached to the intestines until the intestines heal and the patient recovers without any further harm.  The intestines can also be stitched with fine thread.
The method for removing the animal's adhesive from the thread after it has entered the needle is to take the end of this thread from the adhesive, and pulling it out.  Then a thin, spun linen thread is tied to the end, and this linen thread is inserted into the needle. The thread of the adhesive is used to stitch the intestines, then returned to the cavity.  This type of suturing with ants and adhesive is only by way of hope and expectation.
If the tear is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy, and there is no cure.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On the treatment of colds and nasal obstructions.
Know that any wound or tumor, if it becomes chronic, old, and ulcerated, and does not heal, and constantly discharges pus without ceasing, is generally called, in any organ, a fistula, and we call it a cold, or fistula.
It is, in truth, a hard, dense, white mass, without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of bird's feathers.
Therefore, some called it a feather, and it is sometimes moist, constantly discharging pus, and perhaps the moisture may cease at times.  This moisture may be copious or slight, thick or thin.
I previously presented in the classification of surgical conditions that any ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow is due to one of nine causes. One of these is either due to the scarcity of blood in the body, or its poor quality, or that inside it, and on its edges, there is hard flesh preventing the growth of good flesh. Or that it is excessive in harm and filth, or that the ulcer itself is foul, and the matter that it discharges is of bad quality, or that the treatment is not appropriate, or that there is a pestilential corruption in the region, or due to a specific condition in the region.
Or that it is excessive in harm and filth, or that the ulcer itself is foul, and the matter that it discharges is of bad quality, or that the treatment is not appropriate, or that there is a pestilential corruption in the region, or due to a specific condition in the region. As demonstrated in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is slow naturally, or because there is one bone or several bones present.  I have shown all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the classification.
Here, I must introduce you to the treatment of fistulas and colds which are treated manually. Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body, some leading to large veins and arteries, or to a nerve.
or to the peritoneum, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the many joints of the hand or foot, some leading to the vicinity of a major organ, and the like.
Therefore, those fistulas of this type are among the difficult-to-cure diseases, which do not accept treatment and working on them is laborious and ignorant. If there are fistulas that do not reach these locations that I have mentioned, and I hope and expect to treat them...
If you wish to ascertain this, take a probe of copper or iron. If the fistula runs straight, examine it with it. If there is a bend in the fistula, examine it with a thin lead probe, for lead is pliable.
If it bends upon entering and turns toward the bend, if the fistula has many openings that you cannot locate with the probe, inject one of its openings, for the moisture you inject will travel towards the other openings and flow out.
Then, thoroughly investigate in any way possible to determine whether there is bone or nerve, whether the fistula's bottom is distant or near, or whether it is a single fistula with multiple openings.  Determine all of this with the extent of your keen, thorough examination and the pain when you touch the area.
And similar to these are the signs and causes that lead to the swelling.  If you have established all this accurately, then proceed to treatment with certainty, by considering whether...
If the fistula is superficial and close to the surface, or in a healthy location far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the locations previously mentioned, incise the fistula according to the description I have given, and remove the hardened tissue, corrupted flesh, and excessive flesh from it.
And treat any flesh or warts that grow in its opening, until it heals. If the fistula is deep and straight, you should incise it as deeply as possible, then clean it of all corrupted flesh.
Then use a twisted applicator with potent medicines and insert them into the fistula's bottom, which you can feel with the instrument; repeat this several times until the potent medication consumes any remaining corruption in the fistula's bottom.
Then apply ointments that promote healthy tissue growth until it heals.  If it does not heal this way, cauterize it according to the description previously given. If the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, probe and incise it as I have described, unless something prevents you from doing so.
If it is a vein, nerve, or important organ, as we have said, and if the bone is exposed to you and has some corruption and blackness, scrape it until the corruption is gone, then treat it with something that promotes healing until it heals. If it does not heal and the pus persists as it used to,
Know that you have not reached complete removal of the corruption.  Therefore, expose all of it again, thoroughly scraping and cleaning it with all your effort, and then apply a remedy. If it heals, well and good. Otherwise, understand that this corruption lies deep within the festering, and expose everything once more.
Thoroughly scrape and clean it with all your effort.  If the corrupt bone is small and you can pull it out, pull it out with the delicate forceps suitable for the task.
If there are many bones, thoroughly extract them all, leaving nothing behind. If any ligaments impede you, and cutting them poses no risk, cut those ligaments and the flesh if there is any, and liberate the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones immediately, apply something to the wound to putrefy it, and leave it for days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones putrefy.  Keep the wound open; do not allow the incision you made during your work to close.
But if you fear that, place on it a cotton swab soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment, or one of the green ointments.  If the ligaments putrefy and the bones become loose, their removal and extraction will be easier.
If it is a single large bone, like the shinbone or thighbone, and only its surface has become corrupted, thoroughly clean it until the blackness and corruption disappear, then close the wound.  If a large part of it has become corrupted, and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, it is necessary to break it open.
And cut it all the way to where the corruption ends.  Then treat it until it heals.  I will tell you about a case of a man's leg that occurred to illustrate and help your treatment.  This man was young.
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a condition originating within the body, causing the materials to reach the leg and swell into a large tumor. There was no external cause.  Then, time passed with the doctors' errors until the tumor opened.
A great deal of material flowed from it, and his treatment was poor, until the leg became gangrenous and had many openings, all discharging pus and body fluids.  A group of physicians treated him for about two years, but none were skillful surgeons.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg, with a great deal of material flowing from those openings. The man's body was emaciated, and his complexion was yellow. I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and it reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
I found that some of them connected to others from all sides of the leg.  I proceeded to open one of those openings, exposing some of the bone. I found it corrupted, eaten away, blackened, rotten, and riddled with holes, penetrating to the marrow. I reported what I had discovered.
I removed the corrupted bone, and I believe that the bone contained nothing but that corruption that I had removed and reported.  Then I treated the wound with healing medicines for a long time, but it did not heal.  I then uncovered the bone again, beyond the initial exposure.
I found the corruption attached to the bone. I reported what corruption I had further uncovered.  Then I attempted to heal it, but it did not heal or close. I further exposed it, and I continued to remove the bone, piece by piece, and tried to heal it, but it would not heal until I removed about a span of bone.
I removed it, along with its marrow. Then I healed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and recovered.  This repetition of the procedure and its incisions was necessary due to the patient's weakness, his inability to endure, and my fear of his death, as he was often experiencing fainting spells from excessive vomiting. He recovered completely.
Solid flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his condition in the body improved. His strength returned, and he resumed his activities.  He was not hindered in his walking, and no damage occurred.  If a bone in any part of the body had broken.
It is necessary to treat it in this way:  Take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone. Have someone pull it upward.  Use another thicker woolen bandage.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone, pulling its end to draw the flesh downward.  Expose the flesh at the location you want to treat, so that the saw does not injure it. Place a board or plank under the bone from below, firmly secured.
For if you do this, the saw will not fail to cut the corrupted bone. The incision should be slightly above the corrupted area, so that any corruption within the bone cavity does not appear on the surface, forcing you to perform the procedure again.
If the bone is corrupted but not protruding, if its parts are connected but the corruption is in the middle or part of it, expose the flesh from all sides. Place the board underneath, then cut it from the first side where the corruption is.
After completing the incision, cut from the other side.  The incision should be a short distance from the corruption, as previously stated. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and cut the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but removal. If the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or foot, the treatment is extremely difficult.  However, you should scrape off the corruption however it appears, remove it, and clean it by any means possible.
By any method that works, as long as you do not encounter a vein or nerve.  Know that the tools—knives and saws—used to cut these bones vary according to the position, shape, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and fragility of the bones. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a tool suited to each type of work.
Know that the work itself will indicate the type of tool you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of the craft's techniques, for the skilled craftsman who has observed various diseases. He may invent similar tools for each disease, and I have illustrated several tools at the end of this chapter.
These will serve as examples to be followed and used as a guide for others, God willing.  Image of a saw:

Chapter Eighty-seven.
On the amputation of limbs and the spreading of bones.
Limbs may become putrid either from an external cause or from an internal one.  If you treat this decay with medicinal remedies and the treatment does not work, and you see the decay spreading within the limb and nothing stops it.
Then it is necessary to amputate that limb at the point where the decay has reached, in order to save the patient from death or from a great harm greater than the loss of the limb. A sign that someone is suffering from this is that the limb darkens, until you think that fire has burned it.
Or it rots after darkening, until the rot spreads to what is next to that limb and affects the rest of the body.  So act quickly to amputate it.  Similarly, if the cause of the decay is a sting from creatures like the sea scorpion, snake, or centipede, and the like.
If the decay or the sting is in the tip of the finger, amputate the finger and do not delay the decay to spread to the hand.  Likewise, if the decay has reached the hand, amputate it from the base of the forearm and do not delay the decay to spread further to the elbow of the arm.
Similarly, if it has reached the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow joint. If the decay has spread to the shoulder area, do not amputate the shoulder at all, as this would cause the patient's death.  Use other treatments, to the best of your ability.
Likewise, do the same with the leg. If the decay reaches the toe, amputate the toe at one of the phalanges. If it reaches the instep of the foot, amputate the entire leg. If it ascends to the knee, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
If the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it and allow the patient to die.  The method of amputating or dissecting a limb is to tie a bandage at the bottom of the place you intend to cut, and tie another bandage above the place.
One attendant pulls the lower bandage downwards, another attendant pulls the upper bandage upwards.  You yourself, using a wide scalpel, expose all the flesh between the bandages. Then, cut or dissect it.  And you should place linen cloths on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the correct place, causing the patient excessive pain and a hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the area quickly or apply some sharp hemostatic agents. Then, return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I tell you by way of example, a man suffered this very affliction in his leg, that is, a dark discoloration with burning resembling fire.
This decay first appeared in his finger, and it spread to his whole foot. The man, seeing the decay spreading through the limb, and feeling severe pain and burning, amputated it at the joint and recovered.
After a long time, this same decay appeared in his index finger.  He came to me. I treated it with remedies applied to the hand, after cleaning his body, but the decay was not deterred and began to spread to the other finger.
Until the decay spread to his entire hand. He urged me to amputate his hand. I refused, hoping to deter the decay, and fearing death for him if I amputated his hand, as his strength was waning.  When he despaired of my help, he left for his own country.
I later heard that he eventually amputated his entire hand and recovered. I have related this story to aid in understanding this type of illness and as a guide for treatment.
Eighty-eighth Chapter.
In the treatment of abscesses and how to inject medications into them.
If a tumor develops in any fleshy part of the body and persists for a considerable time, then bursts or discharges, and expels all the material within, leaving the area empty like a vessel.
The skin over it is like a thin rag, and the damage is not severe enough to affect the bone, nerves, or ligaments.  Therefore, it is called an abscess, not a fistula, unless the duration is prolonged to the point where the corruption affects one of these structures.
Then it is called a fistula or ulcer, and its treatment is to cut away all the skin surrounding it, especially if it is thin and like a rag, and you are certain that it is not adhering to the area due to its corruption.
If you suspect the skin will adhere, and the corruption has not reached that extent, and there is thick flesh in the skin, treat it with injections.  Look at the abscess; if it is large and the pus emanating from it has a foul odor, inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris, equal parts mixed in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens and reaches the consistency of honey. Then take what you need of it, thin it with water and honey, inject it into the abscess, tighten its opening, and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then extract it by pressing.  Do this for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.  You may inject it with ash water if this medicine is not available, which is to take the ash of grapevine wood or oak wood and pour water over it.
Then strain it and inject it until you are certain that the abscess has been washed out. If the ailment is not amenable to the Egyptian medicine or ash water, inject it with water and honey mixed with some powdered verdigris.
Or inject it with honey and a drink mixed together, for honey has the power to cleanse and wash, and the drink will adhere to the abscess, especially if the drink has a quality of tightening and drying.  If you do this repeatedly and are certain that the corruption of the abscess is gone, inject it with something that promotes flesh growth in it.
For example, take some palm ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and a astringent drink, or inject it with some other medicines and ointments whose properties we have shown in the treatise on ointments. If the opening of the abscess is narrow and the syringe cannot reach it.
Then widen it slightly with a sharp instrument, or place a thread soaked in Egyptian ointment or Sirigon ointment within it so that it widens. Also, if the opening is wide, bring its edges together by stitching and leave it to the extent that the syringe can enter it without further widening.
Also, if the opening from which pus drips is elevated, slit it at the lowest point so that the pus drains downwards, because if the pus is concentrated in the depths of the abscess, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you cannot slit the abscess downward as desired, then position the affected area so that the pus flows out easily, according to what suits you, and do not allow any pus to remain trapped within it.
As for the adhesive medications applied to the abscess from the outside and how to apply them, take one of the adhesive ointments that suits your needs, spread it on a linen cloth, making the cloth large enough to cover the entire abscess. Then, using scissors, cut a hole slightly larger than the abscess opening at the abscess opening's edge. Next, spread some soft ointment onto another cloth, sized to fit the hole, and place it on the abscess, keeping a distance from the opening to allow the pus to exit more easily.  Do not remove the large cloth until later.
For several days, the one on the abscess opening is the one you remove periodically to drain any accumulated pus.  Observe whether the discharged pus is copious or scant, and whether it is mature or immature.
Furthermore, check the abscess site itself to see if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is swelling or not.  If your treatment continues in this manner and you observe that the material coming out through the abscess opening is scant,
Then know that the abscess has adhered or is approaching adhesion.  In that case, treat it again tomorrow or on the third day.  When you treat the wound, change the cloths and renew the ointment. If after a long time, thin pus comes out from the abscess, do not despair of its adhesion.
Then healing is near, because some people have slow wound healing, while others have rapid healing. If, after many days, unripe pus comes out from the abscess, know that the abscess has not adhered. If the abscess's adhesion is delayed,
Then increase the drying medicines.  Let the medicines be moist in consistency and dry in strength, like the ointment of palm tree sap if an excess of colophony has been added.  The most effective treatment is to use the palm tree ointment.
It can be treated with rose oil, and powdered old, moderate-strength, liquid medicine is sprinkled on it, and then mixed with it and used.  Similar action can be taken if the palm tree ointment is unavailable.  Honey can be used if cooked until thickened, or take myrrh, aloes, and kender, powder them all, and sprinkle them on honey over a fire. Then apply it to a cloth and bind it to the abscess, or apply the thickened honey, sprinkle the medications on it, place the cloth on it and bind it.
Also used in similar cases are long zeraound, the root of the asphodel, the flour of kresenna, and wild rue, either individually or mixed, ground, sifted, and sprinkled on the honey I described and applied. If the abscess persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption within it.
If it has affected the bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it like a boil, as previously described.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
On treating the ingrown toenail, the injured fingernail, the removal of excess finger and the separation of fused fingers.
The ingrown toenail is an overgrowth of flesh beneath the fingernail of the hand or foot, and may appear on other fingers. If it persists and is left untreated, it swells into a painful boil.
Or it may fester and decay, eating away at the nail root and possibly the whole nail.  The decay may even reach the bone, producing a foul odor, widening the fingertip, and causing a dark discoloration.  If treatment with the methods mentioned in the section is unsuccessful,
then all excess growth from the nail should be cut away with a knife, and the wound cauterized afterwards.  Cauterization is very effective in this case.  However, if the bone and nail are sound,
and the nail's edge had pressed the flesh inwards, causing irritation and injury, then a thin strip of material should be placed under the offending edge of the nail, lifting it upwards, and the flesh gently trimmed away.
Then apply cauterizing and corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh until it is all gone, and treat the area with ointments until healed. If the decay has affected the bone, however, then the bone must be cut out and removed, as a diseased bone will never heal.
If you see decay and ulceration spreading through the finger, amputate it at one of the phalanges, as previously described, then treat it until healed.  If the nail is injured or wounded, causing intense pain, then you should first apply leeches to the affected area.
Then, using a sharp scalpel, slit the nail with a slanted incision from top to bottom, taking care not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail, as this will cause the affected area considerable pain and lead to excess flesh growth in that spot. Then treat the area with remedies that relieve pain.
As for the extra finger that sometimes grows on some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or may have some bone, or even a nail; and some of it may grow from the joint of another finger.
Or it may grow from some of the finger's phalanges; and those that grow on the phalanges do not move, whereas those growing from the finger joint might move.  If it is entirely fleshy, removal is easy: cut it at its base with a broad scalpel.
However, if it grows from the joint, treatment is difficult.  Avoid cutting it.  As for one that grows on a finger at one of the phalanges, you should first cut away the flesh, in a circular motion, leaving the bone exposed.  Then, use one of those saws appropriate for the task to expose the bone.
Then treat it until it heals.  As for the adhesion that sometimes occurs between fingers, it is a frequent occurrence, often present from birth, or resulting from a wound or burn, or similar.  It is necessary to slit the adhesion.
So that the fingers return to their natural form.  Then place between them a gauze or linen pad soaked in rose oil, lest they adhere quickly; or separate them with a thin sheet of lead until the area heals properly.
Likewise, if adhesion occurs between some fingers and the palm, slit the adhesion according to what is appropriate and beneficial for the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
In the cutting of veins.
Veins are twisted, thick veins filled with dark, blackish blood, occurring in most parts of the body, but most frequently in the legs, especially in those who are often on foot, carriers, and porters.  First, it is necessary to use vigorous brushing of the body to remove the black blood repeatedly.
Then, lance the affected person's vein.  Treatment with iron comes in two forms: one is to cut and remove the black blood, and the other is to sever the vein and remove it entirely.  As for the cutting, the leg should first be soaked in hot water.
Until the thick, murky blood becomes fluid.  Then, the patient's leg is tied with a cloth from above the thigh to below the knee.  The vein is then cut in one, two, or three wide incisions.
Then, remove the black blood with your hand, from the bottom of the leg to the top, and from the top to the bottom, until you have removed the amount of blood you deem sufficient, or what the patient's strength permits. Then, bandage the area and tell the patient to avoid foods that produce black blood.  Emesis and venesection should be repeated.
When the veins become filled again, harming the patient,  as for severing it, it is done in this way: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair, then place them in a bath and soak the leg in hot water until it turns red and sweats, or engage in strenuous exercise.
If a bath is unavailable to warm the limb, then cut the skin alongside the vein lengthwise, either near the knee or at the heel. Then, open the skin with hooks and scrape the vein from all sides until it is visible.
When it appears, you will see it red and glistening.  Once it is freed from the skin, it will appear like a tendon. Then, insert a probe underneath it until it rises and protrudes from the skin.  Fasten it with a smooth, blunt hook.  Then make another incision near the first one, about the width of three fingers.
Then, scrape the skin off the vein until it is exposed.  Then, elevate it with the probe as you did before and fasten it with another hook, as you did initially.  Then, make another incision, or several incisions, if needed.
Then, sever and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, and pull it out.  Sever and pull it until it emerges from the second incision.  Then pull it to the incision above, and do this until you pull it out from the third incision, above all the others.  Once all of it is out, cut it.
If pulling and scraping are not effective, insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread, tie it, and pull it. Insert the probe underneath and twist your hand in every direction until it comes out, being careful not to break it. If it breaks, it will be very difficult to remove it.
This will bring harm to the patient.  Once you have removed it completely, place wool soaked in a potion and rose water or oil on the wound sites and treat it until healed. If the varicose vein is tense, with bends and twists in different directions...
And if it is not straight, as we said, then you should make an incision on each bend and twist, and then fasten it with hooks until you have removed it entirely.  Be careful when making incisions not to cut or injure the vein, for this will make its removal difficult, and conserve your effort.
Image of the incision used for removing the varicose vein.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not have a bend like other hooks, nor should its tip be sharp to avoid injuring the vein.  It should be thick and smooth in its bend, because if it is thin, it will cut the vein with its thinness.  Rather, it should have a degree of thickness, as we said.
Chapter Ninety-one.
In the treatment of a local vein.
This vein arises in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and the Arab lands, and in hot, sparsely populated lands.  It may also arise in other parts of the body besides the legs, originating from an ulceration beneath the skin.
As it occurs within the bodies of snakes, worms, and the rot of pumpkins and worms that form between the skin and flesh.  A sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a severe inflammation will occur in the leg, then the affected area will swell, and then the vein will begin to emerge from the location of the swelling.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal, and once its tip is exposed, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one to two dirhams, tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it outwardly, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it grows too long, cut off some of it and wrap the remainder. Do not cut it from its root before all of it comes out, because if you cut it, it will shrink and enter the flesh, causing a tumor, ulcer, and a bad sore in the area.
Therefore, it should be slowly drawn out until all of it emerges from the body, and nothing remains inside. In some people, this vein may reach a length of five or ten cubits.
I have heard that it has emerged from a man to a length of twenty cubits. If it breaks during your treatment, insert a reed into its opening, and press it firmly against the body for a long time until all the matter within is expelled.  Try to heal the affected area with medications for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors.  This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint or the leg itself, forming many openings, and a branch coming out of each opening. Treat it as described in the classification and as previously mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
On the abscess on the worm that forms under the hoof, and is called the "cow's disease.
This disease is called "cow's disease" in some of our countries because it often affects cows. It is a single small worm that forms between the skin and flesh, crawling throughout the body, both up and down.
Its movement from one limb to another can be felt, until it pierces the skin at a point, emerging and forming a collection of pus, as seen in worms, snakes, and the affliction of gourds in the abdomen.
However, the danger from it is that if it crawls through the body and ascends to the head and reaches the eye, it may pierce the eye and emerge, rendering it useless.  This frequently occurs.  Therefore, if you wish to treat it and remove it, it must be done when it is crawling and is detectable by touch.
Therefore, you should tie tightly around it above and below with a good bandage, then lance it and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply cauterization with fire to the affected area until it is burned.  The greatest risk is its damaging the eye, as we have said.
If you see it has reached the head, near the eye, tie tightly beneath it on the forehead, then lance it and remove it.  The patient should be treated to cleanse the body with medications that loosen foul and bad humours and should avoid foods that generate putrefaction.
Ninety-third Chapter.
On lancing the disease known as the "nafir".
This disease, called "nafir" in our country, is a pain that appears in certain organs, then spreads from one organ to another.  I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was summoned to a woman afflicted in a certain rural area.  She bared her arm and showed me a slight swelling in the vein of the arm.  After an hour, I saw the swelling creeping up her forearm like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as possible, like quicksilver.
If it travels from one place to another, the pain disappears from that spot and settles in the shoulder. Then, after an hour, it spreads throughout the rest of the body, eventually reaching the other arm.  She then recounted to me that it circulated throughout her entire body, as I had witnessed.
I was amazed by the speed of its transfer from organ to organ.  Before, I had only heard of this disease, where pain moves from one part of the body to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes like this in this woman.
I attributed it only to the fact that the woman was from the desert, with a dry body and exposed veins.  Therefore, this moving pain was perceptible.  It should not manifest in this way in those who are well-off, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it, and the patient feels the pain visibly, as we have described, then quickly compress above and below it, and lance it until the congested air escapes and the site is relieved.
If you do not see it visibly, treat it by shaking the body, and by remedies that dispel and disperse wind, such as rotten seeds, and "seeds of the skink" and similar medications.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows vary according to their types and the locations of their impact on the body.  Their variations include large and small, hollow and solid glass, three-sided and four-sided.
Some have tongues, others have splinters.  Regarding location in relation to the body parts affected, there are two types. Either they strike hollow major organs like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar. If an arrow strikes one of these organs and signs of death, which I will describe to you later, appear, you should avoid removing the arrow, as death will befall the afflicted in most cases. If these unfavorable signs do not appear and the arrow is not lodged deep within the organ, remove it and treat the wound.  Signs of an arrow striking the brain, piercing the bone, and wounding the meninges include severe headache, dizziness, and vertigo.
If these unfavorable signs do not appear and the arrow is not lodged deep within the organ, remove it and treat the wound.  Signs of an arrow striking the brain, piercing the bone, and wounding the meninges include severe headache, dizziness, and vertigo. Redness in the eyes and tongue, convulsion, confusion of mind, vomiting, and possibly bleeding from the nostrils or ears.  Speech and voice may cease, and a white, porridge-like moisture may emerge from the wound, dripping like the watery part of meat.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not already been removed.  Regarding signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is near the left breast and felt as if embedded in something hard rather than empty, ...
Perhaps the arrow's movement resembles a pulse, and dark blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.  Know that death is inevitable. A sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the expulsion of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels near the neck swell, the patient's complexion changes, breathing is labored, and they crave cool air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the smaller ribs, and breathing will be labored with severe pain.
He sighs and all the shoulder muscles move. If the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows, and blood resembling liver in color comes from the wound. If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food may come from the wound.
The situation is clear. If the arrow strikes the abdomen, perforates it, and feces, pus, or intestines emerge from the wound, there is no hope for treatment or arrow removal. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine emerges, ...
If something protrudes from the wound and the patient's pain intensifies, know that he is doomed.  As for other organs such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are more likely to survive.
Unless the arrow has struck an artery or nerve, and unless the arrow is poisoned, I will tell you about some things I have witnessed regarding these arrows, so you can use that to guide your treatment.  An arrow struck a man's eye socket at the base of his nose.
I removed an arrow for him from the other side, under the earlobe, and he recovered without any harm to his eye.  I also removed another arrow for a Jew who had been struck in the earlobe under his lower eyelid; the arrow had disappeared, and only its small tip, which adheres to the shaft, remained.
It was a large arrow, from a compound bow, with square, smooth iron, and no wings.  The Jew recovered without any problems with his eye.  I also removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian man; the arrow was Arab-made.
It had wings, and I cut through the cartilage on each side of the wound where it had embedded in his throat, gently extracting it. The Christian man recovered. I also removed another arrow from a man's abdomen, and we thought he would die from it.
After about thirty days, or so, and showing no change in his condition, I cut around the arrow, maneuvering to extract it.  He recovered without incident. I saw a man with an arrow embedded in his back, where the wound had closed over it.
Then, seven years later, the arrow emerged from the base of his thigh. I saw a woman with an arrow in her abdomen, where the wound had closed over it. The arrow remained, and her condition remained unchanged, causing no problems with her normal activities.
I saw another man with an arrow in his face, where the wound had closed over it.  He felt little pain.  Many cases like this. I removed an arrow from the nose of a sultan's officer, which was slightly off to the right side of the middle of his nose.
The arrowhead had disappeared entirely.  I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck.  I found the arrow wound very tight.  I probed it with a thin instrument, but felt nothing.  He was experiencing a prickling sensation and pain under his ear on the right side.
I hoped this prickling was from a part of the arrow, so I applied a dressing that would draw out pus and promote maturation, hoping the area would swell and reveal the arrowhead so I could extract it.  However, there was no sign that the arrow had reached that spot.
I continued using the dressing for many days, but nothing happened.  The wound eventually healed, and the patient gave up hope of removing the arrow.  One day, he felt the arrow inside his nose and told me.  I applied a strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it, feeling the fine tip of the arrow, which was embedded in the wood.  I then increased the application of the strong medicine to the wound until the arrowhead itself became visible.  This took about four months.
Then, once the wound had widened and I could insert the forceps, I pulled and moved it, but it wouldn't come out.  I continued to manipulate it with various instruments until, one day, I grasped it firmly with strong forceps, as depicted later in this chapter.
The physicians had judged that his nasal cartilage could not be repaired, but I repaired it. The wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, free from any further pain.  I am telling you how I removed this arrow to use as a model and guide for cases I have not described.
For the parts and details of this craft cannot be grasped through description, nor contained within a book.  Instead, the skilled craftsman draws comparisons from the little to the much, from the known to the unknown, and invents new methods and instruments when faced with unusual cases.
Concerning this craft, I say that arrows are removed from the body parts they entered in two ways: either by pulling them out from the entry point, or from the opposite side, the way they entered.
If the arrow is protruding through fleshy tissue, pull it out.  If it is not easily removed at the point of entry, you should leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh has festered, making removal easier.  The same applies if it is lodged in bone.
If it does not come out, leave it for a few days and try pulling and moving it daily.  It will come out. If it still does not come out after a few days, you should make small holes around the arrow in the bone itself from all sides using a fine drill bit, widening the space around the arrow, then pull it out.
If the arrow is lodged in the skull and has penetrated one of the brain cavities, and some of the symptoms I mentioned are present, refrain from pulling the arrow out and leave it for a few days until the situation improves.
Proceed with pulling out the arrow. If it is deeply embedded and cannot be easily pulled out, use the drills around the arrow as described. Then treat the wound until it heals.  As for if the arrow is concealed in a part of the body... If it is hidden from sight, probe with a sounder. If you feel it, pull it out using suitable instruments. If you cannot, because the wound is too narrow and the arrow is deeply embedded, and there is no bone, nerve or blood vessel in the way,
widen the wound to make room to retrieve the arrow. If the arrow has two nocks, grasp them and detach any flesh around them by any possible means.  If detaching the flesh is impossible, break and twist the nocks to remove them.
If you attempt to remove the arrow in any location, twist your hand with forceps in all directions to remove it. Be extremely gentle so that the arrow does not break, making it more difficult to remove. If you are unable to do so with your current efforts,
leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh rots, then try again.  It will be easier then. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments described in the relevant section, and take care to avoid severing any blood vessels, nerves, or tendons.  Employ all possible means.
Use every method you can to remove the arrow, being gentle, patient, and firm as described.  When pulling the arrow, make sure the patient's body is in the same position as it was when the arrow was lodged, as this is most effective.
If you cannot do that, use whatever method you can.  As for an arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either a portion will be protruding outwardly, or you will find the arrowhead close to the skin surface, visible on the top.
Cut a slit in it, making the slit large enough for the forceps to grasp.  Then pull it out, as it will be easier to remove.  If it's lodged in bone, twist your hand in a circular motion until the arrow is affected in the bone and makes space for itself, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for several days and try again until it comes out.  If the arrowhead remains, push it with it.  If the arrowhead has fallen off and you want to use pushing, insert the hollow instrument into the shaft of the arrow, and use it to push it out.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that fits into the hollow.  The arrow will be easier to remove in this way.  If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize all the flesh that is affected by the poison if possible, then treat it with appropriate remedies.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side, and is close enough to be felt with a probe, and you can slit the area, cut a slit and be careful not to sever a nerve or vein and remove it.
Then suture the wound if it needs stitching, and treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps used to extract arrows:.
Its tips are like the beak of a bird, crafted to resemble a file. When gripping an arrow or something else, it doesn't let go.  Different sizes, large, small, and medium, can be made, all according to the size of the arrow, the size of the wound, and its width.

This one is solid at the end, like a rod, to easily enter the hollow arrow and push it out.

On bloodletting.
The veins customarily opened in the body are thirty; sixteen of them are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the *ḥassisīn*; the two arteries in the temples, visible; and the two veins in the eye sockets, known as the *nāẓirīn*.
And the vein standing out in the middle of the forehead, the vein in the tip of the nose, the two in the neck, the two in the upper lip of the mouth, the two in the lower lip, these veins known as the *jayārka*, and the two veins below the tongue.
And as for the veins opened in the arm and hand, they are five. One is the *qayfāl*, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the vein of the head.  The *ʾakḥal*, the middle vein, is composed of a branch of the *bāsiliq* and a branch of the *qayfāl*; the common people call it the body vein.
And the *bāsiliq*, which is situated on the inner side, also called the armpit vein; the common people call it the belly vein and the arm cord.  It is situated on the forearm, where it adheres; and it is the one that clearly appears above the thumb, the *ʾāsīlim*.
It is the vein between the pinky and ring finger, having two branches; and in the leg and foot, there are three veins. One is under the knee bend on the outer side; the second is the *ṣāfin*, located at the heel on the inner side; and the *ʿirq al-nisāʾ*, located at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg, there are three veins like them.  As for the two veins behind the ears, their opening is beneficial for chronic colds, migraines, scabies, and chronic, nasty head sores.  Their opening, as I describe.
This is done by shaving the patient's head and rubbing the back of the head in the location of the veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well.  Then, the patient's neck is constricted with a turban until the veins appear, and their location behind the ears, in the low areas of the head.  Then, you probe them with your finger; and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark it with ink there.
Then take a scalpel, which is known as the *nishal*, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone.  Then lift the arm with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with the skin, a complete severing.  The length of the cut will be the size of two clenched fingers.
Or similar, and release the amount of blood you desire.  Then, tie them with ligatures and leave them until healed.  Their cutting and cauterization were discussed earlier in the book.  As for the arteries in the temples, their opening is beneficial for chronic migraines, severe headaches, chronic conjunctivitis, and acute, intense eye discharge.
Their opening, as I describe to you: the patient's neck is tightened with a turban until the veins are clearly visible and their pulse is apparent beneath your finger. Then, mark the locations with ink.  Then, raise the skin above the vein, pulling it upward with your index finger.
Insert the scalpel (*nishal*) from below, lift the vein upward and sever it as you did with the other veins. Release the blood as needed. Then loosen the patient's neck constriction and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then place a cotton pad and a ligature on it, tying it tightly from above.  Leave it until healed. Their mention, cutting, and releasing were previously discussed in the beginning of the book.  As for opening the forehead vein, its benefit, after opening the temporal vein, is for chronic facial afflictions such as ringworm, sores, and reddish eruptions.
How to open it, as I describe to you: the patient's neck is tightened with a turban until the vein appears. Then, take the instrument called the 'axe' - this is its image:.
Place the pointed prong at the head of the axe on the same vein and strike from above with a mallet or similar instrument. Allow the blood to flow as desired. Then release the patient's neck constriction and tie it tight until healed.
It may also be opened with a wide scalpel, but it should not be a sharp-edged scalpel like other scalpels, rather it should be slightly wide-edged. Open it with a twisting motion, because the bone is nearby, and the scalpel might break if it is thin.
As for the veins located near the eye sockets, their benefit is for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, and eye diseases, and facial illnesses.  As for how to open them, the patient should tighten their neck with a turban, then open them while you are standing over their head.  Open them with a slight twisting motion toward the length using a small, slightly wide scalpel.
If the area has little flesh, if the scalpel is thin, it may break. Then, drain the desired amount of blood, place a compress over them, and tie them up for one night, then loosen them.  Opening the nasal vein is beneficial for acute fevers.
Severe headaches and facial ailments, such as red swelling that appears in the nose, especially if chronic, are treated by opening the vein.  To open the vein, the patient's neck is tightened and the nose is held with your left hand.  A long, thin scalpel is then used.
Insert it into the center of the nostril itself, between the nasal septum, in a straight line, as the vein is not visible there.  Blood will appear immediately.  You should move your hand with the scalpel slightly and drain the desired amount of blood.  Then tie it for a night, as it will clot quickly.
As for the jugular veins, opening them is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and black humoral diseases that appear on the skin's surface, such as black vitiligo, scabies, foul ulcers, and sores.  To open them, the patient's neck is tightened below them with a bandage, and the surgeon stands over the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, and then the vein is opened lengthwise, with a somewhat wide incision.  The moderate amount of blood is drained, or as much as needed.  The same is done to the other vein, then the bandage is loosened.
The two veins are pressed moderately to prevent suffocation of the patient, and left until the next day, when the wound will heal.  As for the veins of the jaw, opening them after opening the temporal vein is beneficial for sores in the mouth, gum disease, foul ulcers, chapped lips, and foul sores.
Those that are in and around the nose.  To open them, have the patient sit before you, tighten their neck with a head cloth, and then turn their lips.  Look for the two veins; one will be visible to the right of the lip, the other to the left, and identify them by their blackness.
Also, around them are small, black veins, so cut them off completely. If you are unsure and do not know which ones they are, then aim to cut the largest and most visible ones.  Do the same for the veins in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, opening them after opening the temporal vein is beneficial for obstructions in the throat caused by sores in the mouth, and mouth diseases.  To open them, have the patient sit before you facing the sun, raise their tongue, and look under the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for a vein. Their color is towards black.
Open them and be cautious; do not cut them deeply, for there are arteries beneath them, and bleeding from these arteries may occur.  The three veins which are opened in the elbow are those customarily opened by people in general, and opening them is done in two ways.
Either by inserting a wide, fragrant, or olive-shaped lancet into the flesh, or by cutting with a scalpel; this is the lancing [and this is its image]. Image of the wide, fragrant lancet:.
It should be wide, as you see, to be suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, visible, thick veins which contain thick, dark blood. This is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:.
This lancet is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for opening thin veins that contain thin, yellowish blood. This is the image of the lancing lancet:.
This lancing instrument, suitable for cutting, comes in various widths and thicknesses, according to the width and narrowness of the veins.  It can be used as a guide for other instruments, and is well-known among artisans.
As for the basilic vein, one of these three veins, its benefit in opening it is that it draws blood from ailments under the neck and throat, leading to the chest and abdomen. The phlebotomist, when opening it, must be cautious and be aware of the position. If an artery is beneath, and the lancet is inserted incorrectly or pushed too far, it will cut that artery.
This will cause blood to gush forth. Therefore, it should not be opened with a lancet for piercing, but rather it should be cut open with a lancing instrument.  If the basilic vein is not clearly visible, one should avoid it, turn to another vein, or search for a branch of it.
Or open the brachial artery, which is obvious, and cut it with the lancing instrument, as we said.  If you wish to open the basilic vein itself, before tightening the arm, you should palpate the location to find the pulse point, then mark it with ink.
Then tie the arm, and cut the vein in a slanted incision with the lancing instrument, as we said, and be careful to keep the incision away from the artery.  Whenever you see swelling at the spot marked with ink when tightening the bandage, this swelling is the pulsating artery; avoid it.
If you see the blood during the venesection spurt like a child's urine, and the blood is thin, red, then know that it is arterial blood.  In that case, quickly place your finger over it for a long time.  Then remove your finger; if the blood stops, it often does, so tighten the arm.
Leave it alone, and warn the patient about neglecting it. Let it be on the neck and do not move it for days until it heals. If the blood does not stop and you are overcome and no medicine is available to you at that time, then sever the artery if it is apparent to you, for its ends will contract and the blood will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell, split it, and take one half and firmly bind it to the vein with a bandage and splints until the next day. If the bleeding stops, then do this; otherwise, treat it with the previously mentioned cauterizing techniques for stopping bleeding. Stopping the blood is not usually difficult in most cases.
Because of the small size of the wound and the effectiveness of the bandage on the arm, know this.  As for the black eye vein, the benefit of its incision is to draw blood from the top of the head and bottom of the body, since it is composed of a branch of the basilar vein and a branch of the jugular vein, as we said.
The surgeon performing the venesection should be careful of the neck, for there are nerves beneath.  If the lancet's insertion deepens and strikes a nerve, numbness will occur, difficult to resolve, and perhaps will not heal at all. This nerve is often perceptible by touch.
If it is concealed in some individuals and delicate, not easily visible, then your incision should be a shallow cut with the lancet.  Avoid the nerve to the best of your ability. If the vein is between two nerves, cut the vein lengthwise. As for the jugular vein, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases.  If you wish to incise this vein, it is best to do so with a slender or broad lancet, for it is the safest vein of all, as there is neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, when performing venesection, you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek the soft spot.  If the first blow does not hit the vein, repeat the venesection several times without harm; however, some people might swell up if it is not done in the first attempt.
But that swelling will not harm them.  As for the method of venesection, its symptoms, and what should be done to correct it, first, you must know that venesection is used either to maintain health alone.
Or it is used for illnesses.  The venesection to maintain health and prevent illness should be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow: the jugular, the ulnar, and the cephalic.  And it should be performed at the beginning of spring, if signs of fullness appear.
Venesection should be done on Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of daylight have passed.  Venesection used for illnesses, however, has no fixed time, but whenever necessity and urgency dictate, whether it be night or day.
At any hour and at any time.  Boys should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, and elderly men who have passed sixty years should not be bled.  If anyone intends to perform venesection for any reason...
He must cleanse his intestines before venesection with a gentle enema, if there is much phlegm accumulated within, so that foul matter from the intestines will not be drawn into the veins during the procedure, harming the vital organs.  Those who are feverish, drunk, or intoxicated should not be bled until these conditions pass.
One should also avoid venesection after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, fatigue, exercise, late nights, fasting, and any physical or mental exertion.  Then, one should look into thinning the humors before if the blood is thick.
By means of food, drinks, and medications if possible.  Then he should bathe, if nothing prevents it, or engage in some exercise to thin the blood.  He should perform venesection in the middle of the day, as we have stated.  He should try to clear his mind of all bad emotional states that day.
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and all physical ailments such as excessive fatigue and exhaustion, sexual activity, and the like.  He should have present at his session the things that people customarily use—fragrances, herbs, entertainments, and the like—for each person according to his ability.
Then the bleeder should sit on a cushion higher than the one the patient sits on, then extend his arm and rub it with his hand two or three times, then tighten the bandage with the tourniquet and twist it two or three times.  The tightening should be moderate.
For if the tightening is not moderate, either excessive tightening will prevent the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it will also prevent the flow of blood.  Then, after tightening, it is necessary for the patient to rub his hands together.
Until the veins swell and become evident to the touch.  Then the bleeder should lightly lubricate the lancet with old oil, especially.  Then he should place his left index finger on the same vein just beneath the spot where he intends to make the incision, slightly, so as not to stray from the vein and miss the intended strike. For some veins are like tendons and recede during the bleeding procedure.  Others are full of air; when the lancet is placed upon them, they sink beneath it, deceiving the bleeder, and the lancet does not open the vein. If it does open it, the opening will be narrow.
Therefore, the bleeder should be firm and careful in all of these things.  Then, he should withdraw the lancet; if the vein has opened on that first try, fine.  Otherwise, he should try again at a slightly lower or higher point, in haste, if the area has not yet swelled up.
If the patient swells or is distressed, leave him alone for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage. For it may cause a hot swelling. He should not enter a bath. Then he can repeat the bleeding if he wishes, if the lancet is inserted and the opening is small and the flow of blood is thin.
Fearing that the desired amount of blood may not be drawn, he should reinsert the lancet into the same puncture, gently, straight, and slightly enlarge the opening.  Do this quickly before the area swells, for in many people, the area may swell up when the opening is small.
If you see that it has swelled, do not return to it at all, for it will not help you. Place some clarified oil on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood, and it is better in this location than the oil itself and other ointments.  Likewise.
Use clarified oil in all your venesections when the flow of blood is difficult.  This remedy may also be done with the *faruq* or *shakhzana*, if one of them is applied to the area; the blood will thin and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of the venesection, which often happens, especially in those who have not been bled before or whose vein opening was small, quickly apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water to the swelling and press it for an hour.  It will dissolve.
This should be done after the blood has completely exited the vein or another vein. If a dark or greenish residue remains after several days, it will not cause harm. If you prefer, apply some dissolved gum arabic and aloes to the area.
Or some of the juice of *fudnj* or the like.  A swelling and protuberance often occurs when bleeding the basilic vein. Apply your hand to it; if you feel it throbbing when you press it, it is a bad protuberance, so be careful not to apply anything we have mentioned.
For it may bleed arterial blood; bandage it with something constricting to firm the area, and then treat it with other remedies until it heals.  One should remove blood from each person in proportion to their strength and the predominant color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it continue to flow until it turns red.  Similarly, if it appears thick, let it flow until it becomes thin.  And if it is sharp, let it flow until the sharpness is gone.  Those who are strong and robust and require a single, complete bloodletting.
One should widen the incision in the vein and make the lancet broad for the strong, but the opposite for the weak.  It should be bled in stages, and the opening should be narrow. The best instrument to use for opening the vein is a curved, slanted cut, not a piercing one.
This type of bleeding is safe from excessive bleeding and from severing a nerve. It is better and safer than transverse or longitudinal bleeding. If fainting occurs during the bleeding, the patient should be given some bread soaked in pomegranate juice or vinegar before the bleeding.
If he is weak and has blood drawn in three or four stages, if he has a cold temperament, let him eat bread soaked in mibe drink, or honey drink scented with perfumes, or a pleasant herbal drink before the bleeding.
If fainting occurs during bleeding, and the cause is excessive blood loss, then the patient should be given meat broth and a delicate herbal drink.  Incense should be used, and the chest should be washed with it.  All the remedies mentioned in the section on fainting in the division should be applied.
If it is due to vomiting, and if someone wants to relieve their arm and bleed them again, for someone whose bleeding was for excessive vomiting and whose strength is weak, the blood should be released little by little, according to strength, over several days.
For someone who wants to relieve their arm and bleed them again, and whose body is strong, let them do so after seven or nine hours from the initial bleeding.  And if someone wants to draw the blood from their body to the opposite side it has leaned towards, then it is necessary to relieve them on the second or third day.
If the body contains a lot of hot, intense blood that has caused a fever, then blood should be drawn in one large amount, extracting a great quantity and widening the opening until fainting occurs, after carefully checking all the conditions of bleeding. And place your hand on his pulse while the blood is flowing, so that death does not occur instead of fainting. This often happens if the bleeder is ignorant and carelessness occurs.  It should not be done if you intend to loosen the arm and bleed again.
If the opening of the vein is closed and the blood is difficult to draw, do not press or twist forcefully.  This is very bad. Instead, either leave it until you bleed it again, or remove any clotted blood in the opening with a scalpel.
Or apply something dissolved in water, like salt, or some antidote like the faruq or shakhznaya, and gently press it until blood comes out. If the vein has swollen, leave it.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides.  If bleeding must be done again, either bleed above that spot or in the other arm, or another vein.
As for bleeding the arm's vein, one bleeds this in place of the akhal and basaliq if these are unavailable or hidden, because it is composed of them.  The procedure for bleeding it is that the patient should put their hand in warm water until the tendon turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible. Then, tie a bandage tightly, but moderately, above it.
Then, bleed the vein slightly to the side, neither up nor down.  Make a wide opening, and bleed just above the wrist joint. If the blood is difficult to draw out, return the arm to the basin of warm water, and allow the blood to flow into the water.
Until you have obtained your needs.  If it is summer, you may dispense with returning the arm to warm water.  More often, you put the arm in warm water during the winter.  Bleeding this vein is safer than all the other veins. Because there is no vein or nerve under it.  Bleeding the vein from the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.  The procedure for bleeding it is to tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand after placing it in warm water until the vein swells.
Because there is no vein or nerve under it.  Bleeding the vein from the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.  The procedure for bleeding it is to tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand after placing it in warm water until the vein swells. It will be clearly visible to the touch.  Then, bleed it slightly to the side.  If you sever it completely, it will cause no harm.  Be careful; do not use the scalpel excessively.  There is a nerve for the fingers under it, and the area is devoid of muscle.  Then, return the arm to warm water.
Leave it [the arm] to continue bleeding. If you do not return it to warm water, the blood will clot in the mouth of the vein and cease to flow.  Once you have extracted the amount of blood needed, apply ointment and salt to the vein so it does not heal quickly.
Similarly, you should do this with every constricted vein.  Bleeding from the left arm is beneficial for ailments of the spleen.  Do the same procedure as you did with the second one.  Bleeding the saphenous vein is beneficial for ailments of the lower body, such as ailments of the uterus.
And for menstrual retention, kidney ailments, chronic sores of the thighs and legs, and similar ailments.  The procedure for bleeding it is to place the leg in warm water and apply massage until the veins are evident.  Then tie above the joint of the leg with a bandage. The vein is located near the heel, visible near the big toe.
Many branches extend from it in the leg.  Bleed it in the widest branch, or at the point where it joins near the heel.  This is better and safer.  If you bleed it in the front of the leg, be careful of the nerves that lie beneath on the front of the leg.
Make your incision with a twisting motion, as if you are trying to sever it. The lancet should be sharp.  If blood is difficult to draw, return the leg to warm water and let the blood flow until it is empty. If the bleeder misses the vein on the first attempt.
Then return to bleeding a little higher up.  The location is safe, no danger is to be feared if you take precautions against the nerve, as we have stated.  Do the same with the saphenous vein of the other leg.  As for the femoral vein, its location is, as we have said, at the heel on the outer side.
Its benefit is for hip pain if it is caused by hot blood. The procedure for bleeding it is that the patient should enter a bath and quickly tighten their leg from the hip to above the heel with a thin, long bandage.  It will only be visible in this way.
If it appears, bleed it in any way, either with a twisting motion (which is best), or sever it, or make an incision.  The location is safe.  It is very hidden in most people, if you do not find it.
If it is not visible at all, bleed some of its branches, which appear on the back of the foot near the pinky and ring fingers.  Take care to avoid the nerves and draw the amount of blood you desire.
Then release the bandage, place a compress on the bleeding site, and bandage the area.  It will quickly heal.
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On Cupping and its Application.
Cupping vessels can be made of horn, wood, brass, or glass.  Cupping can be of two types: one with a scarification and bloodletting, and the other without a scarification.
This type of cupping, without scarification, is of two types.
And the cupping vessels for the "akhadain" (two sides of the neck), the chin (under the lower jaw), shoulders, sacrum (base of the spine), elbows, legs, and heels.
Cupping draws blood from the thin, dispersed veins in the flesh.  Therefore, it does not deplete strength as much as venesection, and cupping, whether with or without fire, should not be used for illnesses due to fullness until the whole body has been emptied.
If cupping is needed due to illness or custom, we use it at any time, at the beginning, end, or middle of the month.
For some people, when blood increases to a point where cupping is needed, they experience heaviness and headaches in their heads. Some have fullness, redness in their face, head, and neck. Others have itching in their face, cheeks, darkness, and clouding in their eyes. Some scratch the area where they were cupped.
Some laugh excessively. Some taste blood in their mouth, gums bleed, and they spit up blood. Some sleep excessively. Some see blood, redness, dead bodies, and wounds in their dreams.  When we observe any of these things...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we order cupping after two or three hours have passed.  The benefit of cupping at the nail-bed is to relieve heaviness in the head and water dripping into the eyes.
However, it is necessary to do this after the entire body has been emptied.  This cupping may be a substitute for venesection of the temples.  One should be cautious about using it on those with a cold head or a cold, as it will greatly harm them.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly, or those with cold diseases in their heads, and those who habitually use it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, the cupper should slightly lower the cupping vessel, for fear of inducing forgetfulness.  Cupping the shoulder is a substitute for venesection of the temple and the forehead.
Therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, chest tightness, coughs, and fullness.  The cupping on the shoulder should be slightly raised, as if placed lower it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping the temples is beneficial for headaches, eye inflammation, migraines, difficulty swallowing, and toothache. It is a substitute for venesection of the forehead.  The cupper should be instructed not to insert the instrument deeply, to avoid severing an artery and causing bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is beneficial for mouth ulcers, gum disease, and similar oral ailments.  It can substitute for venesection of the corners of the lips.  Cupping the shoulders is beneficial for palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
Cupping the forearm's inside, below the elbow, is beneficial for the same reasons as venesection of the three veins: the forehead, temple, and the side of the neck.  Because it draws blood from all the fine veins in the flesh, and draws those fine veins from larger veins, it ultimately draws the blood from the three larger veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to press too hard, as the area is lacking flesh and contains nerves and arteries.  A single cupping on the coccyx is beneficial for hemorrhoids and sores of the lower rectum.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large, copper cup, because the area requires strong suction, and glass cups may break.  Cupping the legs significantly reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the whole body, it is beneficial for chronic kidney, uterine, and bladder ailments. It promotes menstruation and is useful for boils and whitlows.  It is a substitute for venesection of the groins and ankles, though it greatly weakens the body and often causes fainting in most people.  Cupping the ankles is similar in benefit to cupping the legs.
How to apply cupping: First, place the empty cup and apply moderate suction without prolonging the application.  Quickly place and quickly remove the cup to allow the humours to flow evenly to the area.  Repeat this until the area turns red and opens.
When the redness of the blood appears, gently repeat the suction and then observe the patient's condition. In those with delicate, porous flesh, a single marking should suffice to avoid causing an ulcer.
The cupper should widen the mark slightly, deepen it, and apply moderate suction with gentle movement.  If the blood is thick, the mark should be made twice. The first marking opens a path for the thin, watery blood, and the second extracts the thick blood.
If the blood is very murky, the mark should be made a third time to achieve the goal. In short, if a small amount of blood is desired, one marking suffices. If a large amount is desired, more markings are needed, especially if the blood is thick.
The incision should be deep. The moderate limit of the incision is only the depth of the skin.  What ointments and water should be used when applying cupping, and what should the cupper avoid?  For those with thick, hard, dry skin and tight pores...
The areas for cupping should be anointed with softening, dissolving, and opening ointments.  In summer, examples include the ointment of Khirri, violet ointment, sweet almond ointment, or pumpkin seed ointment.
In winter, examples include narcissus ointment, lily ointment, chamomile ointment, or similar hyacinth ointments.  If the excess is thick and cold, the ointment should be of rue, hellebore, frankincense, or fennel seed, or similar.
If the cupper has wide pores and soft flesh, ointment should be avoided.  These individuals should wash their cupping marks after cupping with rosewater, cold water, elderberry water, pumpkin water, or similar.  As for those whose blood is excessively moist...
They should wash their marks with vinegar, or water of rue, sumac, or similar.  As for those whose excess is thick, they should wash their marks with old wine, rue water, fennel or chamomile decoction, or similar.  Cupping should be avoided in the bath and after the bath.
Rather, it should be used one or two hours after leaving the bath.  One should not sleep after cupping.  This is what the cupper and the leeches should consider before and after cupping.
First, one must consider if the cupper or leeches are bilious, with blood dominated by sharpness and inflammation.  They should take cooling foods like pomegranate, dandelion with vinegar, lettuce, barley water, and senna, and use poultry and lamb meat, stewed or roasted, or similar.
And if their temperament is cold, they should be given honeyed drinks, and drinks of dates or a specific type of barley water, and eat moderate, fragrant wine (between old and new).  They should be given little food, and eat poultry, canaries, sparrows, and pigeons, stewed.  On the day of cupping and bloodletting, drinks should be more prevalent than food.
Sometimes, certain individuals may be given antidote, musk medicine, or sheeltha before cupping or bloodletting, or afterward, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood.  This should not be given to those who are feverish.
As for cupping that does not require a specific condition, it is the cupping applied to the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidneys, and groin area, because these organs do not tolerate conditions being placed on them.  Rather, it is intended to draw blood from one organ to another.
As in placing cupping on the breasts in cases of nosebleeds, or to remove a cold wind that has lodged in an organ, such as placing cupping on the abdomen and navel.  This loosens the organ, warms it, and removes the pain by dissolving that wind.
It may be placed on the kidneys if there is a blockage or stones, because its strong suction may open the blockage or remove the stones from their position.  Similarly, it is done when placed on the liver and spleen in the event of wind that affects them.  These cupping applications may be used empty, by suction only.
It may be used with fire, or filled with lukewarm water in cases of swellings.  This is done by filling the cupping vessel, perhaps a large one, with either hot water alone, or water in which certain herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Then it is placed full on the affected area, held, and removed, repeated as needed. This is the method of cupping using fire.
Its mouth opening is two fingers wide, as depicted. Its depth is half a span.  A small hole, just large enough for a needle to enter, is made near the middle of one side.  It is made of thick-rimmed Chinese or yellow brass.
It is smooth, flat, and polished so as not to harm the affected area when placed upon it.  In the center, a crosswise piece of brass or iron is fitted, upon which the candle is placed for heating.  This cupping device can also be made larger or smaller depending on the illness.
Its user must be considered.  Cupping for children and thin individuals is different from cupping for strong, robust adults.  To use this cupping device with fire on the affected area, one should take a tightly wound wick of linen or a small candle made of pitch and place it on the central bar/rod inside the cupping device.
So that the fire rises upward toward the bottom of the cupping device to avoid burning the patient's body.  Then it is placed on the affected area, and the finger is placed on the hole we mentioned, so that when we hold the cupping device, the finger is not needed to be removed.
Steam will then emerge from that hole, and the cupping device will adhere to the affected area.  Then the wick is replenished as needed.  However, cupping devices used for water-based ailments of the "shosh" do not have a fixed rod or hole.
Instead, it is used by filling it with water and placing it directly on the affected area.  This is its image/form.
The larger the cupping device, the better, as it can hold more water.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
On the application of leeches.
Leech application is mainly used on areas where cupping cannot be applied, either because of their small size, like the lips and gums, or because the area is bare of flesh, such as the finger and nose.
To use them, select leeches from clear, unpolluted fresh water, and leave them in fresh water for a day and night to cause them to be hungry and have nothing in their stomachs. Then the body is first emptied by bloodletting or cupping, and then the affected area is cleaned.
Until it turns red, then a leech is placed on it. When full, the leech will drop off.  If the area can be suctioned with a cupping instrument, this is more beneficial. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage and squeeze it. If bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and it is a trickle, then soak a linen cloth in cold water.
Place it over the area until the bleeding stops. If there is excessive bleeding, sprinkle powdered zadj or afsos, or similar coagulants, onto the area until the bleeding stops, or place sliced, peeled half-pods of lentils on the affected area.
Leave it until the lentil adheres to the area, and the bleeding will stop. If the leeches need to be reapplied, use other leeches if possible. If the leeches refuse to attach, then clean the area with fresh blood.
Or, pierce the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then apply a leech. When it senses blood, it will adhere to the spot. If you wish to remove it, sprinkle some dates, salt, or ash on it, and it will detach from the spot.
Chapter Three.
On Fractures.
This chapter also, of the matters essential for the practice of medicine, is on the setting of fractures and dislocations of bones.
Know, my children, that many ignorant physicians and laypeople, who have never studied the books of the ancients or read a single letter from them, may claim expertise in this chapter.
For this reason, this branch of knowledge has become extinct in our land, and I have never encountered a single practitioner who excelled in it. I have gained from it only what I have gained through extensive study of the books of the ancients and my diligence in understanding them, and then through consistent practice and training throughout my life.
I have outlined for you in this chapter everything that my knowledge encompasses. My experience has been applied to it, after presenting it to you, removing the superfluous verbiage, condensing it to the utmost brevity, and elucidating it fully.  Numerous images of the instruments used in it are also depicted.
This is to further elucidate the subject, as I did in the preceding chapters.  There is no power except with God, the Most High, the Great.
Chapter One.
It contains summaries and essentials concerning the breaking of bones, which must be presented first.  Before we begin to describe fractured and dislocated members individually, it is necessary to mention certain points and chapters in the introduction to this section. This will first necessitate your understanding and grasping their true nature, both for yourselves and anyone else who is eager to learn this noble craft.
So I say that whenever a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall occurs, one must first hasten to reduce the swelling or loosen the tension, or both. Unless prevented by something like weakness of strength, or if the affected person was a child or an old man, or if the weather was extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then, his diet should consist of cold legumes, poultry, and hare, and he should be forbidden from drinking, thick meats, and overeating, and any food that fills the veins with blood, until the swelling subsides and you are sure no more fluid is flowing to the area.
Then, the patient should return to his initial regimen, as he was accustomed.  If the fractured bone begins to knit, the patient should eat foods that provide substantial, thick, strong nourishment, having viscosity, such as barley, rice, heads of grain, and ox tripe. Eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and similar things.  By this regimen, the fracture will knit more quickly and better.  Know that fractured bones in strong men and the elderly will not always reconnect and heal to their original condition.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, and sometimes the bones, especially those as soft as those of young children, may connect and knit.  But nature creates around the fractured bone a substance resembling glue, thick and tenacious, adhering to and holding it together until the parts are firm.
Connecting them until they attain their original strength and firmness, so that nothing hinders their function.
Therefore, the patient's diet should consist of foods with strength, viscosity, and thickness, as we have stated.  Know that the types of fractures differ according to the affected limb, for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head, and a fracture of the chest differs from one of the back.
And so too, all other limbs differ from one another.  We will describe each type of fracture in detail in its own section, and the type of fracture of a bone itself can vary.
Because a fracture may be a simple break without splinters, or it may be lengthwise with splinters, detached or not detached fragments.  The fracture may be accompanied by a wound and tearing of the skin, or it may be a slight crack.
Each type has a specific method of treatment, as will be explained in detail in its place.  Signs of a bone fracture include its crookedness, its prominence, the sensation of it, and its creaking when you touch it with your hand.
If there is no visible distortion, no creaking, and no discomfort or pain when you feel the bone, then there is no fracture; it may be a strain, a slight fracture, or a minor crack.  Under no circumstances should you move it by pulling or probing.
Instead, apply the appropriate medications, which will be discussed later, to the affected area, and apply a gentle bandage.  Understand that if the bone is fractured and splintered but no fragments are detached, each part has still moved from its original position.
Therefore, you should promptly realign and straighten it before any inflammation occurs.  If inflammation does occur, leave it for a few days until it subsides, and then straighten it with any gentle method you can employ.
Know that straightening a fracture is easier than one with fragments.  The subsequent bandaging will be discussed later.  If the bone has splinters, you must extend the fractured limb (arm or leg) in both directions.
Either by hand if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with both ropes and hand.  Position the limb on a flat surface in its natural shape.  Once the broken bone has been extended, then carefully return the protruding parts to their proper positions using any method you can devise, with gentleness.
Strive with all your effort not to cause pain or suffering to the patient.  Do your utmost to bring the two fractured bone ends together in the best possible position.  At that time, you should touch and feel them with your hand. If you find anything amiss, correct and adjust it to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive stretching and forceful prodding, as many ignorant practitioners do.  Often, such actions produce inflammation or swelling in the limb, as I have repeatedly observed.
After aligning, fixing, and bandaging the limb, keep it completely still and quiet. Warn the patient not to move it during wakefulness, sleep, turning over, restlessness, bowel movements, or any other activity to the greatest extent possible.  Ensure that the limb's position is one that avoids pain.
If the patient feels pain or discomfort in any position, move the limb to a position that is painless.  Furthermore, ensure that the new position is straight and aligned.
So that no crookedness results in the limb after it has been set.  Regarding how to bandage a fractured limb, as I describe, be aware that fractured limbs vary in size, shape, and condition.  Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and similar parts, ...
The bandages for the smaller limbs, like the arms and fingers, should be soft and gentle.  However, for larger limbs like the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages must be firm and strong.  A broad bandage is necessary for a larger limb, holding it firmly from all sides with an even tension, free from any irregularities.
Then, after completing the alignment, apply the appropriate plaster. Gently bend the limb at the fracture site.  Then, begin wrapping the bandage three or four times around the fracture site, depending on the limb's requirements.  Slightly tighten the bandage, then move it upwards from the fracture point.
Tighten the bandage less than you did for the fractured area.  Then, move the wrapping slightly away from the fracture site, loosening the tension gradually until a good alignment of the limb is achieved.  Then, take another bandage and wrap it around the fracture area as well.
Wrap further, moving the bandage downwards from the fracture.  Maintain the tension and looseness described in the initial wrapping (the upper part).  Place soft padding or linen between the layers of bandages, aligning any misalignment of the fracture.
If there is any misalignment, do not add anything.  Then wrap another bandage around it.  Apply firm splints over these bandages if there is no swelling or inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or inflammation, apply something to reduce the swelling and inflammation. Leave it for a few days, then apply splints. The splints should be made from wide, cut reeds or from sieve wood, prepared thoughtfully.
Made from pine, palm leaves, rushes, or similar readily available materials.  The size of each splint should be the same.
However, the splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others. The length of the splint should be appropriate for the size of the fractured limb. Image of the splint:.
Then bind the splints with another bandage, the same way as the first.  Then tie securely from above with strong threads, ensuring the bandage is tighter over the fracture site. The tighter the bandage, the closer to the fracture.
The threads should be of medium thickness and not too thin.  Use damp linen threads, specifically, because thick threads, like those used by ignorant practitioners made from twisted linen strips, are a grave error.
Because the tension with them is out of balance.  Thin threads are also unsuitable, as you cannot achieve the desired tension.  The distance between the splints should not be less than a finger's breadth.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after applying the correct tension, place soft padding, such as soft wool, underneath to avoid any discomfort.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and the skin is broken, we will discuss this separately.
Know that not every fractured limb needs to be splinted from the first day. If the limb is large, splints should not be applied until five, seven, or more days later, depending on your assurance that inflammation will not occur.
This is a description of the dressings used by the ancients to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  It is a concise, common dressing that sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, as it is neither excessively hot nor cold.
Take flour dust, the residue that clings to the millstones during grinding. Knead it as it is, without sifting with egg white, making it neither thick nor thin, and then bake it.
Another dressing for fractures, dislocations, and sprains. Take ten dirhams each of mastic, frankincense, acacia, raisin, and myrrh. Five dirhams each of tragacanth and dates, and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Roman clay. Grind all of these ingredients and mix them with acacia water, or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot.  This dressing, well-composed, sets broken bones quickly and is suitable for most people due to its balanced nature.
Another dressing useful for fractures and sprains: take ten dirhams each of myrrh, mastic, and white hellebore; five dirhams each of tragacanth and dates; six dirhams of acacia; and twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind all thoroughly, sift, and knead with water or egg white, then apply.
A dressing for joints and dislocated bones, to relieve pain and for skull fractures and broken bones.  Take prepared wool, dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply to the affected area. This dressing does not have the power to set the bones.
However, it is excellent for relieving hot swelling and pain, particularly. Another dressing to set a broken bone: take leaves of the fig tree and the wild poppy, grind them both, and apply as a poultice. Another brief dressing for the splintering of a bone fracture.
If you wish to treat the remaining swelling, take roots of hellebore, chamomile, violet, and poppy seed, in equal parts. Grind everything together and knead with ointment if the limb is not inflamed.  If it is inflamed, knead with coriander water or water and apply.
Another stronger dressing for resolving than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs with splintered bone: take the root of hellebore, linseed, fenugreek, balm, marjoram, violet, and chamomile, in equal parts.
Grind everything together and knead with vinegar water, or fresh water, or ointment, all according to the heat of the limb and the subsidence of its heat.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that this should be applied to a broken limb during its setting.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil only, described as being medium in consistency between thick and thin.  As for Galen, he believed that things with dryness and some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and similar substances, should be applied to the broken limb during its setting.
A dressing for weakness and pain: take willow bark, chickpeas, human hair (or bird feather), hellebore, and salt, in equal parts. Grind, sieve, knead, and apply as a dressing.  As for the amount of ligament that should remain...
Then it should be removed.  If the patient is not experiencing pain, irritation, or the displaced bone has not moved from its position, it should not be removed for many days. However, if severe irritation, persistent pain, or swelling occur in the area, remove it.
Then quickly remove it immediately and do not delay.  Remove the dressing, then take a soft cloth or damp sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the irritation and pain subside. Then allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Then apply softened wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bandage it overnight until the hot swelling subsides, the limb's puffiness diminishes, and the pain is relieved. Then, gently reapply a light bandage, but do not apply the original tight bandage.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and puffiness, and all symptoms have completely disappeared, and you need a bandage and support, reapply it as you did initially.  If none of these mentioned things occur in the limb,
Then do not remove it until after three, four, five, or seven days.  Sometimes it may be left for twenty days, all according to how the limb appears to you, as we have said, until the fracture is healed and the flesh around it has begun to knit together.
Increase the pressure of the bandage even more than your first application, and increase the patient's nutrition as previously mentioned. If you see that the fracture site has dried up and become emaciated more than is appropriate, then know that nutrition is not reaching it.
Unwrap it with lukewarm water each time you remove it, and do this every three days.  Slightly reduce the pressure of the bandage.  By doing this, you will allow nourishment to flow to the limb, and it will heal quickly.  As for what the ignorant among the fixers do, to fracture the limb again,
If it was not initially set correctly, and is set crooked, that is an error on their part and a great deception.  If it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it.  I have not seen any evidence of it from any of them at all. The correct approach is not to use it.
The Second Chapter.
Concerning fractures occurring in the head.
Fractures of the head are numerous, their forms varied, and their causes diverse. Some fractures are caused by sword blows, and these may involve the complete separation of the bone until it reaches the peritoneum beneath the bone. As is done with wood by carpenters.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a carpenter's fracture.  Alternatively, the sword may have cut a portion of the bone, fracturing only one surface, without penetrating all the way through. This type of fracture is called a simple fracture.  The wound resulting from these fractures may be either large or small.
Some fractures are caused by a blow from a stone, or a fall on a stone or similar object, and are either contusions or lacerations.  This fracture may either penetrate nearly to the membrane beneath the bone or involve only the surface of the bone.
The wounds from these fractures may also be either large or small.  Some fractures are hidden within the bone, a slight fissure.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.  A fracture can also be caused by a fall or a blow with a stone, or similar object, whereby a section of the bone is driven inwards, causing the affected area to become concave, as happens to a copper object when struck, a portion of which is driven inwards.
This is most often seen in the soft, bony heads of children. All these types of fractures may have detached or non-detached fragments. We will discuss the treatment of each in its place, and identify all these types of fractures through examination.
Inspecting them with probes and removing any corrupted flesh.  A hairline fracture is recognized by examining the bone, rubbing and staining it with ink, for the fracture will appear black.  As for the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms.
If you see apparent symptoms of danger, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is almost inevitable with these symptoms.
However, if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and hope for his recovery, then begin treatment. This is if the injured person comes to you in the first few days, and this is during winter.
You should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, in any case. If it is during the summer, you should remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue beneath the bone deteriorates and those symptoms we described appear.
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is crushing and bruising, you should remove the crushed and bruised part, as I describe to you: shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way possible, according to the nature of the wound and the patient's comfort.  If, during the exposure of the bone, you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling, treat it appropriately.
This involves packing the area with cloths dipped in rosewater and ointment, and cleaning the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding stops. Then, begin to reposition and extract the bone, using one of two methods of operation.
One method is to cut the bone with a thin, narrow incision.  This is its representation:
Then, use another incision slightly wider than the first.  This is its representation:
Then use yet another incision, wider than the second.  It is important that you have several different incisions, some wider than others, and some shorter than others.  Their edges should be extremely sharp.  Use Indian iron or good steel for these.
Use gentleness when striking the incision, lest you dislodge the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and firm, you should perforate around it before using the incisions, with the drills called "non-immersed" drills.
Because they do not exceed the limit of the skull bone, beyond it. For the drill has a rounded edge below its sharp head, similar to a ring or small circle, preventing it from penetrating and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that for each skull, you have a drill whose sharp tip is the right length and width for the thickness of that skull.  Here are three types. Of drills, large, medium, and small.
As for how to perforate around the fractured bone, place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone has been pierced. Then move the drill to another location, making a space between each perforation about the thickness of a lead rod, or similar.
Then cut with the forceps the area between each two perforations, doing this with as much gentleness as possible, as we said, until you remove the bone either by hand or with another instrument of the tools that were prepared for that purpose.
Like the small saws and tweezers.  You must be extremely careful not to touch the peritoneum with the drill or forceps. If you have perforated the bone and detached it from the peritoneum if it was stuck to it, and you have removed it, then it should be cleaned.
And smooth any roughness remaining on the bone with another instrument similar to the forceps, but it should be finer and gentler than other forceps.  If any small bones or fragments remain, carefully remove them with the instruments you have.
Then treat the wound afterward with the compresses and ointments that will be mentioned.  The other approach to treatment is quite straightforward and free of risk, as Galen described and highly praised.  This is what he said. First, you should begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and prominent. Once you have exposed that part, place the tip of this lenticular forceps underneath it.  This is its image.
The lenticular portion of it should be smooth, not cutting anything, and the sharp portion of it should have its pointed edges extending lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular portion rests against the peritoneum and the sharp edge of the forceps is against the bone. Then strike the forceps on one side.
With a small hammer, so as to break all the bone gently, as it turns.  And you are safe from injuring the membrane;  absolutely no frightful accident occurs, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were asleep.
If anything of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some areas, scrape it off with the tip of the lenticular forceps itself, and remove it gently.  It will come off without harm or fear.
If the fracture of the bone did not reach the membrane, and the broken part of the bone was its surface, with roughness and small fragments remaining, then you should remove those roughnesses and fragments using small, various-sized instruments, so that you can use the one best suited for each area, as the work directs you.
The fractured bone itself and its shape should be considered.  First, use the widest of the instruments for scraping the bone, then use a narrower one, and continue to do so progressively using the narrowest and finest of them all.
As for the other small, hairline cracks and delicate fractures, each should be treated according to what will bring it about.  This is something evident to those with the slightest skill in this craft and have studied what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound's opening.  Then take another cloth, folded or triangular. Soak it in rose water and oil, and place it on top of the first cloth.  Do this with the lightest possible touch, so as not to weigh down the peritoneum. Then use a wide bandage on top, and tighten it only as much as is needed to hold the wound closed.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two, until the hot swelling subsides.  Then, remove the bandage and use afterwards the drying remedies, such as iris root, carob flour, kender powder, and zarraund, and similar ones. Make poultices from these remedies.
Dust the wound with these dry remedies.  In general, use a remedy that cleanses but does not sting.  Strive, throughout your treatment, for the wound to be clean, without grease, dirt, or pus buildup.
For if pus accumulates on the membranes of the brain, it corrupts and putrifies it, causing the afflicted great harm, and it may also occur in the membranes of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If a dark discoloration appears on its surface, and the patient presents the symptoms we mentioned, know that he is inevitably doomed.  And if the discoloration is due to a medication applied to it, and the medication had the power to cause such a discoloration.
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them thoroughly, and apply them with a cloth to the membranes.  Then treat it with the necessary remedies until it is healed.
Chapter Three.
In the setting of a fractured nose.
Know that only the upper portions of the nose, or one of them, can fracture, since they are bones.  The lower portion is cartilaginous, and cannot fracture, but may experience contusions, deviation, or perforation.
If one of the nasal bones is fractured, you should insert the little finger into the nostril and align the fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose is restored to its natural shape.  Be gentle in your actions, and ensure that this does not cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is in the upper nose and your finger cannot reach it, a slightly thickened probe should be used to align it. If the fracture is in both sides, do the same.  One should attempt reduction on the first day following the fracture.
If possible, or else after the seventh or tenth day, when the acute swelling has subsided, insert a wick of linen thread into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or two wicks if the fracture is on both sides.
The wick should be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some early setters of fractures recommended soaking the wick in ghee and changing it every day.  I, however, do not believe that is necessary, and instead recommend soaking the wick in beaten egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the wick until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens.  Goose-feather tubes, wrapped in soft linen, may be inserted into the nostril where the wick was placed.  This will provide a firmer hold for the fracture of the nose and prevent difficulty in breathing for the patient.
This is not essential; you may perform either procedure.  If a hot swelling develops on the nose during your work, bandage it with a linen cloth or with cotton soaked in vinegar and rose ointment or a preparation of diachylon.
If no hot swelling appears, you should bandage the outside with fine semolina and ground kandar mixed with egg white.  Then place a soft bandage over it.  Do not bind the nose at all, if the nasal bones are fractured in small pieces.
Or if it is fragmented, you should split it open and remove it with the appropriate instrument. Then stitch the split and treat it with ointments that promote healing and suppuration. If a wound occurs inside the nose, you should treat it with a wick and use lead tubes. Until it heals.
Fourth Chapter.
On setting a fractured lower jaw.
If the lower jaw is fractured but not accompanied by an open wound, and the fracture is only external, not fractured in two places, and does not curve inward, then its diagnosis is easy.
If the fracture is on the right side, the index finger of the left hand should be inserted into the patient's mouth.  Likewise, if the fracture is on the left side, the index finger of the right hand should be inserted and gently lift the hump of the fracture from the inside to the outside.
With your other hand outside the bone, you control its alignment.  If the jaw fracture has broken into two pieces, then traction must be applied from both sides in a straight line to allow its alignment. If it has occurred in the teeth, it should be treated with care.
Or if it has separated, tie together what you hope to keep together with a gold, silver, or silk thread.  Then, place a splint over the fractured jaw, then place a folded cloth over that, and over the cloth, place a large, tight bandage or a piece of leather, the same length as the jaw. Then tie it from above in the way that seems suitable to you for its closure, so that it does not become displaced.  Instruct the patient to rest and refrain from movement, and provide him with soft, digestible food.  If you suspect a change in shape has occurred in any way, begin to untie it on the third day.
Then tie it from above in the way that seems suitable to you for its closure, so that it does not become displaced.  Instruct the patient to rest and refrain from movement, and provide him with soft, digestible food.  If you suspect a change in shape has occurred in any way, begin to untie it on the third day. Then, repair what you have bandaged with flour dust and egg white, or with semolina flour, after removing the splint.  Place a soft compress over the dressing.  As long as the dressing adheres to the wound and the bone condition has not changed, leave it in place.
Do not remove it until the fracture heals and strengthens.  This fracture often strengthens within three weeks. If, during that time, a hot swelling appears, use the methods we have mentioned repeatedly to calm it until it subsides.
Now, if the fracture is accompanied by an open wound, if any bone fragment or fragments have separated from the bone, gently remove them with the appropriate instruments. If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a forceps as needed.
Then, if you have removed all the fragments, close the wound opening if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the suitable ointments. And heal the wound until it is healed.
Fifth chapter.
On the setting of the clavicle if fractured.
The clavicle is most frequently fractured from the front, from the acromial end.  Its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it fractures and splinters into two pieces without creating fragments, which is the easiest to set.
Or the fracture may involve fragments, which is more difficult to set.  Or the fracture may be accompanied by a wound.  If the fracture is without a wound, have two assistants; one should hold the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, and the other should extend the neck toward the opposite side.
Then align the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct and there is neither a protuberance nor a displacement.  If further extension is required, a ball of linen or wool should be placed under the patient's armpit.
Adjust the bone according to your needs and extend and raise the clavicle, and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you cannot pull the clavicle outward because it has sunk inwards, the patient should lie on their back.
A moderate-sized pillow is placed under the patient's shoulder, and the assistant presses the shoulder downward until the sunken clavicle rises.  Then, correct and align the fracture with your fingers.
If you sense that a fragment of the clavicle has broken off and is moving, you should carefully separate and remove that fragment. If the fragment is embedded in the bone, attempt to remove it using one of the instruments prepared for this purpose. After placing the instrument that protects the pleura (made of wood or iron) under the clavicle, this is its image:.
It resembles a spoon with no curvature. Its width should be adjusted according to the size of the bone, and its length also according to what you need for the procedure.  Let it have two ends, one wider and the other narrower, as you see.
If the wound created during the removal of the bone fragment is wide and you fear inflammation, stitch the edges of the wound together. If the wound is small or you fear serious inflammation, close the wound using sutures and splints appropriate to the size of the cut.
If a hot inflammation occurs, soak the dressings in rose-water and vinegar or broth and apply them.  If the bone is fractured without a wound or incision, apply a bandage made of flour dust and egg white to the bone. Place a soft splint on it, then place a ball under his armpit if needed.  Then, take a bandage very long, about a span or so in width. Then, place a folded splint over the splint and bandage.  Then, take a splint made of thin wood. Make its width three fingers and its length the same. Then insert it into a cloth. Then insert that cloth with the splint into the part of the bandage that is over the fracture site. Then, tie the bandage around the fracture as you would wrap. Support it around his neck and under his healthy armpit and under his affected armpit, and reposition it repeatedly on each side.  And how you see that the bandage secures the fracture firmly, is something you should know.
The whole point is that the splint should not move from the fractured bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day. Whenever the ligaments relax and you see the splint has moved, correct it and tighten the bandage. Then, have the patient sleep on their back and place a small pillow under their armpit at night.
To raise his arm away from his side, so that the fractured collarbone rises with the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck.  Do not loosen the bandage unless a wound or swelling occurs in the area within twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason to do so. Tighten the bandage and leave it until the fractured collarbone is set and consolidated.  The fracture will strengthen and become more solid within twenty-eight days. And it may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
On setting a fractured shoulder.  The shoulder rarely fractures at its broad part; rather, its bones fracture. When a part or the middle of it breaks, this is determined by palpation.  Depending on the nature of the fracture, make an appropriate mold.
Bring it back to its natural shape by every possible means, then apply mill dust mixed with egg white and soft linen. Place a folded cloth over this, then put a wide splint made of wood over it.
Make the splint as wide as the entire shoulder, or slightly wider. If there is a depression under the splint at any point on the shoulder, smooth it out with soft linen until the splint lies flat. Then bind with a long bandage from above.
Bind firmly, securing the splint so it does not shift. Examine the bandage daily. If the bandage loosens, tighten it and readjust the splint if it shifts. The patient should lie on their sound side, and the shoulder will be set within twenty days.
For a period of one or twenty-five days.  Once this time has passed, remove the bandage; you are safe, as it is one of the bones where shattering or displacement is not feared.  If a piece of bone protrudes and is piercing the skin, cut over it and remove it. Do what I have described for a fractured collarbone regarding the treatment of a hot swelling if such a thing occurs.
Chapter Seven.
For the setting of a fractured rib.
The chest can fracture in the middle, but this is rare.  Its extremities are more prone to fracturing and splintering.  If the middle fractures, symptoms include a downward tilt, severe pain, shortness of breath, and coughing.
Sometimes blood may be coughed up, and the depression in the fractured bone will be evident and palpable.  To set it, the patient should lie on their back with a pillow between their shoulders.  Then, their sides should be pressed and the ribs brought together by hand, smoothing them out from all sides where possible.
Maintain this until the bone returns to its proper shape. Then, apply bandages and splints, placing a light splint of thin poplar or willow wood, or similar material, over it after wrapping it in cloth. Then carefully bind it to the fractured bone so it doesn't shift, wrapping the bandage around the back several times, tightening it securely.  The bandage should be checked frequently, and tightened whenever it loosens.
If the affected area develops sores, pain, or swelling, then remove the bandage and treat the problem.  If appropriate, replace the bandage. Apply medication and maintain the compression until healed.
Chapter Eight.
In the setting of fractured ribs, know that fractures typically occur in the thick parts of the ribs near the spine and along their front edges.  This is because they are cartilaginous.  This fact will not be hidden from the touch when examining with fingers.
Reduce the fracture with your fingers to restore the proper shape.  Then bandage and secure the fractured bone with a splint if necessary.  If the fractured ribs are angled inward, the patient will experience severe pain.
And the pain is like the pain of a person with a ruptured spleen, because the bone pierces the diaphragm and also causes difficulty breathing, coughing, and copious spitting of blood. This is a difficult condition to treat, and the ancients employed many methods to address it.
Some have said that the patient's diet should include foods that produce flatulence and wind, to inflate the abdomen and push the fracture outward.  We oppose this, lest it worsen inflammation.  If inflammation hasn't occurred, it will not.  But if it has, this will exacerbate and confirm it.
Some said a cupping device should be applied to the area and suctioned forcefully.  While this is plausible, there's concern that the cupping will unduly draw to the weakened area. Others said the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
A cushion is placed between the ribs until the space is full, and the ligaments will be aligned if wrapped around in a circular manner.  Then treat the patient as for a spleen rupture, using diet and medication. If the patient is in extreme distress, he cannot endure it. The bone was piercing the diaphragm painfully, and we feared for the patient.  Therefore, it is necessary to cut open the affected area, expose the fractured rib, place the device described earlier that protects the peritoneum beneath it, and gently remove the bone.
Then, if the wound is large, we suture the edges and treat it with ointments until it heals.  If a hot abscess arises during this process, quickly apply rose-scented linen compresses to the area and treat the patient internally with remedies to reduce the inflammation.
He should lie on the side on which he sleeps more comfortably until healed.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if they are fractured, this rarely occurs.  More often, there is contusion.  Likewise, the vertebrae of the back are also more commonly contused. If this happens to someone, and you wish to determine whether they will heal, or not. If you observe that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and lifeless, and he cannot move, extend, or clench them; and if you pinch or prick them with a needle, he feels no sensation or pain, then know that in most cases he will not recover; he is doomed.
But if he moves them and feels the pinch and the prick, then know that the spinal marrow has been spared, and the patient will recover with treatment.  If a similar condition affects the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether he will also recover or not...
Then examine his legs. If you see that they have become relaxed, and the same condition as in the hands has occurred, and if when he lies on his back, wind and stool come out involuntarily, and if when he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily... And if, lying on his back, he attempts to urinate, but cannot, know that he is doomed.  Do not concern yourself with treating him. If none of this occurs, the matter is less serious. The treatment for what has occurred is to try to relieve the inflamed swelling.
By applying rose oil, alone or with roasted egg yolks, to the affected vertebrae three times a day, until the inflamed swelling subsides. Then, apply one of the strengthening, absorbent dressings to the area, and bind it tightly with a bandage.  Instruct him to rest and remain still.
He should sleep only on the side where he does not experience pain, until he is healed. If a fracture or something else has resulted from the injury to the bone, that has since healed, it is necessary to cut through the skin and remove that piece of bone. Then, if the wound is large, bring the edges together with stitches.  Then treat it with healing ointments until healed. If another bone of the coccyx (tailbone) has broken, then insert the little finger of the left hand into the anus.
Align the broken bone with the other hand as best as possible.  Then, apply a dressing and splint if necessary, and bind it tightly.
If you feel a fractured piece inside it, cut open the area and remove it. Treat the wound with the previously mentioned treatments until healed.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Hip bones rarely fracture.  If they do, the fracture is usually a splintering at the ends and a lengthwise splitting, tilting inwards.  The patient experiences pain, throbbing, and numbness in the affected leg.
To set it, you should place your hand over the fracture and assess its appearance. If the fracture is only at the ends, reshape the broken ends to their natural form.
If the fracture is lengthwise, or if it has tilted inwards, lay the patient on their stomach to facilitate setting the fracture.  After you have straightened it, apply bandages, then a splint of wood or leather, and bind firmly.
Do not fear the fracture shifting or the splint coming loose.  Fill in any hollows around the hips to achieve even pressure. Tell the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side if a hot swelling appears.
Refrain from further manipulation and setting until the hot swelling subsides. Apply remedies to reduce it as previously described. Then resume the setting and binding as necessary. If fragments or splinters of bone appear at the ends, they should not be removed.
Do not touch it, but rather adjust it from the outside, as we said, and maintain the binding until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On setting a fractured humerus.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder. If it fractures, set it using one of two methods. One method is to take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness, shaped like this:
Tie straps to its ends, then suspend it from a high point. The patient sits in a chair, then places their fractured arm on the stick so their armpit is positioned in the middle of the stick's curve. Then a heavy object is suspended from above.
Or a servant extends it downwards, then the physician straightens the fracture with their hands until the fracture is restored to its proper position. The other method is for the patient to lie on their back, and their arm is suspended from their neck with a strap.
Then instruct two servants, one to hold the portion above the fracture in their hands, and the other to hold the portion below, and each of them should pull in their respective direction.  If you want a stronger pull, tie a strap under the fracture and another above, and have each servant pull in their respective direction.
If the fracture is near the shoulder, the strap should be positioned under the armpit and the other strap under the fracture toward the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, the strap should be positioned at that spot and at the elbow itself.
Then the fracture is gently straightened without force, until the fracture is properly aligned and joined together well. Then it is tightened, unless a hot swelling appears. If a hot swelling does appear, postpone tightening until the seventh day. Apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil to it.
Until the swelling subsides, then tighten it.  The method of tightening is to place the bandage on the fracture, then place a fresh cloth wrap on the bandage, then bring the arm to the upper arm itself, and place the hand open on the shoulder.
And hold the cloths and the tightening on the upper arm and forearm so that the arm serves as a splint, if nothing prevents you from doing so and nothing of the fractured bone has changed. If you fear that something of the broken bone may change, then use splints.
It is to place a splint on the fracture itself, wider and stronger than other splints.  Let there be a finger's width between each splint.  Let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, with an extra three fingers on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tightening described in the first chapter.
It is that your tightening should be strongest at the fracture site.
And the further from the fracture, the less the tightening. If you see the placement of splints and tightening as we said when you set the limb, do as we have stated.
And if you fear inflammation, leave the tightening and splints until the seventh day, as we said.  Then examine the ligament every three days, so that there is no itching or puffiness in the area, or that food cannot reach the limb due to excessive tightening.  All of this is corrected according to what we have mentioned.
If you are certain that none of this will happen, do not loosen the bandage until many days later.  The patient should lie on their back, hand on stomach, and a filled, moderate-sized piece of wool should be placed under the arm.
Examine at all times, night or day, so that the shape of the fractured limb does not change, or the bandage does not loosen.  Correct all of this with your efforts, and make the patient's food as we previously stated, initially gentle, so that when the bone is about to strengthen.
Then the food should be thickened.  It is customary for the arm and leg to strengthen in forty days.  Then the bandage should be loosened, and baths should be used, and treatments with ointments appropriate for this should be applied, if the fracture is severe and displaced.
Do not remove the bandage until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called radii. One is small, and it is the one next to the thumb; the other is large, and it is positioned under the smaller one, below.  Possibly only the larger radius is fractured, or only the smaller one, or possibly both are fractured.
If the upper smaller radius is fractured, then its setting is easier and its healing is quicker. If the lower radius is fractured, the fracture is poor and its healing is difficult. The worst case is when both bones are fractured. If the fractured bone is the upper smaller radius.
Therefore, when setting it, the physician should make the traction gentle and slight until it is aligned. If the larger radius is fractured, the traction should be stronger. If both radii are fractured, the traction should be very strong.
The hand should be positioned during setting and traction, extended on a cushion. The thumb should be positioned higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the rest of the fingers. The patient should sit upright.
The cushion should be at his height so that the patient does not experience strain.
Then, a servant stretches the arm from below, either with his hand or a bandage, and another servant stretches from above.  Then the physician aligns the bone, returning it to the best possible shape.  If the fracture contains fragments, they are reduced.
Reduce every fragment to its place.  If a fragment protrudes, piercing the skin, and you have no hope of setting it, incise over it and remove it by the method mentioned previously.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate section is devoted to it.
Take treatment for that from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your setting, apply a bandage soaked in rose-oil ointment and white wax; let it be of medium thickness, and apply it gently until the swelling subsides.
Remove the bandage, and apply a dressing prepared from mill dust and egg white. Then apply splints. The splint placed directly on the fracture should be wider and stronger.  Know that in most cases, the arm requires six splints.
The fracture may be in one radius or both radii.  Then make your traction stronger at the site of the fracture.  As you pull upward or downward, gradually decrease the traction, as previously mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.
Let the bandages wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, not overly stiff.  Let the thread used for traction be made of fine linen, of medium thickness as described.  Inspect the limb and ligaments after several days.
If any problem arises, such as an irritation appearing on the limb, then the limb should be washed with warm water until the irritation subsides.  Leave the limb untied for a night to rest, then resume the traction.
If the traction has become too loose, and the bone has shifted or similar problems arise, correct all of it to your best ability. Also, if the limb is not receiving nourishment due to excessive traction, then loosen it slightly and leave it for several days to allow nourishment to reach it, then tighten it again.
If none of the problems mentioned above occur, the splint should not be removed until approximately twenty days have passed.  Then suspend the patient's arm from their neck, keeping the arm straight.  The patient must avoid strenuous movements and sleep on their back.
Know that this arm fracture will be set within thirty days, or thirty-two, or perhaps twenty-eight days, all depending on the patient's constitution and strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On setting fractures of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpals of the hand and the phalanges of the fingers rarely fracture; they are more often injured by contusions.  Therefore, when the hand is fractured or contused...
The patient should sit in a squat position, with a chair in front of him at the same level.
Then, he places his hand on the chair, outstretched.  Then the bone-setter extends the fractured bones and straightens them.  The physician should, once a good alignment is achieved, apply dressings and splints if no hot swelling occurs.  Then, a splint should be placed over the area, as needed.
It should be wrapped in soft cloth. If the fracture is on the underside of the palm, make a ball shape from cloth.  Tell the patient to hold it with their injured hand.  Then, tie it with a long strip of cloth.
Let the splint be made of soft leather, so the skin can heal with flexion of the whole hand. Tie it tightly as required. If the fracture is on the outside, a splint should be placed above and another below the hand, keeping the hand open and upright.
Then, the splint should be tightened as the hand rotates and tied between the fingers using bandages. If the fracture is in one of the fingers, if it's the thumb, it should be straightened and then tied with the hand.  If desired, a small, separate splint can be placed to support the fractured bone.
Do not move it. If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, ring, or pinky, straighten them and tie them to the healthy adjacent finger, or tie them all together to keep them aligned— this is best— or place a small, separate splint on them.
As we said for the thumb, and check during and after the setting of the fracture, and counteract any inflammation as described repeatedly.
Chapter Fourteen.
On setting a fractured thigh.
The thighbone frequently breaks and is readily apparent to the touch because it moves back and forth.  Setting it involves tying a bandage above the fracture and another below the fracture, with the patient lying on their face.
Then, each attendant should pull the bandage taut on its side, ensuring alignment if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.  If the fracture is near the hip, a soft bandage, either of wool or similar material, should be used.
If the fracture is near the hip, towards the pubic bone, pull the bandage upward, and the other bandage below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, place the bandage near the knee and pull downward. Then, the physician should align the bone with both hands until it resembles its natural shape.
If the bone unites well, then the bandage and pull should be maintained unless the limb develops a hot swelling.  If swelling occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to the treatment.
As for the pulling, a wide, firm bandage should be wrapped around the fracture twice or thrice, leaving some excess material. Then the leg should be pulled until the heel reaches the top of the thigh.  A long thread should be inserted between the thigh and leg, near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread should emerge from above, on both sides.
Then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.  Place splints on the thigh, at the site of the fracture, and make one splint on the shinbone.  Then fill the space between the thigh and leg with soft cloths to equalize the pull.
Then begin with a strong pull from the center, over the fracture site, three or four times.  As the bandage moves further from the fracture, the pull should be less, softer, and looser.
Then, take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie the adjacent splints on top to it. Then, bring the ends of the thread down until they reach the heel of the foot, and tie them to the ends of the splints on the other side as well.
So that the bandage does not shift from its position, leave the pull on it as long as no swelling, inflammation, or puffiness occurs on the limb. If any of these occur, immediately loosen it and correct whatever happened, as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a splinter in the bone that pierces, if possible, smooth it. Otherwise, cut it and remove it, and treat the wound as described previously until it heals.  Sometimes, the thigh fracture can be splinted without the leg being splinted along with it.
As we mentioned in the case of the arm and forearm, although the fracture is treated in this way, the patient does not become lame.  However, if it is splinted alone without the leg, the patient will always be lame.
Know that the thigh takes 50 days or a little more or a little less to heal, all depending on the variation in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On fractures of the kneecap.
The kneecap rarely fractures, but often suffers contusions. If a fracture does occur, it is either a crack or fragmentation of its parts, and this may happen with or without a wound.
One must rely on examination and reduce the fracture by aligning the separated parts with the fingers, until they come together and unite as best as possible with gentle precision and care.  Then, apply a bandage and a circular splint if necessary.
And apply additional support in accordance with that. Then, treat all situations described for other fractures, such as inflammation and the like, by addressing each symptom appropriately until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the treatment of fractured leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the ulna.  They are susceptible to the same types of fractures as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are fractured, the leg is displaced in all directions. If the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is displaced forward.  If the thicker bone is fractured, and this occurs from below, this is apparent to you.
Therefore, use traction and alignment, and bandage the splints accordingly, just the same. However, if the fracture of the leg is a severe one with many fragments, the traction should be less and gentler, and exert less force in its reduction.
There is something additional in the treatment of the leg compared to the arm.  Once you have aligned the splints and completed all your work, take two pieces of juniper wood—which are used for leveling rooms, or those made of palm fronds or similar materials—
Choose one that is slightly thick, not thin, and make its length equal to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.  Then wrap each one with a cloth, wrapping it twice lengthwise. Place one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let them be from the knee to the bottom of the foot. Then tie the two pieces of wood in three places, at the ends and the middle.  With this restraint, the leg will not tilt to the right or left and will be properly straightened. A wooden gutter may also be used along the length of the leg.
Place it in the gutter to prevent movement.  This is especially important for fractures accompanied by a wound.  Examine the leg daily, and pay close attention to any swelling or inflammation. If any of these occur, treat them as appropriate until healing.  The leg bone will be set within thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
Fractures of the bones of the leg and fingers.
The heel bone is rarely fractured.  The leg bones may be fractured, and the fingers are also rarely fractured, but are more often bruised.
If a fracture of the leg bones occurs and you see the bones overlapping, have the patient stand on the ground, upright, like a walker.  Then, place your foot on the protruding bones, and press down to align them.
Until they are returned to their proper positions.  Then, take the bandage and splint, placing a small, flat board with two flattened ends under the sole of the foot. Securely bind the foot with the wrappings and whatever else is needed.
After three or four days, release the bandage.  You will find the bones aligned, whether they were fractured or dislocated. The procedure is as described.  If a finger is fractured, manipulate and align it as described for the fingers of the hand.
Then, create a splint for the fractured finger, the length of the finger, and slightly wider. Place the board described under the foot, and secure it firmly.  If two, three, or more bones are fractured.
Place a splint for each finger, sized to fit, wrapped in soft cloth. Secure the board to the sole of the foot.  Let each end of the board extend beyond the foot to provide good support.
You must remember to apply all the procedures described for other fractures, addressing each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the fracture of the woman's pubic bone and the man's penis.
When the woman's vagina is fractured, have her sit in a squatting position, then gently lean her back slightly, holding her from behind.  Then, have the midwife pack her vagina with cotton until it is full, like a ball.
Then, have the woman shake, and lift her pelvis slightly, little by little, for the cotton will come out until it is like a ball at the entrance of the vagina, and the fractured bone will be restored.  Then place a pad on her back; whenever she wishes to urinate, gently remove the cotton so that she may urinate.
And return it to the position in which you first inserted it, then return to the original pad. Do this for seven days or so, and it will mend.  If you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube of reed to its opening, and insert the whole bladder into her vagina.
Then blow into the tube forcefully so that the bladder inflates within the vagina, and the fracture will return. Then pack it with cotton and keep her as described for a number of days until she heals.  As for if the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, this is used for its repair.
Its treatment is as described for the hip bone.  The correct approach in these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, especially for those with some experience and who understand this book, is clear, because the fracture itself, in most cases, guides you.
For proper treatment and strengthening, understand this. Now, if a man's penis is fractured, take the windpipe of a goose, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it and bind it. Leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On setting fractures of bones if there is a wound.
If someone presents with a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus, or similar, one should immediately perform cupping if the conditions for cupping, as previously mentioned, are favorable.
If the wound is bleeding, you should immediately cauterize it with powdered alum if nothing else is available. Then, proceed to set the fracture on that very day and do not delay it.
If no hot swelling occurs, if a hot swelling does occur, then postpone the setting of the fracture until the ninth day, so that the hot swelling subsides. Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, as it will expose it to bad symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin, exposed, then you should gently attempt to return and align it with your hands, with a slight extension.  If you cannot return and align it with your hands, return it using this instrument, which is an instrument made of iron, seven or eight fingers in length. And its width should match the wound.
Therefore, the physician should prepare three or four of them, depending on what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture.  Let them be round, with a slight thickness so that they will not bend when prodded during use.
And it should be sharp-pointed, with a bend at the tip.  Its top should be thick, and from the middle down, it should be much thinner.  This is its image/representation:.
It is called, in Greek, *permos*, meaning a small lever.  The sharp, bent tip should be placed on the protruding end of the bone and pushed once until the bone has returned and aligned somewhat, then align the fracture ends with each other.
If the fractured end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, then the end of that bone should be cut so that the instrument can hold it. If you cannot restore the bone in the manner we have described, cut it with a similar section as those we have mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws, however you can. Then remove any remaining roughness and thin scales from the bone. If, after returning the bone, the patient experiences intense, harmful pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can return it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient.  Once you have completed setting the bone, dip a cloth in a dark, astringent drink, especially if it is summer. Do not place any bandaging or anything oily on the wound.
So that putrefaction and decay do not occur. Then use splints when you are finished setting the bone. Leave the wound uncovered, by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, the size of the wound.
Beware, with utmost care, of tightening the wound with the fracture.  Often, ignorant physicians do this, causing their patients either death or ulceration, or a cold. Let your tightening be gentle and loose, contrary to the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or large, and you fear some of the adverse symptoms we have described, and the patient experiences distressing pain in the area, you should not apply splints.  Make bandages of strong cloths for the wound, in place of splints, and apply them tightly.
If, after a day or two, you see pus starting to form in the wound, remove the cloth soaked in the drink that you placed on it. Then use the compresses and ointments that are our custom to treat wounds, such as the four-part ointment and similar ones. You should also loosen the bandages.
Examine the wound every evening and morning until it heals and is cured.  You should position the limb so the pus drains downwards easily. If the wound takes many days to heal, and the pus does not cease, know that there are small pieces of broken bone.
Therefore, you should probe the wound with a probe.  If any of those fragments are loose, remove and extract them. If any remain embedded, causing the limb to be wounded and causing pain, then use any possible means to cut them out and remove them.
If the wound develops a cold, or eating away, or another type of decay or corruption, you should treat each symptom with a similar remedy, as described in its respective section.
If a large, prominent bone such as the femur, humerus, or similar large bones is fractured, you should not attempt to pull or remove it. For often death results from this. Leave it until it decays, for perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see an opportunity for treatment, otherwise leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
On the treatment of complications following certain fractures.
This complication frequently arises after the fracture has healed, especially if near the joints, making the limb unsightly and possibly hindering its natural function.
If the complication is fresh, use astringent remedies such as licorice, frankincense, myrrh, pomegranate root, and acacia, taking some or all of these and mixing them with a contracting syrup, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the complication with careful pressure, firmly binding it, and leaving it for many days without loosening it, then loosening it and repeating the process until the complication subsides, God willing, or attach a tight lead plate to it.
Lead has the property of removing all abnormalities in the limbs. If the complication has hardened and intensified, and necessity compels its removal, then cut through it from above and remove the excess protruding parts or scrape them off with a suitable instrument until it is gone. Treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In treating fractures, if the limb is, after being set, still thin and not restored to its original condition.
If a broken bone is set and the limb remains thin and weak afterwards, this may be due to many reasons. One reason is excessive loosening and improper binding of ligaments, or excessive tightening of ligaments preventing nourishment from reaching the limb.  Another is excessive and improper bandaging, or excessive and inappropriate movement.  Or else, a lack of blood and weakness in the patient's body.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich their body to increase the blood, use baths, bring joy and happiness, and apply bitumen to the limb to draw nourishment to it, or bathe the limb in lukewarm water. So that nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On treating fractured bones that are forcibly straightened and prevented from acting as they should.
When a limb that has been set straight after healing shows a crookedness or protrusion of the fractured bone, or a complex deformity, and the appearance of the limb is thus marred. However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, one should not accept the claims of those who say that the limb should be broken from the head, as many ignorant physicians and bone setters in our country do.
This action is highly reprehensible and leads to great risk and potential injury. However, if the crookedness and deformity are recent, then it is advisable to apply water in which relaxing herbs like the plantain leaf, its root, and the crown flower and similar substances have been boiled.
And apply softening dressings such as well-crafted diachylons, or take the sap of the plantain root, mix it with chicken fat and ghee, and apply as a dressing.  Alternatively, take ripe figs, crush them with pigeon dung, and similar remedies called "breakers of inflammation," and apply as a dressing.
And the deformity will resolve with gentle, continuous massage using the hands, and the limb should be moved in every direction at all times. If the curvature is old, severe, and has become rigid, and treatment with iron is necessary.
Then it is necessary to saw above it, severing the connection of the bone and removing any excess deformity or bone with delicate cuts.  Care and effort should be used in this process.  Then, treat the wound using the previously mentioned methods until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is a dislocated joint, preventing movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing severe pain and discomfort to the sufferer.  If someone presents with a dislocated jaw, it is necessary to promptly attempt its repositioning.
Do not delay at all; if delayed, the affected area will swell and become a mass, making jaw repositioning more difficult.  Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor should it be moved or stretched while swollen, as this often causes painful spasms and discomfort to the patient.
However, if this occurs, the patient should be bled, then allowed to rest until the swelling subsides slightly.  Afterwards, the affected area should be bathed in warm water and applied with ointment.  Then, the jaw should be gently repositioned, and each limb treated as described in its relevant section.
The sections on the jaw are also arranged, as previously mentioned, based on the fractures from the upper to the lower body.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the lower jaw.
The jaws rarely dislocate, and their displacement occurs in one of two ways: either they move slightly out of place, relaxing somewhat, or they completely and fully dislocate, relaxing entirely. To the chest, such that the patient's saliva drips and he cannot retain it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stumbles in speech.  If the dislocation is slight, it often returns to its place easily.
However, if the dislocation is complete, the return should be hastened, and delayed not at all.  The patient's attendant should grasp the head, and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw within the patient's mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
Or, if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, insert both thumbs; and with the rest of his fingers on the outside, he should straighten it.  He should instruct the patient to relax his jaw and allow it to move in any direction, while the physician straightens the jaw and pushes it back to its proper position.
If returning it is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved, use a compress soaked in hot water and ointment to make their return easier, and do not delay it, as we have said.  Once they have returned and are in place, and the patient's mouth is closed and they are not relaxed, then place linen strips on them with a plaster made from wax, ointment, and rose oil.
Then tie gently with a relaxed bandage. The patient should sleep on his back, with his head propped up between two pillows, so that he does not move it right or left, nor try to chew anything; instead, his food should be soft and easily swallowed.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw has healed, he may eat as desired. He should use caution and not strain his mouth opening for eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is healed.
If the jaws, once dislocated, do not return to their proper position, difficulty in their repositioning frequently results in fevers, persistent headaches, and possibly abdominal discomfort, and perhaps repeated vomiting. If you observe this, know that it is a sign of damage.
Often, those experiencing this condition die within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On repositioning the collarbone and shoulder joint.
As for the collarbone, it does not dislocate from the inside due to its connection to the chest, but it may dislocate outward, which is evident through touch. To reduce the dislocation, the patient should lie on their back with their arms extended.
Then apply firm pressure to the affected area with your hand, and it will return to its place.  Then apply a bandage and splints, and secure them.  As for the part of the collarbone next to the shoulder joint, to which it is connected, it rarely dislocates. Should it ever dislocate, it should be repositioned and set as we have described, or as seems appropriate to you.
Then apply a bandage, splints, and secure them.  Instruct the patient to remain still and quiet until healed.  This same treatment is used to reposition the shoulder joint if it also comes out of place.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On reducing the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder joint dislocates in three ways: one, towards the armpit, downwards; two, towards the chest; and three, sometimes upwards, away from the shoulder blade, which is rare.
It does not dislocate to the back of the shoulder blade or the front of the nerve.  It most often dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, as it quickly exits and quickly enters.
However, in those with substantial flesh, the case is different; it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty.  Sometimes, someone experiences a blow or fall and the shoulder swells with a hot, inflamed lump, and one might think it has dislocated; it is necessary to examine this thoroughly to ascertain the truth.
Then, in treating it, if the dislocation is downwards towards the armpit, when comparing the dislocated shoulder with the healthy one, you will find a clear difference. You will find the head of the dislocated shoulder rotated; under the armpit, the head of the shoulder will feel like an egg when touched.
The injured person cannot raise their arm to their ear, nor perform any other movements.  Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, this will be evident on examination, not hidden.
This dislocation may be easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  To reduce it, have an attendant raise the arm upwards.  Then, place your thumbs under the patient's armpit and forcefully raise the joint upwards to its proper position while the attendant raises and extends the arm.
Then, lower the arm, and it will quickly return to place.  If it does not return as described, and the dislocation has been present for many days, the patient should bathe in hot water and apply poultices that relax and soften the tissues, such as cooked date palm root, fenugreek, and crown flower in water.
Then, the patient lies on their back, and a ball of wool of moderate firmness is placed under their armpit. The physician places their heel on the ball and grasps the patient's arm, extending it downwards.
And pushes the ball with their foot, and it will return to its proper place.  Alternatively, you may reduce it in this way:  have a taller person stand beside the patient and position their shoulder under the patient's armpit, raising the patient's armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. And another attendant pulls the patient's arm downwards towards the abdomen.  If the patient is light, something else should be hung from the arm to weight it down; then the joint will return immediately.  It can also be reduced by another method.
Another method is to place a long, round-headed wooden board, like the pestle head of a mortar, neither thick nor thin, under the patient's armpit.  A soft cloth is placed on the top of the board, and the patient stands upright along the length of the board.
Then, the patient extends their arm downwards on the other side, and also extends their body forcefully on the other side.  The joint will return to its place quickly. If reduction is difficult using all the methods described, use this treatment: take a board approximately two cubits long. Its width is the equivalent of four fingers, and its thickness is the equivalent of two fingers.  It should have a rounded head to easily enter the armpit in this way:
Then, a soft cloth is tied to the rounded head to prevent the board from injuring the patient.  It is then placed under the armpit, and the entire arm and forearm are extended along the board downwards. The board is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then, the arm is placed on a crossbar.  The arm is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is allowed to hang from the other side. The joint will then enter its socket immediately. If it has entered in any way possible, a moderate-sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then, a bandage prepared from mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the entire shoulder, revolving it from above. The ball is then firmly tied from under the armpit, and the bandage is wrapped around it from above, securing the arm to the neck.
The patient's hand should remain immobile for seven days.  The patient's diet should be limited to strengthen the affected limb, which accelerates healing.  Then, after seven or five days, the bandage is removed, and the patient is encouraged to move the arm.  If it remains stable and does not become loose, healing has occurred.
If the joint frequently dislocates due to moisture or another cause, cauterization with three layers of cauterization, as described in the chapter on cauterization, should be applied. If all of this is done, and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the joint still does not stabilize,
If the bandage and its tightness are repeated, and the joint still does not stabilize, and it slips and loosens, and cannot be raised, then know that the nerve in the shoulder's head has been severed, stretched, or loosened.  In that case, know that the joint will never stabilize.
For a dislocated jaw, positioned near the chest and breast, and extending to the back, it should be repositioned by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to its proper position.  All other binding and treatments should be employed until healing is complete.  If, after healing, the limb shows sensitivity and slow movement,
The patient should use baths frequently until the tenderness subsides and returns to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
On the treatment of a dislocated elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty.  It dislocates in all directions, especially forward or backward.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, because it is visible and palpable, and in whatever way it dislocates.
If you align the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, this will be clearly evident to you through the depression of the joint.  The arm cannot be bent, and the shoulder cannot be brought against it.  You should act quickly and return the dislocation before a hot swelling develops.
If a hot swelling develops, its return will be difficult, and it may never heal, especially if the dislocation is backward.  This is the worst of all dislocations, the most painful, and often leads to death.
If it is possible to return it, the attendant should extend his/her hand, with both hands and the arm outstretched.  The physician's hand should be positioned above and below the elbow, pushing the joint back into place with both thumbs or the base of the hand.
If the dislocation is forward, it may be returned by bending the hand until the base of the palm strikes the shoulder which is opposite it. If the dislocation does not return, use very strong and forceful traction.  Two attendants should extend the arm.
Two attendants should also hold the patient to prevent any movement during the traction.  Then the arm should be rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide bandage around the hand. If the physician applies his hands to the joint, he should anoint them with ointment to allow easy movement of the joint.
Then the joint should be forcefully pushed back into place.  After its return, a bandage containing a compress, desiccant, and egg white should be applied tightly, and the arm should be suspended from the patient's neck for several days.
Then remove it. If the joint is firmly in place, release the bandage and leave it. If the joint does not seem firm, reapply the bandage and sling, and leave it for several days until it is firm, then remove it. If there is swelling after the joint is returned and the bandage is removed.
If there is difficulty in movement, use moist heat in a bath, gentle massage, and rubbing until it becomes supple.  Alternatively, place a large, fat sheep's fleece on the joint, bandage it, and leave it in place for a day and night. Then remove it and put the patient in a bath. When he sweats, massage the joint gently.
Then repeat the sheep's fleece application one, two, and three times, each time entering the bath until it becomes supple. If you prefer, apply wet, soft cow's dung mixed with butter to the joint, and bandage it. Do this repeatedly.  This will soften the joint and return it to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist frequently dislocates and its reduction is easier than for other joints, but it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the time of dislocation before inflammation or a hot swelling occurs in the affected area.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board, and have an assistant extend the arm. The physician should place his hand on the prominent part of the joint and push until it returns to its normal position. However, it is necessary to observe whether the dislocation has moved to the palm of the hand.
Let the patient place the palm of their hand on the board when extending and reducing it. If the dislocation is prominent on the back of the hand, let the patient place their palm on the board so that the physician's hand is over the same prominent part of the joint. If it returns immediately, otherwise, bind it with a dressing to relieve the swelling.
Leave it alone and do not attempt to reduce it again.  After several days, it cannot be reduced, and the joint will remain crooked, causing no harm to the patient, except that the hand will be weak and unable to grasp anything.
At that point, you will know that the nerve is severed or damaged, and there is no remedy except to bind with a bandage. This may or may not be helpful. Once the wrist is reduced, apply the described bandage, bind tightly, and leave it on for five days.
Then, it is removed, and the hand is exercised. If movement is difficult and there is any stiffness, soften it with heated water and massage repeatedly until it becomes flexible.
Chapter Twenty-nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction.  If a finger dislocates toward the palm's surface or back, extend the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumb until it returns to place.  Then bandage the finger's head and support it toward the direction it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and stretch it until it is straight that day. If it is night, bandage it in the same way.  Continue to unbandage it during the day and exercise its movement, and bandage it at night, doing this for several days until it strengthens.
And do the same if it dislocates toward the palm's underside.  Bandage it toward the same direction, and do the same as in your initial treatment until it heals.  Do the same if it dislocates to other directions.
Chapter Thirty.
In treating a dislocated vertebra.
When a vertebra in the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, for death comes quickly to the patient.
A sign of this is that the patient's stool comes out involuntarily; he cannot control it.  Often, some of his limbs—either his legs, or arms, or one of them—become relaxed.  If only one vertebra is displaced, it often shifts further.
And its displacement can occur in four directions.  The one that moves backward is called a hump.  Its treatment is as follows:  consider if the hump occurred from childhood.  If so, there is no treatment, and it will not be cured.  However, if it occurred from a fall or blow, or something similar...
The ancients described various treatments in lengthy explanations, much of which proved fruitless.  I have summarized what is essential, using few words to encompass much of what they presented, clarifying the meaning and illustrating the apparatus differently than they described and explained.
I say that a hump that develops in the front of the chest cannot be treated or cured, and neither can one that develops to the sides.  Only the one that forms in the back is treated, specifically as I describe—the patient is laid on their face.
On a level bench near a wall, spread a damp cloth underneath to prevent injury to his chest.  Then place an upright plank, planted in a hole in the ground, near his head at the edge of the bench, and another plank near his feet at the opposite edge of the bench.
A servant holds one plank, which is not secured in the hole, and another servant holds the other in the same manner. Then, a soft, strong bandage is wrapped around the patient's chest and under their armpits, and the end of the bandage is extended to the plank by the patient's head and tied to it.
Then another bandage is tied above the patient's thighs, above their knees, and at their ankles.  Then all the bandages are gathered and tied to the other plank by the patient's feet, and each servant pulls the plank in their direction with the bandage, and the planks remain in their anchored positions.
However, they are not secured, as we said.  The physician places his hands firmly on the hump until it straightens, or he places a board on it, then leans on the board with his feet until it straightens.  If it does not straighten with this treatment, take a board about three cubits long.
A place is dug in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, to accommodate the end of the board.  Then, the middle of the board is placed on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls firmly to press on the hump.
And it will return to its place.  If you wish, you can make it with a hand-twisted spring—that is, to drive two planks into the ground, each a cubit long, at the head of the patient at the end of the shop, and two more planks at the patient's feet at the other end of the shop.
Let there be a span between each plank.  A hole is made in each plank through which the spring passes, and the planks are firmly secured in the ground so they do not move at all.  A round stick, which is the spring to be twisted, is inserted into the holes in the planks.
At its end is a hole secured with a stick a span long, that is twisted.  The same is done for the other two planks. Then, the bandage that you tied to the patient's chest is tightened on the spring at the head, and the bandages tied to the legs are tightened on the spring at the feet.
Then, a servant stands at each spring, twisting the spring with the twisting tool. The physician adjusts the hump as we previously described. This is the image of the spring, the shop, and the patient.
Then, after the fracture returns and the area is aligned, you should apply a bandage that has been dried with egg white, followed by another bandage. Then place a splint made of wood, whose width is about three fingers or thereabouts, and whose length is the same as the extent of the hump.
And on some sound beads, then bind with the appropriate bandage. The patient should use gentle food until healed.  If some protuberance remains in the area at the end of healing, then use medicines that relax and soften, along with the splint we described for a long time.
A lead plate may also be used in this case.  A protuberance may appear at the end of the spinal beads, causing suspicion of dislocation. It could be an extra bone that has protruded, and you should not treat this with this therapy, as death might occur.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and are not subject to the slight displacement and subluxation that occur in other joints.  The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
This is because it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward.  Inward dislocation is most common, while forward or backward dislocation is less common.  A sign of inward dislocation is that if you compare the patient's healthy leg to the affected one, the healthy leg will be longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will be unable to bend their leg at the groin.  The area next to the groin will be swollen and noticeably inflamed, indicating that the head of the thigh bone has moved there.
The signs of outward dislocation are the opposite of these signs.  A sign of forward dislocation is that the patient can fully extend the leg, but cannot bend it without pain in the knee.  If they try to walk forward, they are unable to.
The patient will retain urine and the groin will be swollen.  When walking, they will place their weight on the heel.  A sign of backward dislocation is that the patient cannot straighten or bend the knee before bending the groin, and the leg is also shorter than the other.
The groin will be relaxed, and the head of the thigh bone will be prominent at the hip area.  As for the treatment of these types of dislocations, if the dislocation has been long-standing and the patient has not attempted to realign it, there is absolutely no treatment.
Therefore, one should not allow it to occur.  As for a recent dislocation, regardless of the type—one of the four directions of dislocation—immediately manipulate the joint by extending and flexing it inwards and outwards, and move it right and left, perhaps...
If it returns, no further treatment is needed. If it does not return this way, a strong assistant should be positioned to extend the leg from below, either with their hands or a bandage tied around the leg above the knee, while another assistant extends it from above.
By placing their hands under the armpits, then tightening a soft bandage around the top of the thigh.  A third assistant holds the end of the bandage and extends it either forward from the groin toward the collarbone, or backward towards the back.
All of them should extend simultaneously, until the patient lifts their body from the ground and hangs suspended. This type of extension is common to all four types. If the dislocation returns as described, otherwise, each type requires its own specific treatment, as described.
If the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on their healthy side, and a bandage is placed around the upper thigh, between the top of the thigh and the area below the groin.
Then the bandage is pulled upward from the groin toward the upper body, towards the collarbone.  Another strong assistant, with their arms, should then grasp the thick part of the affected thigh and pull it strongly outward, causing it to return to its proper place.
This type is easier than other methods for returning this limb. If this method fails and you cannot achieve repositioning with this treatment, then you should tie both of the patient's legs firmly with a soft bandage, at both ankles and knees.
Each bandage should be about four finger-widths apart. The affected leg should be extended further than the other by two finger-widths.  The patient should then be suspended from the head using a piece of wood inside the house, which should be about two arm's lengths from the ground.
Then a strong servant should grasp the top of the thigh, and another servant should hold the patient.  The servant holding the thigh should push with force, and the joint will quickly return to its proper place.  As for its specific repositioning if the dislocation is outward...
The patient should lie on the bed, as described for the humpback patient.  The bandage should be tight on the affected leg and chest.  Then, two pieces of wood should be placed, one at the patient's feet and the other at the head.  Another piece of firmly secured wood should be placed in the center of the bed.
Damp cloths should be wrapped around [the wood] to prevent injury to the patient.  The wood should be placed between the patient's thighs to prevent downward displacement during stretching.  Each attendant should pull in their direction and the physician should adjust the hip with their hands. If the limb returns to its place...
Otherwise, place the board and compress it, as described for the humpback, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side.  If the dislocation is forward, the patient's leg should be extended once again, following the same description, on the bed.
The physician should place the palm of his right hand on the affected hip, and press it with the other hand.  While doing this, the pressure should be extended downward towards the knee.  If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be stretched downwards.
He should be elevated from the ground, but positioned on a firm surface.  The hip should also be positioned outward, as described in the instructions for lying on the bed, face down, with tight bandages.
As we previously stated, the board should also be used to compress the area where the joint has dislocated.  When the hip joint has returned properly, a sign of its return that you should know is that you can extend the patient's leg.
If you see both legs are level, and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned to its proper position. Then, bind the thighs together, apply the bandage, and secure it tightly with a head cloth.  The hip should not move in any direction.
The patient must remain at rest for three or four days.  Then, loosen the bandage and wrap, and compare the legs. If you find them equal in size, know that the fracture is stable.  Allow the patient to walk. If you see any looseness, [do not allow him to walk].
Return and bandage it again, as tightly as you did initially. Leave it for three days, then remove it, and allow him to walk slowly for a few days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On the treatment of a fractured knee.
The knee fractures in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (i.e., backward).  It does not fracture forward. A sign of a fracture is to instruct the patient to pull their leg toward their thigh.
If the leg does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is fractured. To set all types of fractures, have the patient sit, extending their legs if able. A helper should sit behind the patient, holding their torso and gently twisting it backward slightly. Then you sit on their thighs.
Place your back against the patient's body, and position the leg between your legs.  Then, grasp the knee with both hands, interlocking your fingers on the knee.  Next, firmly press both sides of the knee with your hands.  Another assistant should extend the leg to return the knee to its place.
A sign that it is returned to place is that the leg adheres to the thigh without force, smoothly.  Then bandage, and fasten the leg to the thigh.  Then bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release.  Only allow minimal walking for days until strength returns.
If you cannot return it using the method described, then use strong traction with the bandages I previously described for treating the hip, until it returns to its place.
Chapter Thirty-three.
On treating a dislocated heel.
The heel may dislocate slightly or completely.  Dislocation can occur either inward or outward.  A sign of dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and protruding towards the direction in which it has dislocated.
As for treating a slight dislocation, it is easy to return it; gently pull with the hands and align it until it returns to its place.  However, if it has dislocated completely, the patient should sit down, and a strong servant should hold him firmly from behind in the middle of his back.
Then, with your right hand grasp his foot from the top, and with your left hand from the bottom, at the ankle.  Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand, twice. Then, pull the foot with your left hand, and push the front of the foot towards the leg with your right hand without force.
Repeat this process twice as described.  Then, on the third time, push the front of the foot towards the leg while pulling on the ankle. If it returns to its place in one or two attempts with this method and you see the foot aligned, then proceed no further; if not, repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If it does not return using the methods described, have the patient lie on his back on the ground.  Securely fix a firmly-bound wooden peg to the ground so that it lies between his thighs. A cloth has been wrapped around it so that the patient is not harmed, and a servant holds his thigh.
Then another servant stretches the leg, either with their hands or with a bandage tied around the patient's neck.  Each servant pulls in the opposite direction, while the peg remains positioned between the patient's thighs, holding them still so the body does not pull downwards with the stretch.  Then the physician aligns the joint with his hands.
Another servant holds the healthy leg downwards.  Then the joint will quickly return to its place.  If the joint returns and you are certain that it has returned correctly, take the bandage and splint and tighten it with firm bindings. Tie the foot to the lower part of the splint.  Take care to avoid the nerve that is located behind the heel.
So that the bandage is not too tight and causes him pain.  Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it, and then release it on the third or fourth day.  The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, there is a risk that the joint will dislocate and become irreparable.  Treatment will then be ineffective.  If a hot swelling appears, then the methods of treatment and application described elsewhere in this text should be used to relieve it until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of a dislocated toe.
The dislocated part should be realigned with a gentle pull, without force.  This is not difficult, but rather easy. If the dislocation is in one of the toes on the foot's upper part, the patient should place their foot on a flat surface.
Or on a board while standing, like a walker.  Then, you place your foot on the protruding joint and press down firmly with your foot until it returns to its proper position and no protrusion is visible.
Then place a board under the sole of their foot, covering the entire foot, with two ends.  Tie it securely for three days.  Then loosen it and keep them from walking for many days until it is strong and a return is avoided, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On the types of dislocations occurring with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both.
When something like this occurs and you attempt treatment and reduction, death often follows.
Therefore, one should not undertake such treatment unless one is skilled in the craft, experienced, gentle, compassionate, careful, and not reckless or rash.  Initially, one should use medications that relieve only the inflammatory swellings and allow the patient to rest.
Except by God's will, unless you hope for the patient's safety from injury with the disease's mildness and some hope appears to you, then return him from the very beginning, before the inflammatory swelling occurs.
If the limb returns to its desired position, use the treatment that relieves inflammatory swellings and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments.  If the dislocation is with a fracture and detached fragments have appeared in the bone, then remove them. Follow in that regard what we have mentioned regarding simple illnesses in the preceding sections.
Strive diligently and purify yourself from entering the path of uncertainty, as I have previously instructed you. This will preserve your reputation and safeguard your presentation, God willing.
