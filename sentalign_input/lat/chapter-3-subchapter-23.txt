On the discussion of dislocation.
Chapter 24.
Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its natural position.
Thus it is prevented from movement, and the limbâ€™s form is disfigured.
It causes the patient severe pain and injury.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to quickly restore it and not delay at all.
For if delayed, the area may become inflamed, and perhaps hinder the reduction of the dislocation.
For this reason, it should not be moved or extended when it is inflamed.
Since often it causes spasms and harmful pains.
But when this happens, you must promptly perform bloodletting on the patient.
Then leave it until the inflammation subsides.
Then rub the limb with warm water and oil.
Then it should be reduced with ease.
And treat every limb with the appropriate remedy, which will be discussed in its proper place.
Indeed, I have already organized the chapters on dislocation, just as in fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
