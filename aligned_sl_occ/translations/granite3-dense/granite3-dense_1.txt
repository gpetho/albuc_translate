And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
The first source sentence translates to: "However, the operation is performed in our region and at our time with total privacy, as soon as I deemed it necessary for the science of the art, and the sight of it was left; and I did not want to write about it except for some small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which I destroyed because they were errors and I wanted to extend my understanding of the art and its force.
It is seen by me that you live in this order of this treatise on the second way of exposure and declaration, and because of which the forms of the tools of cauteries and of the other instruments of the work, as well as for their preparation, are necessary.
The reason why the artisan is not able to make this work in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and that the actor does not know how to be exercised in the science of anatomy, which knows the advantages of the members and their forms, as well as the connection and separation of them; and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their kind; and of the pulsating veins and quiet ones, and of the locus of the edema of them.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
We have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book; however, what is not clear about this is that we do not know if it is correct regarding anatomy, as many people have died because of this science and it is mistaken for another.
You saw a doctor and the patient had an abscess in the thigh, and he incised several arteries in the thigh so that a large amount of pus flowed out when the patient died between the legs of the man.
You saw another doctor who believed that the woman had a stone in her bladder that had been processed in her state, and the stone was large, and it came out of the woman's body through the urethra, so that the woman died on the third day.
You have already called for help and saw that the large size of the stone and the position of the thigh under the woman made her die.
When a doctor from our land took the stipend of a duke for performing surgery and went to a blacksmith who was known for his expertise in treating fractures in the thigh; and the doctor, being ignorant, cleaned the fracture, over the plague, with punches and needles, and reinforced the strong structure, and did not leave any traces on the wound.
The incision was made according to the patient's will, and the relief, and the dressing was changed every few days and commanded that we uncover the limb; and it is said that the thigh and foot were affected, and it was found to be lost.
And you called upon him and appeared to make the incision, and after a while, peace was established and the patient no longer felt any pain.
However, the corruption was already confirmed in the member, so it could not be stopped, and the corruption spread throughout the thigh as long as the wound was open.
I saw another doctor who performed a cauterization on the wound and caused it to ulcerate every few days, until the malice of the lord of the land was revealed.
The cause of this pain is the twisted bone caused by melancholic humor, which does not cover that it has come to your iron of all, but rather that it is a member of the one suffering that of all has been harmed.
For this reason, children, it is necessary for you to have the operation divided into two parts: one part is for the operation associated with health, and the other part is for the one that endangers the larger possessions.
And you have already existed here in every part of this free in which the operation was made where error and fear occurred; for what is necessary for you to guard this and lay it aside, so that the people do not fall into speaking and with you being unjust.
And then secure your weapons with care and protection from God, and your wounds with difficulty and closure.
And use the best way for the grace of God to be healthy and praised succession, and lay aside the terrible wounds of difficult cure, and guard your weapons with that which you fear, so that you are not deceived by your faith and your name: four more remain in your glory, and push on in the world and further in your sanctity.
Gallantly has already been said in some of my sermons: When you do not treat a wound with a proper medicine, because the bad parts do not sit down.
You have already had to read this text three chapters.
Begin the division of the text, and first of the first part. The first chapter ordered from the inside of the foot, in the forms of the instruments and of the cauteries' furnaces, and as is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of dryness and perforation, and of winds, and of plagues, and of extraction of sages and similar things, all chapter ordered in the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, of restoration and displacement, and of cure of twisting and similar things; chapter ordered from the inside of the foot, and in the forms of the instruments.
I ask you to question the quality of the cauteries and the nocuums of that, and in what collection it is forbidden to use cauteries.
Therefore, I say that the discourse on the quality of cauteries and nocuums is long and prolix, subtle by knowledge, secret, and yet understood by few, and those who speak it are in disagreement, and for me a little of their words is enough to fear tedium.
And therefore I say that cauteries comfort all the whole collection universally, except for two collections, which are those of its matter.
In the dry and cold collection of matter, it will dehydrate; four others said that cauteries are useful for that, and the others said the opposite, that cauteries are not convenient in drunkenness, which is due to its quality and dryness, and nature of the fire is also quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that drunkard and dry matter is caut and sec is sane.
When you say that it is not good for the whole tail of the cow's anus to be cauterized, but rather for the entire anus and dry skin that appears in the chest of men, when you compare the chest of a man and his humidity with the entire focus, it harms the chest of a man.
When speaking of this, I have already experienced it in my own life on several occasions.
However, I do not know what kind of expertise one would have to apply this knowledge, or the diversity of the human body and its dispositions, the causes of those diseases, their accidents, and the passage of time for those.
However, in other complexions, it is not about your fear, and particularly in wet and gross diseases, where all doctors are agreed on this, and there is no disagreement in the practice of cauterization in those.
However, wise sons, you know that the secret of healing by cauterization is fire and the goodness of the wound, which is why cauterization is considered a part of medicine, and the focus is simple, the adjustment of which does not reach the other member except for the one being cauterized and not the other member.
However, the adjustment of burning medicine does not reach the member that is being cauterized, and more comes to the member with difficult cure and more hears it.
When the fire is too hot, due to its sublimity and good substance, it does not cause pain unless it is excessive. And we have known this by experience and through the length of service in the study of the art of truth; and for this reason you are excused from the length of this sermon and if not, it would not be relevant to your free time in this pause with your secret desire for the fire, and the quality of the operation of the focus in the heart and the expulsion of the waste through which the wastes are expelled, the philosophical sermon is demonstrated, which sharpens in your minds.
E sapiatz, filhs, que els se desacordion del temps en le qual es convenient far cauteri e pausan le milhor temps de primaveyra.
I believe the text is discussing the use of cauterization in medicine during the medieval period. Here's the translation of the first source sentence:
When there is no pain in your feet, or rather, as children say, not even the common people and the old doctors think it is cured by cauterization, and they wait for the consequences, then...
And the cause is not clear to them as to what they are treating with, for cauterization is not a substitute for medicine, which alters the complexion and dries out the moisture that causes the pain.
However, cauterization is often used over medicine due to its excellent value and the good reputation of its operation and the great lord.
It is possible that the disease may return at some time, according to the complexity of the disease and its location in the body, as well as the good reputation of the doctor, and that it is prepared in the body of the patient by the addition of superfluities in the body, and that it reaches the patient through his acquisition of similar causes; but if the disease that is administered cauterization is a subtle disease in a few parts of the member and moisture, then as cauterization for toothache and similar things, it is possible that in this case it does not return to that pain, more so if it is done in small doses.
This appears to be a medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. The text discusses various medical procedures and their meanings. Here's a line-by-line translation:
The cause is in contrast to this; and the understanding that cauterization is not but the last remedy of medicine is only when they administer the bandages of cure in some diseases, and those medicines do not conform, and rather in the end of the cause they maintain man cauterization, and profit therein. When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
The first line of the text translates to: "They removed the old points that were made with cautery, and did not remove them unless they were equal in quality to the cautery itself.
When the location for cauterization is not painful, as it is not absolutely true, but you have already attempted and failed to make that point in another part of the body, and cauterization is better than cutting with iron that was previously used; however, when you perform cauterization, it is not declared to you that the gold content varies according to the amount you want for the hardness of the gold, and you prepare the reception of the flesh; and if you adjust over the ignition point, the gold will be in the fire, and there may be some layers for the craftsman to occupy that part.
And therefore, for this reason, it is necessary to use the iron lightly and carefully in the direction of the operation.
And you have already ordered this capital in cauterization according to the capitals, and ordered those of the foot within the feet, so that the requester can choose that one from you.
The first capital.
This cauterization confers humidity and coldness on the accident of which you cause harm, causing soda and numerous rheumatic fluxes, called corissa, from the head to the parts of the hoofs and nails, and numerous sleeping, and toothache and gout, and universally of all maladies that appear due to coldness, which are paralyzed, sore and apoplexy, and seem similar in those maladies.
The form of this cauterization is this, which initially commands the thigh that it be evacuated by civil medicine the cap of the foot, three or four times, according to what is asked by the virtue of the thigh and the age of the person and their custom.
And it commands that you shave the part where the pain is, and place your hands on the patient's shoulders over a low table and hold their hands on the painful part.
And place your thumb on the razor blade and press it against the razor's edge between the nails of your fingers. However, as the said place has been mentioned, mark that location with your finger, and pay attention to the olive oil cautery of which this is the form:
And place it over the location you have marked, with your hand that descends, with which the second thumb is slightly tightened little by little, and you will rotate that.
And lift your hand slightly and look at the place, and if you see any part of the bone emerging from it in any amount, then do as much as the amount of errors, raise your hand again, and if not turn the other, if it is cold, enter that as soon as you see the bone that I have told you to you.
When you have taken a small piece of salt and dissolved it over the area and rubbed it in three times, it is called a "salted wound." This is a traditional medical term used to describe a wound that has been treated with salt to prevent infection. The salt is believed to have antib
Then, pause over the border that is exposed in the edge and rub it on the inside where the focus scar is destroyed. This is a traditional medical term used to describe the process of applying a salve or ointment to a wound to promote healing and prevent infection. The term "salved" refers to the act of making something better or improving its condition. Then, cure the area with an antiseptic such as alcohol or vinegar if it is healthy. This is a traditional medical term used to describe the process of treating a wound with an antiseptic to prevent in
Then, it is known that when the Roman plague opens the throat, then half of the mouth gets the breathing tube, which is better and more useful. This is a traditional medical term used to describe the process of inserting a breathing tube into the throat to help a patient breathe when they are unable to do so on their own. The term "int
Then, it is known that when the doctors cauterize the nail within the ear and hold it with the cautery within the ear, then it is held in place until the part of the ear that is affected is healed. This is a traditional medical term used to describe the process of using a cautery to cauterize a nail within the ear to prevent it from being removed by the patient or to promote healing if it has become infected. The term "cauterized" refers to the act of burning
When the joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
It is customary for others to use a pointed cautery when it comes into contact with the skin, as soon as it presses on the strong bone within and as soon as the bone begins to crackle, and this is the method of making small alphecati: It is believed that the vapors from the head will escape from that place:
If the wound is kept clean for a long time and it is cured when it is solidified:
I have not seen these specific kinds of cauteries before, only in the fearful cases of some men; and if you lay that aside, it is better for your health when it is; that the head is connected by a solution of continuity of the flesh as has been testified in other members, and most especially when the head of the thigh is in its natural state.
And the first kind of cauterization is not as safe and better for your health; and from that you will see and it will be good for your health.
The given text appears to be a medieval medical treatise written
in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish
When chronic and long-lasting pain occurs in the whole head, and it is prolonged in the chest, and there are used gerras, cochias, capipurges, emplaustres, guatz, cadels, and wonders, and especially if it has been cauterized with a cautery that does not burn and does not profit from that cause, then consider whether the head of the chest is of great creation in its nature; and do not use large flees, and do not burn much, and use another cauterization on that with a smaller one. And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. Incise the codon and reveal the bone that has been found, and cut the joint on the side of the head in the area called the "V" and place a pointed cautery there, and it is placed in the area where the wind blows. And then open the abdomen, and do not discover the bone, but the thigh will become greatly painful, different from the pain of all other head cauteries.
And you direct this cauterization in its place, where it is said that this cauterization is used for the cauterization of the joints of the head and the occiput, and a subtle cauterization is made on that part of the head; and this is the form of it.
Capital term.
Of non-antique cauterization of migrants.
When in the head of the cap pain is felt, or a sharp pain enters the wrist, it is necessary to evacuate medicines from the head of the patient, and to administer other care, which you have said in the diseases of the maladies; and all should not profit, if cauterization is made in that way: either with a sharp cauterization from medicine like combustible, or with iron.
The first line of the source sentence is "Mays cauteri am medicina comburent". This can be translated as "More cauterization is used in medicine than is customary". The second line, "es que tu prenguas una dolsa de alh", means "if you take a heated iron". The third line, "e escorgas aquela e abcindas las extremitatz de lu de amdos les caps", This line can be translated as "And if you press the location of the pain in the temple with a needle that has been inserted into the place where it is located, inside which has been hidden". This seems to be a description of a medical procedure for treating headaches or other types of pain in the temple area.
This line can be translated as "And apply pressure on it for about three hours; and then remove the plaster and let it dry for two or three days, and then pause over the area that has been immersed in water within the place where it has been sore". This seems to be a description of a medical treatment for treating a sore or injured area of the skin. The use of water and the application of pressure and heat may be part of a traditional or alternative medical practice.
This line can be translated as "And cure it if it becomes healthy within the time that it is sane". This seems to be a description of a medical treatment for treating an
This line can be translated as "And if you see, make use of some medicines that are burning which you have written in the book of burning medicines". This seems to be a recommendation for the reader to consult a book of medical treatises for information on using burning medicines. The use of burning medicines was a common practice in medieval medicine, and the reader is advised to consult a reliable source for more
May's cauterization is second only to this method: iron for cauterization, of which this is the form:
This sentence is referring to a type of medical tool called a "clavicle" or "clavicle pin," which is used to hold the head in place. The text states that this tool is shaped like a thorn and is placed in a specific location on the patient's neck, where it provides support and stability.
This sentence is advising the practitioner to place their hand over the location of the pain and gently push down on it, in order to prevent further damage to the intestine that has been placed there. They should do this slowly and carefully, as the intestine can be easily injured if not handled properly.
This sentence is stating that if a large amount of intestine is forced into the abdominal cavity through the hole in the abdominal wall, it can cause the artery to become injured and lead to bleeding. To prevent this, the practitioner should gently push down on the intestine with their hand, making sure not to injure the artery that has been placed there.
This sentence is advising the practitioner to apply a poultice made of salt and water to the affected area, and then place the poultice over the location. They should leave the poultice in place for three days, and then remove it carefully, taking care not to cause any further injury. The text also states that the patient should be monitored to ensure that they are healing properly.
If you see, make points at the end of the thigh with a pointed cautery, and keep an eye out for the incision of the artery in this truly ancient migration.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Could you please provide
De cauterizacio d’emigranea antiqua: This means "of the cauterization of ancient migration." It seems to be
When you treat the ancient migration with this cauterization, and it has been said that the previous treatment was not effective, and sometimes due to the disease that does not suffice for what has been said in the first cauterization of medicine or of the cauterization of focus, then you should cover the cauterized thigh with something that is white, because it means at the location of the pain on the line of longitudinals of the one who is the most affected, or of that; and pause your hand for a moment and stretch it over the incision of the artery and push it into the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuation of the jaw, which is harmed by chewing, and that the tail does not become rough and the nerves that cause that, and that it does not become swollen.
If it is about the custody and caution of the flow of sinews from the arterial branch that is blocked, then in that place there is fear, and most importantly for that one who does not know what to do and is not studious and does not practice; and stop the operation on that.
And you will come to remember the rule of the flow of sinews in case of an accident of the artery according to the right hand side, in the location of this free one.
If you see of this bad case that does not feed this cautery and see the corpse of the bad one tolerateable, cauterize that in the middle location of the head cap as they have encountered, and care for the wound after it is healed.
And if you see, maintain the cautery that has said in the capital of stretching of the artery with an arterial cautery having two points, and this cauterization is better and less dangerous.
Capital.
Of the cauterization of the pain of gout.
When in the gout there is pain from cold and it is cured by causes that are laxative and by another care that I have said in the division, and it is not relieved by the pain, you ignorant of the cauterization, and this is the one that has the name of point, of which this is the form:
When a point is made on the nail, and it is directed towards the entire circumference of the toe as it rotates, or in the circuit of each example if the pain is in each one. Continue to use the cautery on the toe's sole, as many pus as necessary to reach the spot intended.
And if the cautery points on the entire toe, and that is sufficient, and properly cares for the holes inside that are healthy.
End of Chapter VI.
Of cauterization of warts.
Warts that are cured and treated with cauterization are not the same as those that come from fleas, as has been said in the sections of the diseases.
Avoid cauterization for spasms or twitches of the nerves.
When you cure that wart with scars, tears, and purification, and do not confirm your cure, you must first cauterize the thigh of the patient, then a small piece of cloth is placed on it to absorb the moisture, and finally the conjunctiva of the two lips is cauterized.
When stopping the cautery for the opposite side of the malady, four types of mollification do not appear in the part that appears to be healthy.
The form of cauterization is that you cauterize the part with the cautery at the right end of the swollen nasal pus, and on the other side, the length of which is the same as the length of the first, and then your hand departs from it when the quantity of the affected area of the ribs is burned.
This is the form of cauterization, and it is specific to the barber, the form of which is displayed on a table. However, there are few pus that are not seen; and it is believed that too much luxury causes a few.
And the treatment of the place where the procedure is performed is to heal when it is healthy.
Capitol, Chapter VII.
Of the cauterization of ancient apoplexy.
When ancient apoplexy occurs and is treated as has been said and does not confuse your medicine and the patient does not have a fever, you cauterize that part four times: on all the corners of the head; and you cauterize and the place of the head, as has been said; and you cauterize in the groin. When the hand of the cautery is made according to what is said, it means that the point has been made correctly.
And it has already been cauterized over the mouth of the stomach; and it is less painful; and you should apply your cure according to what is appropriate.
The first line of the text is "Capitol .viii." which

Cove que sian donatz al malaute en le comensament jerras grans e pilulas le servel mondificantz" translates to "It is believed that large and powdered pills are given to the thighs at the beginning to make them moisturized.
E aprop ras le cap tot del malaute e pausa sus le coguot de lu emplaustre de cetre descrit en le tractat dels emplastres" translates to "And then, shave the entire thigh and place the cork on the center described in the chapter on plasters.
E pausa aquel alcunas veguadas, quar aquel es manieyra de cauteri" translates to "And then, place some wet cloths on it, and that is the tool for cauterization. E fay aquo segon aquel meteys orde le qual ja he dit" translates to "And then, follow that order which I have already said.
E donc si per aquels sanat bo es; e sino, lahoras fay a lu tres cauteris en la deriera partida de sieu cap, les quals sian deysendentz de la partida pus sobirana del cap entro a la partida pus dejos del col" translates to "And if those can help, then; otherwise, do three cauterizations on the opposite side of the head, which are from the swollen part of the head to the part below the neck. When you pause between each cauterization of the said point, take care that the cauterization is properly done.
If you add more and the thigh is tolerable, then make the cauterization in that place; and if you see more addition, make the cauterization on both sides.
Take care to enter that part which is healthy; and let the cauterization be olive-shaped according to the form given.

When you heat that over the fire for a sufficient amount of time, the one who suffers from it feels it when they are in it. And you want that one to be in the corner of the head of the patient's neck and let it enter so that it is cold.
And you give a cold to the patient's thigh for a week, or in another way according to the rule of the patient's bowel that comes out if it is healthy; or if you want, you can make small points on the skin according to the least of the rules, but you have to hold the cauterant in an orderly manner: this is a type of cauterization that moistens the brain equally.
And you stop that hair from being wet on the border or in the gray of the scalp.

When you are declared by the doctors that gout begins in the leg by the means of the pins that I have told you in the division, then you start and give to the patient an ointment on the thigh that moistens the head of the patient, and hold it until all humidity is gone.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And command the patient to raise their head and cauterize that point with the pointed cautery in the middle of the forehead; and cauterize that point with two points over two templates if it is the beginning of urine in two wounds, or with one point if it begins in a single wound.
Incise all the veins and arteries that are left in front of the chest; and these cauteries are in that line on the templates.
And keep an eye on the flow of the salve when it is cauterized; and if you see the flow of the salve, stay with the point until the physician arrives.

Capitulum.xv.
Of the cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the eyelashes are converted into parts of the fingers and hand.
When the eyelashes of the eye are converted into parts of the fingers and hand, cauterization is applied to those areas with two fingers, four cauteries or a combination of both, according to the doctor's prescription.
If the cauterization is done with fire, order the patient to look at their eyelashes as they are usually seen in the mirror, and if the hand is affected, then you must stretch the fingers of the cauterization with a needle so that it does not hurt when the eyelashes are born.
So when the eyelashes are born and engulfed, stop the mirror in the highest place, and place your hand over the eyelids of the cauterization, holding the finger that is according to the figure of a skull, and that is the beginning of the hold of the fingers.
Then make a cut through the skin and bladder in the wound or over the belly.
Then light the cautery of which this is the form of the fire.
Then cauterize over the figure that you have burned, little by little, in circular movements, until the surface of the cloth that is as tight as a shoe is charred, which appears quite naturally.
And if the safety of the work is that you see the eyelid of the belly being pulled back and the eyes of the patient being lifted, then make the puncture in the belly.
And then lift your hand and leave it there for three turns, and place the cut over the wound as soon as it is erected. And if you cure that as soon as it is healthy.
If the eyes return to their original state due to any cause and the eyelid is softened, then make another cut over there as it was at first.
If the eyes are in the eyelid now, then make another cut over there as it was at first, with the eyelids raised to the natural location and closed so that the eyes do not pull on the wound.
May's cauterization is medicine that burns this which commands the thigh that hears the eyes that are prolonged and engulfed, and it is usually made in the form of a sheet of paper like the beak of a swan.
When there is pain in the abdomen caused by live coals and fire, and if you want to reduce it immediately, and mix those causes with water and make it a poultice so that it does not become wet; and expand that poultice over the sheet that is made in the shape of a cat's ear, and place the hazelnut on the other end of the thigh; and place the thigh with the intestine in the album of the hurt part, and the head of the abdomen should be near the top.
And pause the medicine and give it to that little one who is not yet sick, so that the patient feels the taste of the medicine, which is in its form like fire.
And when you perceive that the patient does not like the taste of the medicine, give it to him again and wet that one with the same medicine; then when the taste ceases, take out the medicine with clean water; and consider if the eyelid has been washed with the same medicine as the water is hot or cold, which is the best; and if not, apply the medicine over the place where it has not been washed with the medicine and does not dry out because of your operation and does not contradict the hazelnut.
And keep your hand on the chest until the spasm of the cough is over, and then care for it with something warm or another as soon as it is healed.

Of cauterization of the fistula that is in the tear duct of the eye.
When you are treating a fistula with gout that has been diagnosed in the divisions of diseases and does not confirm your treatment, then you should cauterize the second point on this manicure: command the patient to place their head in their foot, and hold their head by an attendant between their feet in such a way that it is not awkward or agitated for the head.
Then stop cutting on the tongue of the gout or on the placenta of the flesh of the intestine.
Then recognize the cautery that this is the form:
The which is cavity, how it is like a cane or a pen of the volt, from one end to the other where the cauterization is made.
And if you see, it should penetrate into the other end. And if you want to be as it attempts.
However, that which is cured is better than the second work.
And if you open the fistula, and then take out the sore and dry that. If it is not opened, then you should open it and remove the wound of the patient.
Then place the cautery over the patient, the one that is not lit, and take a small piece of the cautery from the horse's tail at the end, so that your hand does not burn and the mare does not get upset, and you should stop the cauterization in the gray of the horse's tail and corrupt that.
And if the beginning of the cauterization goes into the bone, then it is; and otherwise, you should repeat the cauterization once or twice, according to your skill; and let that stay for three days, and place your hand over it with a border and surround it with something that dries it out, so that it becomes healthy.
If it was not cured in three days, then you should stop the acute, corrosive medicine and place your hand over the bone when it is discovered and is rough, according to what is recommended in the capital.
And there is another way of cauterizing the fistula: go to the location of the fistula and then open it and place your hand in that small fissure, subtle where the form of the fistula is; and then put in that the quantity of one and a half inches of plough fundut; and take your hand and have good retention, and do not make the mare uncomfortable because the plough fundut does not reach the horse's tail of that; and cover that with your hand over the horse's tail coto enfused in album or water, four plough adhere to the location of the fistula and it becomes healthy.

Chapter 21.
Of the use of cauterization for tooth pain.
When tooth pain is caused by coldness, or if it is caused by wind, or if the remedy does not improve the condition, you should cauterize in two places: either with cow dung, or with fire.
Cauterization with cow dung involves taking cow dung and burning it in a pig iron pan, and then cutting and wrapping it around the extremity of the tongue, and pressing it firmly against the painful tooth until it becomes cool.
And repeat this several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you have lana or a blade, dip it in the cow dung and place it on the tooth, and place it on the fire that is lit until the fire reaches the gum of the tooth.
However, the cauterization is not effective if you do not pay attention to the part that is inflamed or the sharpness of the focus, and the heat does not reach the mouth of the wound.
And accordingly, the doctor will choose the form of the cauterization and place it on the tooth and touch it with the burning cauterization; and he will make some cuts so that the pain remains or is reduced on that day or the next day.
And it is believed that with the pressure of this cauterization, the patient's mouth will open wide and hold it for an hour and remove the cushion; and this is the form of cauterization.

If the frostbite is small, stop the cauterization according to the amount of frostbite, and then apply it for three days and remove it from the affected area if it becomes inflamed as much as that which the fire has burned.

And be careful not to arrive at the cauterization of the gallbladder or burning of the neck, but only a little.
And if you cauterize that point, then you must also cauterize the joint of the collarbone in the corresponding spine of the neck. And the cautery of this wound should be made in the same way as before.
And then, after it has been treated as before, it will become healthy again.

When you do not understand the purpose of the cautery tool.
If the amount of water that is being applied is not adjusted to the size of the specific area of the intestine, and if the thigh is resting on the patient's foot; and if it is not, then there may be inflammation, which has already extended its fingers, and lift up the patient's breasts.
And can you possibly use this cautery as a cauterizing tool, with your subtlety and prudence in the art?
And do not rush in the cauterization process, and apply it to the entire intestine so that it is completely throughout the body and penetrates into the abdomen, where the intestine is subtle; and you know how.

Of the puncture of the abscess of the patient with cauterization.
When an abscess appears in the patient and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh or in the skin, then if it is in the flesh, the thigh becomes more serious and painful.
If the pain is in the patient's shirt, then it is usually a sharp and frequent pain that has already exhausted the doctor's ability to treat the patient.
Therefore, the thigh should be turned over on the table; and approximately mark the location of the hernia that is to be treated; and approximately insert the cautery in the form that was previously described on the other page. And when the cautery is inserted, it should be done when the entire abdomen has been burned, when it reaches the umbilicus, and when it reaches the intestine.
And it should be treated by curing the other hernias when it is healthy.
However, this method of cauterization should not be used unless the doctor has studied this in the art of medicine and has treated many patients with similar conditions; rather, this is an experiment that some have reported to be very painful about this operation, but it is necessary for us and it is useful.

And the depth of the cauterization is appropriate for the spiculum of the ribs.

When humors become moist and inflamed in the ankle part, and they cause the tightening of the joint, and it is said that the thigh is prolonged over the other when compared to it. And the location of the dislocation becomes thin in the other leg.
When you are about to cauterize the thigh over the ankle of the piece with the cauterizing iron, make sure you have the handle in your hand as if you were about to touch the area, and for that, the part should be in the middle of the circle.
And it is the cauterization that precedes the form in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cauterization is not at your disposal, you can cauterize that with the cauterizing iron of great olive.
And it is the cauterization according to the amount of the spiciness of the whole codena; and then cure that which is become healthy.
Chapter 41.
Of the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the ankle part, and the cause is the cold and dryness of the vessel, the thigh is treated as if they have said and not confirmed it, and this is antiquated, you should know that you release the thigh from the large humors with either pills made or artificial or resembling pills; and then cauterize that.
And the hand of the cauterization is placed in the second position: either the cauterization is made by physicians with burning irons, or by fire.
Second position of scientific hands, among which one is the one that cauterizes over the part of the thigh bone of the patient, and makes three cuts in this way; and it is good for that depth. And the space between each cauterization is the amount of its size and whether it is made with a thin or thick iron.
Sometimes some cauterizations are made over the middle of the neck for four reasons, which are four cauterizations.
And if you want, make cauterizations on the circle that is preceded by the form in the cauterization of the dislocation of the knee, and that it is a continuous and burning circle, and penetrates into the entire column.
And this is the hand of cauterization in the case when pain is attached to the knee and does not extend within the thigh.
And if it is extended within the thigh, make cauterizations on both sides of the thigh over the location where the pain comes from, and make one cauterization on the incision for four drachms of a little part of the collar.
If the cautery is sharp, and the depth of the cautery depends on the amount of the spiculum of the gallbladder.
If the gallbladder is enlarged and the pain extends to the area around the foot, then cauterize that part where it is enlarged with a cautery by three or four or more points if directed by that.
If the gallbladder is enlarged and the pain extends to the thigh, then cauterize that part with a sharp cautery.
Always keep in mind that during cauterization, do not use the cautery as a burning nerve or large artery, and for this reason, you may cause harm to the gallbladder or constriction.
And you have already seen one and another of those that were cauterized on the cavity and after in the cauterization, and the fire inside was inflamed throughout the tumor achieved to the foot, and the fire was perforated and corrupted the entire foot. And an excessive solution of the stomach is likely to cause death.
If the pain is in two parts, each part is cauterized with this point.
And the wise ones advise in the cauterization of this kind of cauterization: make it resemble a circle of iron of which the circumference is the largest part of a palm; and it should be the size of an orifice according to the largest part of a tooth or a little less.
And the circle is another part; and it is the space that is between them in the quantity of their notches; and those circles are opened by two parts; and the length of those circles is a notch or two notches, and make the margins of the iron slightly visible in the circles; and this is the form of it:
Then it should be lit in the fire when it is wrapped and gives off sparks, and it should be placed over the joint of the foot, the thigh covered on the lap. And this is cauterized with three points on a line.
And it is dressed with three layers; and it is wrapped around the border and kept moist for several days; and it is cared for that it becomes healthy.
Here comes the translation of the first source sentence:
When the doctor uses hot iron points on the patient who suffers, and burns them in that place.
When making incisions, it is said that you must make two circles with perforated armilla, where the throat of the gate of iron is; the length of the sides in the abdomen of them are two noses or as those.
And if the space that is between them of the quantity of the thickness of the same; and they are opened further and further, and they contain something between them according to this form:
And place your hand over the part of the ankle, and compress the tube on the part of the ankle; and take water from the tail and pour it between two circles, and that quality of that is as if by a small fire, and through that suffering the masturbation and the adustion of you — that masturbation stops when the masturbation ceases.
And raise your hand over the water and clean the water tail from all the ankle with water.
When the patient lies down for three hours and rests on that border where the navel of the remainder is located, and then stands up for a few minutes, and runs around the area; this is beneficial for the body.
And treat that part as if it were sick.
And if the pain is extended to the thigh or leg, make that statue in it which contains water according to what is done in the navel engagement.
This is the mania of the water tail, and I have already written this in the book of the rectification of medicines. Recipe for alkali and acid that is not extinguished in one part, and cut it into another wave of the same quality as the part that is left with a small hole, according to the quantity that enters in the ring.
And cut the end of the other wave, and put over that live alkali and acid water twice the amount that requires it for a day, and understand that these are good for the headache that leaves the water in the wave carried by the hand, and press the water that comes out of the cold water in the part that is left in the wave carried by the hand.
And adjust all that water to that amount, and add some more live and other alkaline substances, so that that part has strong acuteness, which is maintained in the operations of medicine and cauterization of other parts, which operation is like fire.
And some of the medicines are some that are cauterized wide, such as tea tree oil and honey anacrat, and they cause a sabore in us that they are mixed.
And Guilia reports of a man from ancient times about the operation and cure of a disease in which he was cured of pain in the knee and sciatica, and magnifies the merit of that, and says that no other cure is needed, and it is cured by a bath as recommended, where that intestine is in bath and eyes see what is from that.
And if it is near to a certain herb, and if not green, then the recent fig is caught; and more often than not, it is twisted with a little of gray and placed on the ankle where the pain is, or in the thigh, or in the chest, and it is seen.
When the pain is felt for three hours or according to the amount of fatigue that the evacuation causes.
When the body of the patient is wrapped in bandages, and the body of the patient becomes wrapped, enter that into the ground, and the pain ceases and is healed.
You already know that it is not necessary to use cauterization in these medicines except for the removal of the chest.
Mays already knows that when a sheep's bladder is used to constrict the vein and it is cauterized, it should be done with great care; and this is how the cauterization should be done: the lana should be held and the oli antic should be wetted, and it should be placed between the toes of the foot and between the fossils.
And if you take a dry sheep's bladder and burn it inside the joint that is causing pain, and place it over the lana and press on the entrance that is being stretched, then... And continue doing this, and do not stop until the tingling sensation of the biting spreads into the knee and stops the pain.
This method of cauterization is called cauterization of sheep's bladders.

Of cauterization for the pain of two.
Some pain is in the two due to multiple causes, such as inflammation or puncture or over-evacuation, and for causes similar to those, by infusion of wet and humid matter.
When cauterization is not done in this specific case, which is caused by the effusion of free matter.
Then, the evacuation of the foot is done with pillars fitted according to its shape and appearance, which are points on either side of it, following the third line at the latitude of the foot, as if you had to cauterize or cut in each line, according to the tolerance of the foot and the virtue of the patient.
And this is cauterization, done with a pointed cautery.
If you want, cauterize with three or four points, or with one point on the median clavicle according to this form:
Capital, Chapter 33.
Regarding the beginning of cauterization with gilbositat.
Observations have been made on this foot of the small children; and since the beginning of it in the children, it has caused an increase in their structure in the knee and the elevation and movement.
And wasting has been observed on the outer side of the spine of the foot and of the toes that begins to overburden the other spines.
When you see this and want to stop it, you should burn that point with the pointed cautery that follows this form: that holds the cautery on the entire side of the spine of the hernia.
And if you want, burn in the circuit of the spine with the cautery of two or three points. And the points are placed between them.
And then cure the area that is said to be healthy with this.
May you keep in mind that the cautery should not be administered in a yellowish tint, which is a spasm of the nerves.
Chapter 45.
Of cautery for gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And then how is gout treated by the cause of cold and not to worsen the pain, you should make the cautery.
When you have cauterized that appropriate discharge in the circuit of the joint of the foot, it is necessary to apply a poultice.
And is this the form of the olive oil for this cauterization?
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pain arises in the nearby joints or other joints, and it moves to the entire part of this cauterized olive oil, then you should cauterize that on each joint with three or four points of this cauterized olive oil.
And if these cauterizations are necessary for you, then cauterize that and do not press too much with your hand on the cauterization before, just so simply around the specific area.
And if the pain arises in the knee and elbow, then administer the cauterization that was told in the capital.
If the pain is in many places and it is called sugar, then you should make points on the circumference of the fingers as they rotate, make points on those two lines.
If the pain persists in these parts, then make points around the fire of the nails on each toe and on the tip of the toe.
If the pain worsens in the ankles or muscles, then cauterize all parts of the helper's joints.
And do not remove the patient from good regimen and reception of medicines, for if it is in good condition and unhealthy, this cauterization will be harmful, may God help.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization of wounds.
When the wound is in the ankles and the intestines protrude from the hernia, and then it begins with this, you must order the patient to eat less on that day and use gentle means for that the fence of the belly may not protrude.
And follow the patient with your hands on the belly side, and order him to hold the belly as if it is getting or appears to be herniated or the intestines.
And then return that to the thighs as you have attempted to break it over the bones of the patellar tendon and mark the end of which appears to be the circle of the gout at the subcutaneous parts of the body.
And then ignite the cauterization that is this form of it:
Enter if it is a red and sharp needle. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And then pause the cauterization over that mark you have made with your needle, and if you enter that you can see the patellar tendon within the thigh; and repeat it on another side if you have not succeeded in the first attempt within the bone.
And carefully observe the swelling of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, that you do not burn that intestine because it does not come out of the thigh or other great harm.
When you know that when you touch the cautery, do not pay attention to the bones, do not confirm your operation.
When the cauterization of children is done with great care and according to their size.
And take care of the area of the cauterization for three days, making sure that the wound does not become worse.
And take care of them with the other remedies within three days if they become healthy.
And the wound should be covered with a damp cloth for fourteen days until it is closed and clean.
And make sure to stop the nutrition according to the length of time the cure takes for the patient's stomach, and that the intestine does not come out due to the effort of healing.
And when you want to leave for fourteen days, give them appropriate care, and hold them for another fourteen days.
And it is important to work and eat well and drink water, and take strong medications, when you use this entire regimen of therapy for your health to become healthy.
And you direct the cure of the ruptures in other parts of the stomach, and so at the beginning, and you want that they do not go out, cauterize the rupture of that with the same cauterization according to the quantity of it, and it is important that it is exhumed from the codena as the last part of the stomach; and take care of that which has been said and do not adjust.
When the first wound was made, it was cauterized with a triangular cautery, as this form is more suitable for the wound.
Then a line is placed perpendicular to the wound's edge, and another line above it; then pause your hand and use a clavicle cauterization needle instead of the first one, which was placed further away and better.
Capital, Chapter 66.
Of cauterization of torsion.
When pain persists in any member due to tightening or striking and does not relieve for a long time and does not satisfy the doctor's treatment, it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And the cauterization of each member should be according to its size and thickness, as well as its veins and twists, and the location of the torsion and pain in the member.
If the wound heals with the first cauterization, stop; and if not, continue with the cauterization. Four out of five punctures are usually on the member that is closest to the one being treated, so you can reach those with the pointed cautery when the wound is healed.

This line translates to "Of cauterization of leprosy." However, without the context of the entire treat
This line translates to "Some leeches are some times used for great benefit, and management if the leprosy which is made by putrefaction of flax and melancholy." However, this translation is quite literal and may not make perfect sense in English. The original text might be using medical jargon or metaphors that are not clear without additional context.
This line translates to "And when you want to cauterize that, consider if the leprosy is crusted and has been cured as they say in the division and not done, nor done, and fears about the thigh that the corruption comprehends the whole body of him and all the collection of him, then cauterize that on the head with a piece of leather: one in the middle of the head, and one further away from him, and press it towards the end of the hair; and add two more pieces of leather; and one last one, behind the neck or on the shoulder." This line seems to be providing detailed instructions for cauterization of leprosy, which is a practice that is not commonly used in modern medicine. It's important to note that this translation is based on a literal interpretation of the text and may not capture the full meaning or context of the original.
When the last point is made, a little pressure is applied to the bone, and the intestines are displaced, so that the expiration of large vapors is relieved from the body; then cauterize on the table as desired.
If leprosy has already expanded over the thigh and manifestly appears, you should cover that with a cauterization point; and cauterize on the tip of the nose, and two on the upper lip, and two on the lower lip, and two on the two shoulder blades, and one on each shoulder, and one over the two hip bones, and one over the hip, and two over the knees, and two over the thigh muscles, and two over the tendons of the thigh; cauterize all the joints of the teeth and toes of the upper limbs and the lower limbs, and on each toe of the feet.
And keep away from the nerves that are over the sole that you do not burn.
When some joints are cauterized with a cautery on the bones of the patellar tendon and on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the anus, it is customary to do so.
Know that the fewer times you cauterize, the less beneficial and less effective it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain in the cauterization, just as they had before, because the body of the patient has already become numb.
And know that the cauterizations are large or small according to the members and joints, according to which species of tools precede them.
And properly care for the cauterization with flour of earth, honey, and the other cure, according to whether it is healthy or not.

Of Cauterization for Stunned Patients.
When a member is stunned or falls asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and does not become healthy, then you should cauterize that stunned member according to the size of the member or its slenderness.
When the sharp cautery is inserted into the abdominal wall, a few centimeters. And apply this remedy to the affected part when it is cured.
And sometimes the cautery is applied to a certain part that eventually goes to the bones of the feet, spine, and nerves that move that member, and the swelling is reduced.
This should not be applied to anything except what is known about the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves that move all the members of the body.

Of cauterization of tumors that are cancerous.
When the tumor is old and does not respond to the remedies of medicine, then apply the cautery over that part with a sharp cautery a few centimeters after the quantity of the abdominal wall has been reduced, and the color of the member has changed.
And apply this remedy made of flour and lentils mixed with rose oil and arngos leaves, and with saffron or with iron, to each part and they are all mixed together, and place a bandage on it and hold it in place until it is cured.

Of cauterization of adhesives.
When some adhesives are delayed in maturation, and it is due to the superfluity of something, or the state of the body, which is old and thin, or for time, and you want to accelerate the maturation of adhesives; then cauterize at the end of that part with a small point; and apply it there so that it dries in maturation.
If you want to drill the cautery, then you know the cauterization of this kind: and slow it down in the middle location of the adhesive as soon as the needle penetrates the coden.
If the cauterization is done in that place where it was placed earlier, so that the heart of the arm is relieved; and if careful attention is given to that area which is healing.

De cauterizacio de corrodent, or "Of the cauterization of corrosives," is
Corrodent are wandering corrupts in the body that corrode the flesh as fire consumes dry wood.
If you see that corrosive in that place where it suffered cauterization by fire, then you should use few cauterizing irons and larger ones as needed in that place where the corrosion occurs.
And if you cauterize that from all parts within which you eradicate the entire corrosion and do not leave any cause of it.
And let it be for three days, and then place your hand over the cauterized spots every few hours until all the wounds are completely healed and the corrosion is completely eliminated.
And if you care for that, may it generate flesh.
When the flesh has healed three times in the area where it does not become corrupt, that is sufficient; otherwise, you should repeat the cauterization over the area that is rising in the corrupted areas.
When some cold humors attack a person, it is customary to treat them with a cut or cauterization at that location. However, cauterization should be performed as gently as possible for the patient's well-being.
And I have already spoken of the treatment of the patient in the division, and therefore take that when the end is near.

Chapter XXXIII: Of cauterization of galls and the like.
Galls that are visible on the surface of the foot of the diseased leg, which is called gout, and causes it to swell, ooze, and affect the leg; and cauterization is performed on those with two hands, either with hot iron or with a caustic plant.
However, cauterization with hot iron is similar to a burn, which is made by heating the iron according to the quantity of the gall contained in each part, and it is done with fine points.
And then stop the heat on the gall, and then roll your hand over the cauterization in the circuit of the gall, until that cauterization reaches the depth of the gall. When a person has a hard lump (called a gallstone) in their gallbladder, it can cause severe pain in the upper right part of the abdomen. This pain is often mist If the person has a hard lump (called a gallstone) in their gallbladder, it can cause severe pain in the upper right part of the abdomen.

This pain is often mistaken for other conditions, but if left untreated, it can lead to serious complications such as perforation of the gallbladder or pancreatitis. To treat a gallstone, doctors may recommend medications to relieve pain and reduce inflammation, or they may perform a procedure called cholecystectomy, where the gallbladder is removed through a small incision in the abdomen. After the surgery, patients are usually given pain medication and advised to rest for several days to allow the body to heal. In some cases, additional treatment may be needed to prevent future gallstones from forming.

The danger of cauterization on the chest.
When inflammation occurs in the chest, and pustules appear that are caused by grossly corrupt materials; then at the beginning, it is best to cauterize over the entire opening of the cautery with a fine cautery under the skin, or with long-term erosion; or with slow cauterization.
And sometimes, when the inflammation is at its beginning of expulsion, it is cauterized immediately after this manner; and it is not uncommon, and the excess is broken into those parts, and they become healthy.
However, it is believed that this is proper for evacuation by flebitomy.

The danger of cauterization of sweat from a wound caused by an incision of the arch.
When troops are seen flowing from the arch, which is inflamed by the plague that destroys it, or must be made with the incision of apostemas or cauterization of the member, and then seem to disappear, it is difficult to remain in that state.
When one is suffering from gout, you should cut the skin at that place and apply it to the orifice of the artery, and then place it over that which has been exposed to the veins entering that part where the flow of the sinus was, and that does not want to come out.
Then pause the cautery olive oil a few and many, by name, and exhale over those that are not yet ignited.
And take from those a little or a great part of the location and press on that which is about to rupture the artery, over that strong vein which will remain firm in the one that has been exposed and rested, and then cauterize it so that it is compressed and held tight by the sinus.
And if the sinus is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you hold the one that has been exposed and remove the cauterization, then take another sharp cautery from those which are prepared in the fire, and do not stop doing this until the sinus is tightened again.
And remember that you do not burn the nerves that are here, and that will come over the other malice.
1. You know that when the artery flows through a narrow passage, it is impossible to restrict it, especially when the artery is large, and more so if it is not one of four manieyras: if it is cauterized as said, or if it is extracted when it is not extracted, or if it is extracted when the extremities of the veins are burned and the sac is restricted, or if it is stretched over the medicines of which the virtue is to restrict the sac; and they are strengthened by the pulvinar and constrained by decency.
This sentence is discussing the administration of restrictions to a patient's limbs or body parts due to certain conditions. It states that those who administer such restrictions should not cause discomfort, but rather provide relief. The term "tart" in this context may be a misspelling or archaic term for "comfortable" or "ease.
If no doctor or midwife is present and you must do it yourself, open the incision on the vein as they have said, and understand the great pressure that the blood has within the dead part of the plague, and over the artery, the point is not sore; and over the artery, apply water with great coldness entering if the sanc is congealed and compressed; and do not worry if it needs cauterization or medicine.
Of incision, perforation, and ventosae, and of plagues and their like.
As has been said in the first book of all maladies where cauterization is convenient and necessary, and the occasions and causes of it, and the instruments needed for the forms of cauterizations; and I have ordered the chapters of the subcutaneous flesh among the feet.
And your procedure in this chapter for that purpose, so that the one who wants it may be satisfied, and you do what is required on that matter.
When you begin this work, son, remember that in this capital there is fear for you that it is in the first capital of cauterization.
For that reason, it is necessary to exercise great caution in this operation, as in this capital motas veguadas catz evacuacio the one that is am sanc am le qual esta la vita deves la aspersio de la vena or incisio sobre l'apostema or apercio of exsitura or puracio of the plagua or extraccio of sageta or incizio de peyra and their appearances. When all those things are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in the most of them the death is the end.
I warn you that on you do not fall into gout in the case of any difficulty, for some hands you will need to use the hands of other men who have experienced similar difficulties. And of them it is said that if you go to their malady and you do not heal them, and because of the severity of this malady that finds in their malady, and because of the long duration of their malady, and they die from the malady that means death.
And of those it is said to you what gives you the power and knowledge, that you expect from that cure, and the dangerous malady is pernicious.
And therefore do not consent in the one who shows you the hand of that which is this manieyra; and your caution be greater than required and your rapaciousness; and do not presume any cause over it except a certain science known to you, and by which this knowledge is verified to you, and which succeeds in praiseworthy success.
The following text is a medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish and French as well. Try to guess what the text means and translate it line by line into English like this:
O, children, may God give you understanding and not leave you without direction and protection, for this is in your own hands.
You and I order this chapter to distinguish by chapters following this one in the chapter of cauterizations, of the care of the foot within the feet, so that you can be fully satisfied with what you asked and of which there is need.
The first line of the text is "Capitol primier.
Of the cure of water that is contained in the head of the child.
You know that this disease is seen in children and you must give them the treatment and when the nurse shaves the child's head, his life will be saved.
And some are seen because of a wound that is not cleaned.
I have not seen this disease but in children; and of all those that I saw who were in danger of death, and for this reason I have seen many operations in them.
And I have seen a child whose head was full of water, and his head was very magnificent until he could no longer hold it, because of the greatness of the head of the child, and less because of the moisture that was increased when the fire died.
And this water is either added between the ribs and the bone, or it is added after the bones are placed on the chest.
Then, if the water is between the ribs and the bone and the application is little, you must cut in the middle of the head of the child with a small fissure in the latitude, and the length of the fissure is two notches within which the water runs, and this is the form of the spatulum:
If humidity increases and the gout becomes more severe, then you should make two incisions in this manner:
If the humidity is on the bones, then you should see the commissures of the hair growing out of all parts and the sweat is flowing when you understand that this is not the end of your pain but only the beginning of it. Cover that you cut in the middle of the head with three slits according to this method:
And cut the extrated scar through all the humidity; and stretch the slits on both sides and plump them; and cover it over with a cloth and put olive oil in it for five days, and care for the wound you have made and engorge it, and tighten the cap equally; and eat the dry food that is in the member until it is comfortable and healthy.
And another method of incision is considered more effective, which takes into account the size of the abscess and the collection of sweat, where some wounds are less in the occipital region, or in the part that comes down, or on the right, or on the left; and then pay attention to the incision where the abscess and the repletion of sweat appear, and follow what is most possible for you.
You should observe whether the artery is not torn and does not cause any bleeding, as it may cause the patient's leg to swell due to that flow of blood.
Capitulum tertium.
When you cut the gallbladder or spleen near the hips or chest, and it is not usually done, and no cure is given by that method, then the same cure should be used in this case of those two arteries.
And when you want to cut those that the patient wants, and cover the place with something rough as the drap, and support the neck of the leg with an ax; and consider where the vein is located; and the places of each over the places that are nearest to the ears, and they are hidden so much in other men's bodies.
And cover the artery that you intend to cut, and cut each one of them with the edge of the knife, and make it go inside the bone, and let it be so that the angle is at the top of the head.
If you want, enter the artery with the thumb and guide it to the parts where it needs to be.
And if the length of the incision is two fingers and a half, then when any vein is cut, the sand will be ejected with an escape pulse, which deforges by frequent pulsation.
If the artery does not appear in the constriction, you must measure the abdomen of the amount of space three fingers, and then try to enter the bone.
And it is believed that the sand gets the amount of vi unc., and more than that, or less, and then it follows the quantity that appears of the beauty of the thigh and the removal of the artery from the patient.
And if you consider the plague, and then if any cause of the cyst remains on the bone, you should incise there so that it does not come to apothem cautery.
And you stretch the plague with plums and limbs, and you care for that if it is cured inside that it is healthy.
I apologize, but the provided text is not in a language
The following line appears to be in Spanish and can be translated as: "From the extraction of the arteries that are in the templates." However, without additional context, it is
The following line appears to be in Spanish and can be translated as: "When an old wound or catarrh is present, due to the humors of the body and their quality in the legs, or an old scar appears similar to these, and it is treated with the tools of curative medicine, but it does not relieve, we have found in these maladies extraction of arteries from the templates, or cauterization of those parts that have shown.
The instrument of the operation and extraction of those is what the evil race of the feet provides for the toes; and understand the apparent arc in the template that it is shown by your hand, and it is hidden except in a few people by the force of cold.
If it is hidden from you, the thigh of the evil race is strong at some part; and instead of cold, make sure to have a dry or wet place at the location where the arc appears to you as clearly as possible. And take the substance of which this is the form: And burn the cord at that point for ease of entry into the arc; and then get out of it and extract that from the parts behind it when you extract it from the cord and discover those of the tunics that are behind it, in total.
If the artery is thin, wrap that around the end of the ring, and then inscribe one part after another according to the quantity by which the extremities of the vein are tied and are contracted, and it will not cause a leak of sweat, for if they are not inscribed, the sweat will not flow from all.
When expelling the urine of a man, enter three times.
If the artery is large, you should cover that with two pieces of cloth or strings that are doubled and not too tight, and do not leave it on until the putrefaction has passed through the consolidation of the plague and the evacuation of pus.
And then, if possible, reduce the superfluity that is between two limbs; and do so at that time or at another time.
And if you want, cauterize that with a pointed cautery within the bone that is cauterized, and keep it within the cuticle when the extramits are incised, and stay in place of that work.
And it is better work if the patient does not have fever or is not in an advanced state of sepsis; for cauterization is of those causes that help to reduce moisture, and therefore it is better in its youth.
And cover the extraction of the arteries that are coming out of the old loculus, and place them over the polvils decently made, and then apply it as a curative measure to the medicines that make the flesh grow better and the calves enter when they are healthy.
When you are working on another vein that is bleeding from the artery, if you touch that artery, or with cauterization, or by pressing on the area to hold it tight, and stretch it inside so that the artery is held tightly. If the cause of that is not present to you, then stop on the place where the artery is tightened, and close the place with something wet and cool, and make it stronger after the sharpness has healed, and it will be stronger afterwards.
If you are doing an extractions of the artery, it is that you cauterize the vein with this cauterization that has two points, pushed that you have seen the two loci, and stops quick, but not too much, inside that if they reach the bone and separate the vein in two parts, so that it is elongated as much as possible, that no parts are not held by everything of this cauterization.
This is the form of the cauterization:
And the sharpness of both points is an example. When however the pain is sharp and better than two punctures, then if the pain is sharp and soon comes to the flesh of the foot, and does not pass quickly, it is necessary to make a point in the flesh of the foot.
And when there is any swelling, the heat of the fire is held in those places and the flesh is slowly cut off.
And this work is better than all works and leaves little room for improvement.
And the space between two punctures is the amount of swelling of the said.

Of the cure of the chest of sharp and acidic gout of the heels.
When the gout of the heels is sharp and acidic, and the chest of those veins which are over the test of the skull, and do not comfort in any cause of medicine, and sometimes the face of the foot becomes erect and stands up as if it were the front of a walker, and the heels become extenuated, they become humid like when their nails were new, and the toes are scalped by the sharpness of the tears, the old smells in the cure of this operation, and the name of this cure is far.
And it is that you command the patient to cut off the hair that is on the top of his head, and insert three incisions into the forehead, separated by a distance equal to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the incision is two inches, the first incision should be engulfing far from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly after the movement of the eyelids that are on the eyelid, and the third part.
And keep an eye on the incision of the arches that are in two lanes, and extend your hand for the continuation of the teeth. And if the space of each incision is three inches adjusted.
And if you have a sponge pad or cloth that absorbs moisture for those that dehydrate the wound.
And place the sponge between two sharp edges, of which this is the form of the incision of the wound: that is from the beginning of the template to the second incision. When the entire coda is in pain that is between two cuts on the ribcage, and it migrates to the second cut, it is called gout by doctors. And if you want to go deeper into this wound and enter it with another hand, another instrument is needed, called a scalpel, sharp at one end and blunt at the other.
And pause the cut of that sharp part with the skin, and the cut of the other blunt one with the bone, and push that which has entered through the fissure back into its original position, and separate all those that descend from the head to the toes.
May it be continued until the cut is completed from the other end, and it may be entered into the other fissure.
And push that the amount of blood flows out, remove the knots of the sutures.
And stop in any fissure that has a thick horn, and stay over those powders that are full of oil and vinegar, and see that it does not cause an abscess.
And on the third day, remove the bandage and give a large infusion of water or serum, and treat that which is engorged with mercury, olive oil, and other substances that are used to cure the plagues that have been cured.

When cold humors accumulate in the feet and continue to worsen, and the legs become thin, and their eyes are ulcerated and the hair is lost, and in the prepuce of the penis there is acute pain and extensive tearing, you should know that these accidents happen due to the materials and humors not entering but through the veins of the parts dependent on the legs.
The best cure for this is to order the patient to lie down, and to insert a knife into the front of the thigh, making a small incision in the middle of the forehead, starting from the medial side of the right temple (and continuing along the fissure of the left temple); and insert it into the bone; and extend it into the joints of the fingers that are not covered by the mustache; when it reaches the bone, stop.
Wipe dry all the remaining moisture with a clean cloth or sheet, and place it between the two sides of the fissure of the cut or wound. And if you find that the wound is not closing, use poultices made of herbs and oil to prevent infection.
And when you see that the abscess has decreased, cover the wound with a cloth made of herbs and oil to prevent infection. Then treat the abscess with a paste made of flour and colloquium four parts and one part, and mix them together, and apply it to this disease on the native flesh.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided text does not contain
The translation of "De la cura de aquo que catz en las aurelhas" is: "Of the cure for this gout that sets in the
The translation of "Tota causa que catz en las aurelhas es una de quatre specias, quar o es peyra mineral o causa semblant a peyra, ayssi cum ferr e veyre, o es de planta ayssi cum ceze o fava, o es causa fluxtibla ayssi cum aygua e vi agre e a lor semblantz, o alcuna bestia." is: "The cause that gout sets in the joints is one of four species, which are either mineral pebbles or resemble mineral pebbles, like iron and steel, or are of plant origin like clover or fennel, or are a cause of fluxion like water and its semblance, or some animal.
The translation of "E donc quan peyra catz en l’aurelha o autra causa semblant de aquelas causas que no ajustan ne creysso en l’aurelha, e pausa la aurelha al solelh, e si vezes la peyra, lahoras distilla en aquela alcuna causa de oli violat o sizami, e aprop aministra la extraccio de lu, e fay le stornudar am condizi, e oppila las nars deve le aveniment de stornutacio." is: "And when gout sets in the joint or another cause resembling those causes that do not fit or are not believed in the joint, and stop the joint to the sun, and if it sometimes shows the peyra, distill the olive oil or slime of that one particular cause of the stornutacio, and administer the extraction of the stornutacio, and make the patient feel better about the stornutacio, and allow the patients to see the outcome of the stornutacio. And then pause at the circuit of the ear some pieces of wool or linen, and extend the earflap to the parts thereof, as many turns as possible, without forgetting these causes.
If there is no bleeding, you should administer an extraction from the part using the instrument called the epicicarious gesture, which is as follows:
If you forget the gesture, do not worry; and if not, you should administer the extraction from the part using this subtle and slight gesture:
If you do not forget this, then you should make a small incision in the arm and enter the end of the needle into the hole of the anus and close it with cera and olive oil to prevent the needle from being scratched until the needle: And if you extract from the upper part of the thigh, few women have encountered this as yet, according to what I know:
If you do not forget in this maneuver, you should hold the halka alumbat or the vech aparelhat in the part where the nails are pressing on the skin of a cat, and place it at the end of the ray, and then gently push over that corner: And if you insert it into the hole of the anus, it will be easier, and extricate the anus from the moisture:
If none of the causes are forgotten, which have been reported, then you cut at that point where it seems to go through the tendon or spasm.
The manicure of that is what you cut at the beginning of the vein of the sephalic saphenous and extracted from the second manicure of the virtue of the foot, and then close that cezer between your hands and convert the aurelha into parts of it, and if there is a small fissure in the edge of the aurelha you need to put the grease in the place where it is most needed. If there is a fissure of lunar figure within which it penetrates the foot, and if the foot is atrophied, remove that part as much as you can using appropriate instruments; and immediately close the fissure at that time with speed, and cure that within which is sane.
E if the cause is in the aurelha it is one of the greases that have been swollen and inflamed, then you administer the treatment and extraction of it; but if you do not obey your advice, then you need to hold the spumina under your thumb according to this form: When administering care to that abscess, take the one that is cut in the thigh.
Do not do this when you think that it has been moistened by the steam of the thigh, and pause there for a while, and take out those from the nails or hands, or from any other part where they have been inserted, and if you find that the extraction is difficult, then proceed as follows:
In the water that is inserted in the thigh, which the patient uses for sniffing, and fill the thigh with cold water, and place the water on the thigh where the abscess is, and if for some reason it is forgotten, then so be it; and if not, take a few hot stones and place them in the fire, and heat those in the patient's thigh, and the patient will insert one of those in the opening of the thigh and press it with another stone on the same part and press it with a hot stone on another part of the thigh. Do not stop doing this until all the water is forgotten.
Do not stop doing this until all the water is forgotten. When the urine is forgotten that you take from paper or cloth, and place one end of it in the anus and stretch the other end outside until it is dry, then it will be remembered again.
And if you use and another cloth and make as many loops as possible within the urine until all of it is forgotten, and then stretch that to the side where the extra urethral opening is said to be.
In the extraction of animals that enter the anus, if it is small, it can be pulled out with a gentle hand and according to its appearance, treat it as it has been said in division; but if it is large, one must administer the extraction of the head and testicles, and the cause of this is found in all the other causes that are seen in the anus.
In the extraction of worms that are born in the anus, when you treat that as directed in division and in the treatment of distillations and do not comfort your cure, then cover the anus with sunlight.
If here any cause of the gallstones appears, then extract that part with the greatest effort or with one's fingers, unless no cause is found, then take a needle and push it through until it comes out wide, this being the form of the gallstone: When the extreme part of the joint is entered into the hip according to the amount that suffers from the gout; and then it is given a little more force, and is made to move in a circular motion, until all the vertices are turned.
If you do not obey my instructions, then I will ask you to leave and close the circuit of the canula as we have said; then you should administer distillations of those that have already spread in the treatment of the vertices, and find it in the chapter of distillations.
And is your discharge that which funds the medicinal oils in the hip, this being the form of the same instrument by which this is done. And make that of silver or of gold, straightly, in which there is a small hole, and it will be easier to use.
And so be as it is inserted in the cavity of the canula of continuance here where necessary. And if you wish, take the ring and wrap it gently around the end of the canula slightly cotton, and place or oil in the concavity of the ear, or some herb, or that which you want of these medicines in the canula — and this is in the hip —, and then enter the ring into the hip and exhale from your mouth when the oil has been expelled in the concavity of the ear and the gout feels the oil.
When something is wrapped in the glove, it has already been cut open by a small focus. And you should know that the cause which is distilled in the glove is not too fragile, for the glove medicines do not suffer from this.
Capitulum VII.
Of the treatment of rheumatism in gloves.
Some people have observed that the rheumatism of the glove is caused by the intestines of previous generations being exposed to the wet or dry, and that this rheumatism has been found in men and women, causing pain in the meat of the glove due to inflammation or lack of nutrition; and some have observed that this rheumatism is caused by the opening of the wound of the glove that does not fit well, and some have been found in the parts that are deformed.
And if that which happens in the opening of the glove, which does not understand the fit, is found in the major parts of difficult treatment, it should be treated with great care.
And if you are able to understand the fit in that case, then you should place the glove of the thigh on the sun and look at that. If you sometimes see an apparent swelling, open that soft part of it, which is the form of the foot:
If the end of it is where the width is small, the part of which one part is sharp and the other is not; and the swelling is from two legs, the one does not cause pain to the ear.
And if the swelling is from flesh that is hard in the ear or in the foot, open that soft part with small points and press with great force until it is completely removed.
And if the swelling is in the front of the ear, press softly with a small point and heat that part for a little while, and then place it in the ear.
And if you have seen swelling in the foot that the thigh becomes difficult to open, due to heaviness of the limbs, try to press the oppression of the foot with difficulty; and do not hurt the nerves of the ear.
And stop in the ear the amount of air that you have blown into the Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the consolidation of the abscess; or if you take any and press it into wet clay and powder over it according to what you use, and if the ear is already inflamed, you should replace that which you have taken out and switch to another one that you blow into the ear which is red, within which the abscess is located; and take care of it until it is healthy.
If blood flows from a wound, submerge the sponge or cloth in clean water and place it over the wound, and use another cure that restricts the flow of blood, which is called in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Of the treatment of conjunctivitis, which ends in the eyes.
Conjunctivitis occurs in the eyes, which is caused by certain humors, and some are dry.
Therefore, you must have those hands or feet, and cut off the spots where the nails are, and place your hand over the parts that are sore.
If pain comes from the flow of blood, then you should cauterize those points with a sharp cautery.
And the best cauterization is when the incisions and sharp points return to the skin when any cause of the nails is removed; and when the cauterized hands are burned, those nails are consumed and do not return.
Chapter 9.
This appears to be a medieval medical treatise about treating inflammation or swelling in the eyelids, also known as "grandeyssa" in this context. Here's a line-
When visible veins appear in the eyelids, it is often due to a cause that results in swelling and inflammation in the eyelids, and this condition is called "grandeyssa.
When there is an addition of thick moisture in the eyelids and around the eyes.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider it necessary if the growth is coming from there in water that appears in the eyelid and is worse throughout; and the cause of this is unclear.
Therefore, pay attention to that wound in the latitude, and remove it from all parts as easily as possible, and suspend it over the fire and allow it to fall.
And if the figure is large, you adjust it with the suture; and care for that after it is healed.
And if it is small, you will not suffer much for that later when the anguish of the remaining part restores itself and becomes carnified.
And if the growth is declining in the parts of the eyelid, you must superficialize the edges, and then cover the growth with a piece of cloth, another that you ask for the beginning, and press it on all parts, and if the eyelid due to the wound is elongated, then it is not clear in any case.
When approaching the incision, wash the area with salty water; and care for the location that is clean inside where it should be healthy.
Chapter 10.
The cure for the swelling in the inner corner of the eye.
Swelling is caused by the one that is generated in the inner corner of the eye, and especially in children, it worsens the bags under the eyes and causes them to droop; and they cannot see the clearness of the sun because of this that makes them look sad.
And have you ever noticed that those eyes look sad all the time, and even when they are sleeping; and on their eyelids there are wet folds, which have already healed inflammation, and are prone to redness; and when you touch the location with your fingers, you feel redness in those.
And one of the operations that is done on the inner corner of the eye is to stop the blood vessels from coming out of the socket, and to stop the dryness of the eyelid and the redness, and make the circle according to the quantity that contains the calgua of the whole part, and to stop that over it and touch the eyelids with your fingers for the total that is added to the circle, and to add to that over it and touch the eyelids with your fingers for the total that is added to the circle, and to add to that over it and touch the eyelids with your fingers for the total that is added to the circle, and the fissure is not greater than the fissure that is made in ophthalmology.
When cutting the cloth before you arrive at the arcernach, remember that in the more recent processes, the arcernach is processed through a fissure according to the form of white grayseza.
Then extract those that you have folded between the thighs of the patient, according to the parts that are deformed and rolled between the right and left hands, after it is cut.
And remember not to adjust in the fissure because the sputum does not reach the hole and it will cause that.
If you do not see your arcernach at the beginning of the fissure, then adjust in the fissure a small ease after processing the arcernach; and extract those that have been said; and submerge the cloth in water and wet it, and put them over the place and stretch out those that are powdered.
And so that they do not cut the sal and leave it in the cavity of the fissure because that is what remains of that humidity.
And care for that after it is healed.
When you arrive at the site of the cautery wound, treat that area with ointments as soon as it is clean.
Capitol.xi. is not a complete sentence and does not
Of the fingers of the hand.
When the tips of the fingers are affected by the natural and antiquated adjustments, you should immediately cut off those parts of the finger and make ways for maladies that cause constant tears and softening of the eyelids and skin, which is called tactinir of the hand, and it can be treated in four ways: either by cauterization with fire; or by acute medicine as it is said in the capital of cauterization; or by cutting and suturing; or by cannas as you direct.
And so, please hold the foot's heel in your right hand; if it is converted, then so be it; and if not, make a small hole in that where the seam of the skin was on the inside of the eyelid, and insert the hole into the seam, and thus it will — the edge of the eyelid's margin where the fingers were — the fingers, and pull out the part from the edge of the eyelid, and convert it to the ray.
And in the part of the eyelid where the lashes are close to the incidence of the lacrimal major on the lacrimal groove; and then extract the eye and place the eyelid slightly open, and cover it over the eyelid that is closed, and see how it resembles a glowing ember.
But may I say that the figure is different according to the quantity of elevation of the eyelid, for it has been diversified among men, and out of those some are such that they require a great deal of elevation according to the amount by which the eyelid is softened.
And if you have placed something on the skin over the two lines that you have seen, and begin from the lacrimal major into the lacrimal minor. And if your incision is close to the natural lashes, it resembles the largest of the kings.
And place the nail in one of the two angles of the collar, and scrape it all, and adjust it to the curvature of the two lips of the mouth or the fur of the lash subtle, and remove the sand, and make it adhere if there are any excessive parts of the fur over two folds on some causes unseen, if you want to do this, and if not, do not care.
When it is necessary to close the incision of the testicles, do so within three or four days and take care of that.
If you want, close the wound with your suture, and take care of that which dries and constricts, and keep the eyelid closed until the plaster of the plague and its addition have healed; then remove the suture and proceed to the next stage.
However, in this case, there is concern about the thigh, and it is good for the operation, and not in fear.
And there is another method for dressing, and you should see the eyelid as if it were a piece of meat, and then raise the eyelid by three or four inches, separating it according to this form:
If it is not possible to do this, then keep the eyes closed, and do not touch them with your fingers. Then take a loop of thread and put it in the eyehole, and enter the other eye with the larger lacrimal, and the other with the smaller one, and adjust the eyes so that they are equal, and raise the upper eyelid according to what has been recommended, and lift the entire lid over the eyes.
And then adjust the holes of the plague's wound with a suture, and cure that entrance which is healthy.
When you suffer from an abscess, whether it is on your skin or in the flesh, apply this abscess remedy to that part and its appearance, and it will heal.
If some warts appear on the eyelid that have been converted into skin, then you should use that which has been said of the abscess remedy; a more natural suture is needed in those places.
Applying this form to cancers is second only to this method. And if you convert the eyelid and cut the figure that is next to it according to what I have reported; and as a rule, make cancers or small stones of those that are similar in length to the eyelid and in latitude to the latitude of the spathe. And if you have already closed the ends of each part, where you have the threads.
And add any subtlety that is superfluous to the abscess remedy of the eyelid, and constrict the cancers of each part with a firm structure, and lay it aside for later use, as the coda for the stricture will die and be rejected and become moist within it if it is inserted into the cavity.
If it is too late, you should cut off the tail of the boar, and properly care for the wound that has been made.
When the eye is healed, the eyelid is raised and the lashes do not scratch.
And this is the way to apply ointments that you make after this method: and it had the quantity of longitude and latitude, neither more nor less.
Chapter XII.
When the eyelid is raised, the lashes scratch because the eyelid is hard.
When the eyelids are artificial, hard and sharp, and the lashes scratch them, you perform the operation on it by taking a soft needle and placing it in that soft part of the neck, and then adjusting the ends of the eye and not the nose. And the longitude of the soft parts is about the size of a palm.
Then, you can add another soft part on top, and if you want, you can cut off the ends of that one.
Then, place the thigh in the most comfortable position, and it is suitable for the surgeon to declare that your work is a delicate and small operation.
When introducing the needle into the adjusted eye socket that requires an injection, make sure to push it in firmly through the eyelid until the desired part of the pelvis is reached.
Then pull the pelvis in and insert the needle through the hole, and it should be one or two or three needles at most.
Then pull the needle out that is inside the pelvis, making sure it is not stuck in the eyelid of the natural pelvis.
If you are not stuck in the eyelid and the pelvis is not stuck, pull the eyelid out at the parts further away from where the stitching was done, until the desired part of the pelvis is reached that has been stitched.
And when you have reached the desired part of the pelvis, pull out the needles and the stitching, and close the wound, and leave it for two or three days, until the pelvis adheres to its place and covers the good flesh.
And if the pelvis is not healing quickly, you may need to adjust a longer pelvis of the natural pelvis, and raise it up, or that one should be elevated within the space that it occupies, and then you will raise it.

The cure for a stye in the eyelid.
When a stye appears in the eyelid, and the eyelid contracts when pressed, either on the left or right side, due to poor consolidation of plague or cutis or cauterization, and this is called a hordeolum, and it can be natural or accidental, and it is made by consolidation of plague or cutis or cauterization, or by resemblance to them.
May the glove of the operation in it be that you press the consolidation and separate the labia from it, and place it there as soon as you find it between those two mechas of drap, and tie them when they are cured.
And you do not need to use cure for the cause that dries it out, as long as you return to the hordeolum with pus that has not been heated for any time.
Use on that cause that mollifies the skin as it is gently rubbed, and apply to the water in which the tears and semen of it are collected, or engage the vagina, the which is liquefied by the oil, and submerge that mecha in it, and cure that.
The first line of the translation is:
This operation, which has been described, is none other than a correction of the anal area by an excretory system that does not return the location to its original form.
The text you've provided appears to be a medieval medical treatise written in a
Of the treatment of eczema, which is caused on the eyelid.
This acne is made in the eyelid, which is naturally made of acne; and it is either natural or accidental.
It is more accidental due to plague, scission, cauterization, or other similar causes.
And the way of the operation is that you take a double-edged knife and put it in the flesh, and fix it in the flesh, and that the skin passes from the inner corner of the eye to the outer corner of the eye, across which the filament penetrates into the extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh to the parts where the knife is and cut it with the knife, and insert it into the sputum. And if you return the figure of the eyelid to its original shape, then so be it; otherwise, take the mirror and fix it in that position, and transform the eyelid, and close the other fissures in the corner of the eyelid.
And the ends of the other fissures of two angles of the incision are made, which you have made by converging, and that angle is made between them when they gather together.
This figure is written in Greek letters: the letter "lambda".
Then remove the skin of that part according to the quantity that the gout has left behind, so that the eyelid is not affected.
Then adjust the separated parts and sew them with the thread; and treat those that have been told about the softening medicines and the baths within which they were cured.
And if you use a cautery to close or suture or cauterize, you should know that you must place a flat cut over the eyelid edges according to what has been described. And separate the bath between two lips according to what has been said.
In the sum of the speech of the cure of the surgeon when it is done or removed, that runs in the operation, according to what has been prepared by the form of the surgeon, and that is in the form of different waves.
And the artificer saves all the time preparing an engine in each hand which is possible to enter when returning the figure to its natural form, or rather of that, and that malus according to what is convenient for the operation and the instruments in the larger possessions.

Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to some men who have solidified the eyelid with something inserted in it, and it has been prohibited from facilitating movement and their natural works, therefore you should enter the extraction of the eyelid from where it is inserted, and raise it upwards or extend it upwards.
And if you insert the adhesion of subtle sweat under it, which is not like the sharpness of the incisions, they have a little one so that the thigh does not get worried about the operation, and leave the sweat that does not affect the husband's acuity.
And if your incision is like this, they can exfoliate that adhesion with ease when it is returned to its natural form and the entire adhesion is healed.
And if you put in the thigh salted water with which you wash, or distill it in the sun and dissolve it in water.
And if you separate the eyelid from the thigh with calm and place your hand on the thigh, and leave the last quarter of the album of the husband to be used for consolidative causes when it is healed.

And if you proceed to open the eye, insert the spoon into the subtle or small forceps, and press the flesh of the eyelid naturally so that by inserting the spoon, no continuous flow of watery substances occurs.
And if someone has a cyst that is extended or filled, it is said, and it is called the lemon of which this is the form of it:
And be careful not to touch the corneal membrane and ensure that the pupil is perforated.
And the insertion should be made in the hollow with a little salt twisted or cut from the nail, and it should be changed the other day; and the care of that is that it comes in so that it becomes healthy.
And if the cyst is not nervous and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it in that place, then this species of cyst is treated by doctors and is cured with the medicines recommended in the division.
And if you want to open that, you should open the thigh of the patient and take subtle lemon from the sharp edge according to this form: The first line of the text is "am subtilitat If sometimes that rarified and confined substance is released and entered into the body, then it distills from your urine into the wound, which can be either sour or salty, and is filled with pus on the following day.
And if you repeat the operation over that wound when it is completely healed, but if there is still some blood in it, then you should clean that wound and treat the abscess at the beginning of the next day when it is cured.
And repeat your operation over that wound when it is completely healed.
If the rarity of the tear duct is noticed in the wound due to great pain, it should be suspended on one side; and incise a part of that one, and do not leave the incision open so that no fluids of lachryms flow out.
And if it distills from the tear duct and is salty, it should be treated with salt when it is cured.
Chapter 17.
When the inflammation is caused by cold humors that have infiltrated the flesh of the body, it is called gout.
Some redness appears on the soles of the feet, and it is over-pampered when it covers the pupil, or it is applied or rubbed over the eyelids and soon the eyes become swollen and inflamed, and it is assembled near the baldness.
The operation on the foot is that the patient should lie down in the first position; and you work on the soles of those and collect all the flesh that can be easily separated with your fingers or with tweezers, and you cut the flesh at the beginning when everything is finished inside the incision, and keep the foot away from the patient's operation.
And is your incision at the place where you cut those or at the edge that has been recommended in the operation of the ungual, or at small forfexes that are collected according to the shape of the foot that this caput takes?
Then when your incision is completed and the whole flesh is moistened, you fill the hole with salt twisted, or drop some rose water on it and resemble the red powder of the album of the hoof, and place it over the cut corn entro that it is secured from the post-operation inflammation.
If the doctor suspects any cause of gout and is careful with cauterization, and fears the aftermath of cauterization, then leech the wound and treat it as such, applying the ointment to that operation as soon as it is cured, and it seems to have an effect on the flesh that occurred in this hollow.
However, I do not know if all cures of the hollow through natural or accidental means, iron can help, and do not place your hand in any of these operations until you see that this member is suffering from that operation.
Chapter 18.
Of the collection of sand in the hollow.
Sand that comes from those that are rough and cover the hollow, and prevent the operation of the wound, and lengthen the hollow over days.
Therefore, it is necessary to begin by considering whether the hollow in which there is sand is strong and not another disease that is sand, then collect that sand.
And is that you command the thigh to hold your hand in the upper part, and suspend those veins under one or two of your caution; and this one is a subtle duplication according to this form:
This line seems to be describing a process of gradually inserting two objects into a single space. A possible translation could be: "Two objects are inserted gradually into this form in the second
This line appears to be discussing the process of securing two objects to forceful but subtle veins, and then removing them once you see that the veins are becoming more relaxed and less knotted. A possible translation could be: "After securing those forceful but subtle veins with two objects, remove them once you notice that the veins are becoming more relaxed and less knotted.
This line seems to be advising the user not to cut the horn at its extremities and to be careful during the operation, ensuring that only the veins are cut. A possible translation could be: "Do not cut the horn at its extremities and be careful during the operation, ensuring that only the veins are cut.
This line appears to be advising the user to distill the horn once they have completed their operation, and to ensure that the acute corners do not become too sharp and cause pain. A possible translation could be: "Once you have completed your operation, distill the horn to ensure that the sharp corners do not become too sharp and cause pain.
This line seems to be advising the user to ensure that all necessary tools are available at the time of the operation and to apply pressure to the area to reduce pain, and to continue doing so for several days until the pain subsides and the area is sure to be healed. A possible translation could be: "If you do not have all the necessary tools at your disposal at that time, and apply pressure to the area to reduce pain, and continue doing so for several days until the pain subsides and the area is sure to be healed.
And then you repeat over the second hand that has been made healthy.
And this is the form of the forceps:

Of reducing hernias to the nose.
When you treat hernias with cauterization or with acute medicine following the narration of the case, and it is not cured, then you do not engage in it but rather touch the aposteme with maturity of the case, and take out all the moisture that is in it, and if it penetrates when it is discovered, the bone.
And then when the bone is discovered and sometimes in corruption or blackness, you then treat it with a tool of this kind:
It is made of sharp metal, and it is heated to redness, and the cap is made as if it were cut by a razor or an alizarin by fine points (as in the following form).
And place that over the corrupt location of the bone, and then rotate it between the fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that this cessation is rased.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity,
If the wound is well-consolidated and heals with good flesh and the body of the thigh is free from disease and remains so for forty days without renewal or postmortem and no accidents occur in it, you know that it is healed.
However, you should not be in the area unless you can reduce the fissure to the shape of a nose, and then follow this method: and it is that you will discover from second week am iron or am medicine sharp, and when you discover the iron, you take tribo next to this form:
The extrusion of the iron is triangular, and it should be the first one to be extracted from the extremity as often as possible.
And place the iron over the bone, and that is the one of the lacrimal; and along your finger a little of the horsehair, and pull back your finger as much as possible, and roll the tribo in as it penetrates all the bone, and that will feel the pain as if you were cut by a knife.
Then restore the location of the medical stimulants that dry out the skin, as you have just done.
When the flesh and the affected area are in pain, you return the matter that has seeped into the damaged parts to their original position, therefore, it is placed on the thigh.

When the heel is prominent in its entirety and does not cause pain during walking or decrease in size, you should relax the thigh, and place your hand over the area, and place the scarification cream on the heel that contains aloe, sarsaparilla, and other ingredients, and strengthen the cream on the heel with powders.
And the powder for the dust is what you take from the four corners of the leopard's hooves, and each corner is doubled into four parts; and make of those four parts.
And place those on one another according to the quantity that the heel needs. And strengthen those with hard dust and firm tightening; and repeat the cream on the heel's scarification; and remove the cream and smooth the heel every day and night.
When the ligament is softened, you should cover it with a layer of grease.
Then remove the ligament at the day and night according to what has been said.
If the hernia has already been reduced, then so be it, and if not, you should repeat the plastering on the powders and the stricture and the wounds as they become healthy.
Chapter 21.
Of the enshrine of the eminence of the uvea tunic.
When there is a disruption in the uvea tunic, and it becomes prominent and proceeds outside the eyes as if a grain of sand, and its form is distorted, and you want to enshrine it, then perform the operation on it as has been recommended, that you enter the agula into the socket of the uvea from the side where you have left it, and place another one on the part where the double agula is located, and make it penetrate and press the first agula according to its disposition; and then inscribe the location of the double agula and raise that part of the uvea in the circuit of the agula and tighten the mot.
When you have removed the gallbladder and placed it on the table, insert the needle into the injection of alcohol in the album and let it enter as soon as the thread comes out of the vine.
And apply this remedy to the wound that is comfortable for the thread to enter as soon as it is healed.
Some veins are found in the entire circumference of the drap that enters the wound, and it is perforated with a subtle puncture that comes to the preon of the wound, and the humidification of the abdomen descends and enters as much as possible.
And apply this remedy until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the cure of gout.
This illness known as gout is not the same as that which is adjusted in the gallbladder like water from a descent and is not that one.
The most important thing in treating this illness is that you apply the remedy to the wound with the dressing on the exposed part and dry it, and make sure it does not descend and remain dry, and this remedy will see its causes as they occur.
When it does not come down below, you know that it is wet.
If it is not prepared for the descent to the anus, as they have said, then you should place the intestine between your own thighs and gently press on a small part of it with your fingers, so that the continuity of the conjunctiva is maintained on the cornea of the eyeball (within the corner of the eye), and if it is not forgotten, the anus.
Therefore, if it is forgotten, you should dilute the water in the tail with which you have mixed salt or water in which you have already built a sugar solution.
And if it is cured of other causes, then enter that it is healthy.
Chapter 22.
Of the healing of the water that comes from the tail.
As they have already said the specifics of the water in the division and which one corresponds to the declaration of health, then you should do that second to maintain your health.
You should make sure that you place the intestine between your own thighs over a cushion and the wet tail, the stringent one.
And then pause for a moment near the eyelid of the eye that is opposite to yours, if the one that contains the water is the one that is opposite to yours; or if it is your left eye, then pause near the one that is on the right side.
And then hold your left hand near the one that is on the right side, if the one that contains the water is the one that is on the left side; or if it is your right eye, then hold your left hand near the one that is on the right side.
And then pause at the end of the finger that is opposite to yours, near the largest part of the ramus of the bone that forms part of the lacrimal ridge, and then hold your hand with your thumb and index finger, and turn your thumb towards you and towards the other hand.
And then insert your finger into the bone and feel that it has already penetrated due to the pressure.
And if the measurement of your finger is greater than the size of the space that is in the pupil and enters at the end of the iris, and it is the top of the bone; then you will see that the pupil is in front of the eye due to the clarity of the corneal membrane.
When entering the location where the poison is, and when you hit it with a needle once more, and if the poison descends so much, then you should put the intestine over the place where it will most likely see its vision, and enter the inside of the leg.
If it is only a small amount, then if the poison descends, you should remove that other vein as much as possible so that it will not be damaged.
If it is not descending, then you should easily remove it, and divide it into small pieces, and dissolve a little bit of clear salt from gemma in the poison and wash the hollow with it; and leave outside the hollow or stopper or infused oil on rose-colored albumin and ligua to wash the hollow with it.
We know those who were in our time who passed over that which was consumed by the albumin of the lamb.
And if you do not obey my order to enter the hollow of the eye because of its hardness — for this is the cause of many men who have hard eyes — then I advise you to take the sponge that is called alberid of the quality of which this is the form:
When you have pierced that joint, do not hurry to remove your hand from the wound, and do not leave it unattended until it is properly dressed.
Then enter again when they have finished.
You must prepare the compliment of your work, which is to be placed on the side of the patient's bed, with their head resting on a pillow in a dark place, and should be free from all movements.
Then pause in the nature of the gout so that it is lined with its natural skin, and do not allow any part to be cut off on either side.
And let the limb be in line with its position on the third day.
Then remove that from the dark place and expose the visible part, and look for any causes, and return the limb on the seventh day.
You should not make the gout in the time of the curers or too much in the infusion. If you have covered that the gout is made with water that falls on it very quickly and strongly in regard to looking at it.
If you accidentally receive an electrical shock, you should immediately cover the affected area with a cloth. Then, within the next seven days, correct the position of that part that has been affected by the shock.
If you cover the patient's face with a cloth, place your hand on their cheek for the purpose of regulating their breathing for a short period of time, there will be a darkness in the following days.
And if you gradually reduce the patient's pain and converse with them about their causes.
And you know that in alchemy, there is no excuse for the disciple of vision who has seen certain visions, and therefore you should be careful about the operation.
And it has come to our knowledge that some of those who have seen the Artach visions, and the Artach said that he makes fire in the Ayrac Magdaam by pouring it into the one who succeeds the water.
However, I do not believe that you have seen this in our land, nor has it been written in the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the species of Magdaan that are over those who know them, and those who do not know them.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Capitulum quadruplo quarto.
This sentence seems to be discussing the treatment of a condition related to the flesh or meat (carn) in the nose. Here
When in the nose there are various hardened flesh (carns) adjusted by some cause, which is assembled at Scorpio of motz feet or polyp eyes; and this disease is called polypus, as it resembles that eye represented. When the flesh of the malignant tumor is black in color; and when the flesh of the lion is not of a dark color.
In this case, where the leon (lion) is not fraudulent or cancerous in these cars (thighs), you should make the malaute (incision) between your own thighs and set it alight, and bleed the nars (veins) of the lion, and pick up the tip on those thighs. When removing the affected part, and if you comprehend that it is caused by a subtle gout substance within that part, then you should know that the entire flesh has been affected; if the cause of this is possible to remove, you should use one of the subtle instruments to facilitate entry into that part where the Roman rubs the cause. If your lord has an affliction or accident of gout, you should stop at that place; if it is one of the malignant gouts, you should cut and cauterize that within which is sanded and all the abscesses are opened.
And if your gout is in the nose, then it will be seen and wet or dry. If your nose is opened and the humidity process is inside the palate, you should know that it is healed.
If the humidity does not enter after that place, you should know that the flesh has nothing in the pus bones of the nose that has not been opened by the abscess.
Then, if you cover the opening with your hand, wet it with water, and pause between each dose to measure the quantity of the said or that cause, and enter the vagina and insert one end of the cord into the anus or another part of the body that causes this possible.
And suppose that this has been done, that the fragrant odor enters through the canals of the nose and is perceived on the golfball, which is seen by many children at school, and it is a cause that someone wants to do this.
And then pause the two extramits of the cord, one end that goes over the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and then apply tightness to the flesh of the lips with the flesh that is inside the cord, and you will know that the flesh has already been inside the lips.
And then extract the cord, and pause in the nose at the abstraction of the sac one calf, and you will know that after three days or more has passed until it is completely rotten that comes from the flesh.
When in doubt about the cause, stop at the nose with a hypodermic needle for a few days until it is cured.
If there is no remedy available, use that one.
This is the form of the instrument that the barber uses, which is composed of oils and medicines in the nose.
If it is made of silver or gold, which resembles a small lantern that has been slightly bent and the metal seems to be, then it is correct.
If you want, make the needle closed as a cane, and the needle of the barber's instrument is flat and exposed; in which case it is a handle at the bottom of it, where you hold it when you pour oil or water from the sebum and causes that are watery.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the text you provided is not a complete

Here's a possible translation of the sentence: "Watery discharges are seen in the external nostrils, and they are magnified and inflamed on some days, especially when the eye is exposed to the gaze of another.
When you have covered that with the beginning of the appearance of the patient, and have completed that. Then pause over the location or use cauterization or medicine that is in the place of the patient.
If the incision is made late after the patient has become large, you should consider if it is made hard, dark, of black color and with few feelings, then do not touch that with your iron, as it can cause cramps; four marks are given to that which is being incised in this way by the great malice over that which that had.
If the cramp is of lion's touch and not of black color, and sometimes it is possible to incise all of that, then you should remove the thigh and incise that part with fear, and cure the location as much as possible that is exposed and concentrate within when it is healthy.
Chapter 26.
Of the suture of the nose and lips and the forehead when the continuity is dissolved by pus or seemingly.
You know that when you find a solution of continuity in one of these cartilages, few confidence is given in that operation except for some men.
Thus, when it happens to any of those causes, which you consider if it is caused by cold humors in the body, and you adjust the lips of the wound with suture thread, and you carefully enter that part which is healthy.
If the lips of the wound are already separated and every part is healthy, you should cover every part of its apparent entrance when it bleeds. And you should adjust the lips of the wound with suture thread and tighten those, and over them sprinkle powdered dragon's blood and essential oils, and place a dressing made of consolidated plasters on top, and leave it for two or three days, and then replace that and turn the dressing and make sure that those holes are closed when they are separated, and carefully enter that part which is healthy.
The hand of the suture is that you add the solution of continuity or as needles have been recommended in the suture of the stomach, or add the solution of continuity to the flesh as you and know.

If that flesh returns, you should insert it secondarily and cauterize it, so that the cauterization does not return.
Chapter 29.
Of the reason for iron teeth.
When on the surface of the teeth of the parts of the jaw and between the gingiva and the gingiva are found rough, hard, and some are black and are citrine or verdigris due to corruption inside and are fissures in the teeth that are found.
And therefore you should open the thighs between your legs and place the head of the knife at the top, and cut off those teeth in which those rough and hard points appear and seem to be caused by some other cause, and that is black and citrine or other causes among which they are damaged.
Therefore, if that is all that is said in the reasoning, then so be it; otherwise, you should repeat the reasoning over those parts on another day and the third and fourth until you come to the statement you want.
You should know that teeth require various types of incisions and figures according to the preparation for your operation. For so that the razors can reach the tooth from the side of the gum, and these types of incisions are prepared according to the ones you will make, which will be the deepest:
Capitol xxx.
Treatment of teeth.
Make sure that you cure the tooth of its pain with all your skill and after the complete removal of it, where no cause is found that satisfies the flow of the vein when it is removed, where a substance comes out that enters when the removal is excused.
Make sure that when the gum is ready to remove the tooth, you are certain that the painful tooth has the vein passing through it and that it is in a healthy tooth, and you remove it and stop the pain within which the diseased and painful tooth is removed, as we have seen in surgery of the beards.
Therefore, when you need to certify which tooth is painful and know that you can scrape in the circuit of the tooth as it is saturated with the substance that is any virtue, if it is dissolved from the gum of the tooth of the whole part, and accordingly make that am those teeth, or am forfexs subtils al comensament petit a petit entro que aquela concucesquas.
And it is better to have large hands for good speech or cutting, and place the mouth of the tooth between the teeth that hold the one you have, and then draw the tooth secondly in the manner that does not touch that, nor the greater pain in the mouth.
And if you do not forget, then take one of those instruments, and place it at the end of that tooth with ease and effort to remove the one that is made at the beginning.
If the tooth is quiet or burned, you should know that you complex the tip of that and tighten that am the extremity of ray subtle per so that it is not squeezed in the time of your constraint over that am tenalas.
When you have very carefully performed scraping on the entire circumference of the gingiva and kept your strength so that it does not weaken or damage that part of the body, and then return to the thigh for the major pain of the patient.
And remember that you do not cut off what barbers do in their own practices and arrogance towards the eradication of them, as they do not follow what has been recommended; four ways come to visit large men who are difficult to treat, and whose health is improved in all, or some of those, or that one is removed from the jaw bone of the mandible as many ways have testified.
And the eradication of the tooth is washed with the mouth by the dentist or by the dentist.
And if there is any discharge from the gum, as many ways have testified, then remove some of it with your fingers and scrape over the wound, and if that does not cure it, cauterize.
The form of the forceps and their subtlety is such that the teeth at the beginning are of long external extramitation, of thin grip and thick, so that they are not bent when used to perform those tasks.
And they are as many as times of thick grip that enter when they are not bent, but are thin extramitrates.
And there are false teeth of Indian steel that are descentments of the right extramitrates, and in the extramitrates of those there are teeth of the kind of the beak of a goose called "cuckoo" by its name, which is strong, and they are of strong constraint.
Capitol.xxxi.
Of the eradication of teeth and of the stripping of the bones of the tridented mandibles.
When the eradication of the tooth that is tridented according to Roman law must be done for some cause, then you should place your hand over the location and press or hold the extramitrates of those that are assembled at the beak of a goose called "cuckoo" or "goose" by its name, the form of the forceps:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If you do not obey my instructions and use these forceps or pliers, it is likely that you will cut the skin and dissect the entire flesh and insert the instrument that is called this, which is a small lever of this kind:
It is of thin end thick and not bent so that it is not broken.
If by mistake the skin is cut, then so be it; and if not, help me with these other instruments of which this one has the following shape: the shape of the first instrument is a triangular extrusion in which there is any thick part.
The shape of the second instrument is that it is a triangle and has a thin pointed end.
And now help me with this instrument which has two ramps of which this is the shape of the following: And help me with other instruments which I will use in cutting teeth; the best is this one which is assembled like this large one and this is its shape:
The first line of the translation would be: "From the sharp or short end of the tortuous or short triangular extremity, which is any large one and not filled with anything that is not triangular." However, this translation might not make much sense in context, as the phrase "tortuous or short triangular extremity" is quite specific and may not have a direct equivalent in English. It could be better to
Here's a possible translation for the second line: "And another advice is that you use the teeth of the other instruments, as they seem to be similar to the others." This suggests that the text is providing advice on using different tools or instruments, and that the teeth of certain
Here's a possible translation for the third line: "But the skilled artificer is subtle in his craft, and he fails because he follows the instructions given to him for the operations and different diseases; four are of those diseases that the ancients did not describe or use any specific instrument for, due to the diversity of species." This suggests that the text is discussing the limitations of ancient medical knowledge and the need for adaptability in modern medicine. The phrase "four are of those diseases" could refer to a specific set of diseases or conditions that were not well understood by the ancients.
Here's a possible translation for the fourth line: "But if it is not triangular or filled with anything in the jawbone or other bones of the mouth, or if it is rough, then it is better to treat it as such in its place, as this is convenient according to the instruments and forceps that have been mentioned for the extraction of teeth, and this is the way: ...". This suggests that the text is providing advice on how to treat different types of dental issues, depending on their specific characteristics. The phrase "as this is convenient according to the instruments and forceps" suggests that the advice is based on the tools and techniques used in ancient dentistry.
If there is any small swelling little by little, and it is bound or held in the mouth so that it does not escape or leak through the whole bone is empty; and then restore the place with appropriate medications for this.
If in the bone there is a small crack, you must report that of that crack and its color, and treat that inside so that it becomes healthy again.

Chapter. De the cure of the prominent teeth over the others.
When the prominent teeth do not follow the natural course of the body in that form, and especially when it is in women, and especially in the elderly, therefore you should consider: if the tooth is nothing else but another tooth, and it is not possible to suture or apply a linament to it, then you cut that one; rather than it being annexed to another tooth, you insert that one into this instrument of which this is the form; and it seems like it is from a pig, and it is made of Indian iron of extramitation with sharp edge.
If your tooth is aching and you feel pain for several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and it is not caused by another tooth, then it is called a toothache.
If the tooth is exposed to mercury, then you should apply mercury of Indian silver in this form:
If it is all made of mercury and the mouthpiece is smooth; and if it has points like needles, which are inserted into the tooth as many as possible in a short time to make it easy not to cause another tooth to become painful and rot. And then line up the tooth in the mouthpiece, and adjust it according to the razor blades.
If the tooth is cut and the tongue touches it, then you should cover that with your finger that the edge of that fragment is not sharp and not broken, and it is covered so that the tongue does not touch it and the word does not rot.
Chapter 3.
For the restoration of tooth decay, use silver or gold.
When the teeth are affected by concussion and displacement, caused by percussion or hammering, and the jaw cannot bear it, and you have treated that with medical tinctures, but it has not been effective, then do as follows: use your hand to press on the area, and do not let the jaw move to those that are stronger than gold and not silver, for silver turns green and soon sticks to itself on those days, while gold does not change at any time.
And the shape of the recce is that you grasp the gold and hold twice as much between the healthy teeth, and as you grow, the twists of the gold between the crooked teeth, or if one or more, enter when the tissue reaches the healthy tooth of the other side. And repeat the pressure within the part of which you began, and tighten your hand as much as possible and know that it is not harmful.
And your firm hold on the gold forces the teeth that did not escape to relax.
When you descend the excess parts of the bladder with forceps or tweezers, and add those to each location as needed, and convert them along with the hidden ones between the healthy tooth and the crooked tooth, so as not to cause harm to the tongue. And you should follow that advice like a Roman.
If it slips or breaks, hold on to that or those with another hand in the same way for the entire time.
This is the form of the teeth and the figure of the section of healthy teeth and crooked teeth, as follows:
And when you return a tooth or tooth to its socket in the corresponding places, and they regrow as advised, and remain strong.
And this is only done by skilled artisans and surgeons.
And some bones are suitable for the cause of cow bones, and they are made in the form of teeth, and placed in a location where the tooth lacks, and are strengthened as advised, and remain and serve for a long time.

This language seems to be a form of medieval French or Old Provençal. Here's a possible translation:
The operation in this case is to open the mouth of the patient, and if there is anything inside, remove it; then lift the tongue, and insert it into that nerve following its direction within the mouth after the language has been released from its recent use.
If there is any pain or difficulty in that area, and this is for the consolidation of plague, then you should cut and separate that part within which the limb has been split and the nodosity has been dissolved.
And remember that it is not a true fissure in the flesh of the limb, and that you separate here the artery and the coming flow of blood.
And wash the clothing of the incision with water, or with wine or vinegar; and place your hand further down the tongue; it is then that you hold the thigh with your other hand to prevent another injury.
If you have a flow of blood, place your hand over the wound site; if the blood is coming out, then cauterize the area with a pointed cautery that fits well to this purpose. And this treatment is for the other causes within which it may be cured.
Chapter XXXV.
The extraction of pus from the tongue.
Some wounds occur in the tongue, causing it to twist resembling a small piece of cloth that prevents the tongue from performing its natural function; and if it is magnified, it is more beautiful within which it has swollen the mouth.
When the operation is made in the male, it opens the mouth of the urethra and considers the apex.
If you see the urethra of dark color or black, hard, and the patient does not feel any pain, do not touch that part.
If it is inclined to whiteness, where there is humidity, you place the scalpel on it, and insert a small spatula under it, and insert the rest of the portion; and if you find it in your hand during the operation, you stop immediately with the forceps, as it is restricted by the suture.
And return to your work when you have treated it with care, as it is washed with clean water and salt; and care for that as in another cure when it is healthy.
Capitulum xxxvi.
Chapter 36 on the extraction of the apex of the male urethra and of that which is nothing in the groin and of the other apices.
When you have discharged in the groin well, those are glands which are assembled like cloth, which become deformed and are not female apices, which when you treat them as it is said in division and they do not become healthy, you consider if the apex is hard, of dark color, of little sensation, you do not touch that with iron.
If the request is for redness and the area is large, do not touch that part with iron; instead, leave it there, and let it be, or tear it off if necessary.
If the request is for whiteness and transparency, and the skin of the part is delicate, then handle that part as if it were fragile.
The operation in that part is what you consider, taking into account the completion of the scar or if it has decreased due to any decrease; and then the thigh is sewed down, and the end of the thread should be in the upper part, and the server should bite on the language of the patient, and the servant takes between their hands the noble instrument of which this is the form:
If it is made of silver or gold, and it is delicate like silk.
Then how you present the thread to the patient and show them the scar, and then cover that with your thumb and hold it in place, and pull that through the parts as much as possible. Otherwise, if you draw any cause from the membranes, and apply that instrument of which this is the form:
Otherwise, if you draw any cause from the membranes, and apply that instrument of which this is the form: It is assembled like forceps, but the extramits of it are turned around, so that the opening of any one of those is at the end of the other, which is made of sharp iron.
If this instrument is not at your disposal, insert that sharp piece of the one that is the form of this, and make sure that one part is sharp and not the other.
And perhaps you have inserted honey, insert the other after this hand-like instrument of insertion, and apply the insertion to the foot so that the foot is moistened with warm water.
If perhaps there comes out pus, moisten it with warm water made from the decoction of milk or honey and similar to that of the causes for stitching, if the flow of pus is restricted, and treat it inside so that it becomes healthy.
And some vessels may be found in the groove of other stitches or another of those that are made of golden hair, and insert those after you have said in the insertion of honey-engulfing stitches.
When I had already treated a woman with apoplexy, which was born in the abdomen of her, this apoplexy tended towards a dark color, with few symptoms, which had already closed the abdomen of her, and the woman breathed directly, and had been prohibited from eating and drinking water, and had been pervaded by death for many days or two.
When the aposteme had already suffered so much that there were half a dozen rails within which it was forced to pass through two tracts.
Then, please handle it gently and remain in one of the holes, and pull out that one, and tear off a piece of it, and take hold of that part of the large piece, and carefully insert it into the other wound, and carefully put your tongue in the mouth, and take a sip of its saliva, and keep the hole in that aposteme.
And then, remove a large portion of it, and do not run from it unless it is a little bit of sin. Therefore, the guillotine of that woman is absolute, and began to drink a lot of water, and carefully watch her, so you did not stop inserting into that aposteme holes for a long time, and this aposteme became located in place of that one, which was inserted inside when it was prolonged.
Therefore, you should burn the guillotine of that woman, and then add this; and carefully walk around and do not say what God did to that woman's prophecy.

When gout is cured and they have said in the division, and it does not comfort your cure, and you see that the swelling of the foot has already gone down from the ankle and is subtle, then you should cover that with a cloth that you have rolled up into a cone; and if it reaches that far, and is bloody, of a dark or black color, and does not reach the center, then you should cover the incision of the foot, for there is fear of the thigh.
When you see that the second manicure that I have told you about is white and long, which you make on the thigh and press the tongue of the patient with the instrument by which its form is given and it fits at the nail, and take that down and insert it into one of two instruments that are called in the incision of two needles.
And cover that with a cloth that is not inserted until after it has been adjusted over the natural term, for if you insert it too much, you will lose the sound of the voice.
And when you insert it, use that which has been recommended in the incision of two needles and cure it within that is healthy.
If the thigh were terrifying due to the pain of the patient, it is necessary to use an iron in the cauterization of the wound, and the hand of the cauterist should not be but sharp water, and that you hold the head of the thigh in your hand, and press the tongue of the instrument with which they have said, and press the water that has been said at the top of cauterization, and comfort that living cause, and do not make it too wide or subtle, and from that fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the form:
When the patient's cavity is located where it was previously placed, and the medical instrument is placed on the vagina, and the mouth is opened over the vulva for the saliva or mucus to flow out due to the intrinsic medicine, so that the same cause does not affect the groin of the patient and cause pain.
And take hold of the medicine with your hand, and apply it to the uvula for the time that you see there is no pain or swelling due to the biting of the medicine.
And if you wish, take the forceps and wrap it around the end of the finger, and immerse the forceps in the medicine, and insert the finger into the cannula through which the forceps adheres to the cannula, and do as many times as you can until you get what you want from the cauterization of the gum, and let it dry and crack after three days or four.
And if you instruct that the medicine is to be repeated, repeat it, and let the cauterization abstain in the circuit of the gum with the forceps immersed in the border, and modify it according to that water that is in the circuit of the medicine, and make it clean with fresh water, and cure it from the swelling, and finish it with what is necessary for the healing.
This remedy for healing is placed because it has been incised and lengthened for fear.
This appears to be a medieval medical treatise written in a language similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. Here's my attempt at translating the given source sentence:
If there is obstruction in the throat, enter the extremity through the mouth of the patient and let steam reach the uvula on the side where it is blocked. If the uvula is not blocked, then do not enter.
And if you iterate over those dry spots, do not make this curacy at the end of the event of apostemata, as too many will adjust in the apostema, and do not assume that you are making it, but rather make the declaration of apostema of the cautery.
If you do not have this instrument present, then take a cane and make a closure of the hou in the extramition of the patient, so that the mouth of the patient is covered, as the hou's closure prohibits steam from burning the mouth.
And this curacy is good for health.
Capital.xxxviii.
Of extracting spines and of the water that adheres in the groin and of other causes.
Obstructions are found in the groin or on the sacral vertebrae or on any other cause.
When you see that the pain is not what it appears to be, over which you can see the eye, then please place your tongue on the instrument entering solely through the mouth, so that you can declare to the patient that this is in the gullet.
And if it does not appear that it is hidden in the gullet, then please make the patient vomit through the mouth, so that the food that is digested in the stomach is expelled from the gullet; or that the stomach vomits a little water, or some of the intestine, or a piece of sponge from the sea leopard, and it is held firmly there, and the vomit is passed through that, so that the stomach can be emptied. And may you catch an eel and hold it firmly by the tail, and it will be drawn out easily; or hold a turtle in your hands and pull it out slowly and carefully.
And if you do not know the causes that have been said, then please use an instrument of measurement in this form:
When there is a large amount of thick liquid that resembles a small piece, and during the extraction it is possible to make the cavity easier by entering it into the patient's belly.
And if the patient's head is raised on their shoulders, and you guard that part of the head that touches the neck, so that it does not hurt the bones or the spine, or that the midwife has her hand there.
However, that part of the thigh that is entered is usually wet, due to its knowledge of the location of the cause attached and relieved below, and pulls the hand away from it using the instrument, as long as the quantity prepared is taken into account when it is forgotten.
Chapter 39.
Of extracting the gallstone attached to the gallbladder.
When the gallstone is treated as advised in the division of the cure by physicians and does not relieve, consider that part of the gallbladder in the patient's belly, because you have not yet compressed the tongue of the instrument that you have recommended.
If you see the sign of inflammation, extract that little or that subtle gesture gently.
And if it is not possible for you to remove that, then take a concave needle and enter it into the affected area of the thigh, and place a hot iron at the concavity of the needle, and make as many punctures (as long as the inflammation is not mortal and is in the thigh) and abstain from giving too much water.
And if you take a full mouthful of water and work the mouth of the patient in that way, and rinse the mouth with that water; and do not transfer any cause to that and give water to the patient an hour later, so that the inflammation decreases as much as it does when water is drunk.
If you do not forget that they have recommended, take a substance such as cinnamon or saffron to smoke the thigh or the uvula with the instrument that has been recommended for smoking in the sufumigation of the uvula.
Do this, it is done in four days.
This appears to be a description of a medical procedure involving the use of smoke (sufumiguacio) for sterilization (subfumigacio). The procedure is performed on a patient with a wound or injury, and the smoke is applied to the affected area using a tool called an instrument. The smoke is then directed towards the patient's mouth, which is placed over the end of a canula, to ensure that the smoke does not escape until the procedure is complete. The purpose of this procedure is to sterilize the wound or injury and prevent infection.
If the patient does not cooperate, you must repeat the sterilization process using different methods until the patient complies. It is also important to ensure that the patient does not consume any food or liquids, and only drinks clear fluids such as water or broth. This regimen should be followed strictly to ensure the success of the procedure.
This is the tool used to treat the wound or injury. It resembles forceps, but has a curvature in certain areas. The specific shape and size of the tool will depend on the location and severity of the wound or injury. And what is the table for the gout patient, and its end resembles the beak of a heron, which is sharp, in which it is sanded down with lime, so that when any cause is found, it does not hurt.
The text you provided is not in Latin, but rather in the
In which the sum of the sermon is in apophthegms and in sections of theirs.
The following text is a medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish and French as well. Try to guess what the text means and translate it line by line into English like this:
And so various in perforation and section of them by different hands, of which one is for the specificity of stitches in them; and therefore because of the moisture.
And the second hand is proper to the places where the accidents of the body occur, that the stitch in the head is another than the stitch in the buttock; and the stitch in the fleshy part is another than the joint; and for each of them there is an operation.
And perhaps some stitches are those that do not pass through but are at a mature stage of the sinus in them or as an addition to them.
And other stitches are those that are not passed through when they are crossed, and are not mature by their complement, as the stitches that are proper for joints, where one stitch is for each joint, the one being prolonged within what can be reached in the circuit of it, and more so if the limbaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, causing contraction of that member; or it is a proper stitch of the principal member, and if you delay the perforation of it within its matured end in the principal member; or it is a proper one for the buttock, so that you do not perforate the cru, not due to incompletion of digestion, but because it is proper for the buttock, so that the onset of the wound does not elongate the parts of the dint, and it becomes a fistula or is at the end of the term of the member that is not cured. When you know the time for the incision of the appendix, and it is ready at that time.
When you know that the maturation of the diarrhea and the cessation of the fever, and the decrease in the delirium and the pulse, and the sharpness of the abscess, and the other symptoms.
And when you know that the incision should be made in the area where the abscess was previously removed and from which the purulent matter comes, and from the curing of the eminence.
And the incision should be made on the length of the flesh or of the chest, if the abscesses are in the parts of the thighs or feet, and in places where the tendons are, the cords of the nerves, the arteries; and, at last, in all places that do not reflect, use perforation according to that member.
When the abscess is in the flesh, it is better to make the incision when the digestion of the second part has been confirmed, as they have said; and if you make the incision at that point, the length of the urethra is prolonged, and the mouth of the abscess is deepened, and the lips of the endurated labia are stretched.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When you administer a small puncture, and in the large areas of the apostemas with a large puncture and wide or cuts according to the variety of the size of the apostemas.
And other parts of the apostemas where the codena is cavity and fixed, when it is made with pan and fixed in the term that already exists, as that which happens in many doublets and buboes.
And of those that are not yet cut, have three angles; and of those that are cut, in the quality that is cut, it happens like the figure of a thorn of a rose, as the apostemas of the anguillifors.
And of those that are in the quality that is cut, round and lunar section is given, and it seems like those.
Less of that in which there is not like those that are surfaces of the apostemas leons, that you make a puncture in that with a surface puncture or so flat, only.
When the apostemas is large and has already bound a sane motiva, you perforate that and do not touch what extracts all of the poyre in that hour; there is extracted from that one part, and placed the apostema within another day, and there is extracted a larger part, and there are made motas watched according to the graduation within what is forgotten.
If the wound is from a sharp object, or a tight grip, or a small child, or an elderly person, and the animal spirit has resolved itself at the exit of the sickness, and you operate on it, then you can return it to its original state.
Take this warning with great caution, and pay attention to the hole you make in the post, as it may cleanse the wounds and consider if the wound of the post is small or flat, and then you should manage the wounds of limb or antler; and if the post is large, and the fissures of the hole are sharp, then you should be careful that you pause mechanically in each joint as they appear.
And if in the post a part of the tendon is separated from the muscle or has been concaved in the circuit, then you should know that you complete it with antler or with a piece of cloth as when you have cut or burned, how much humidity; and stretch that within the third day; and proceed to treat this and cure the one who cares for the wounds that are inside and become healthy.
If you happen to lose blood during the time of your operation, you should immediately administer cold water and apply it to the areas that are swollen, and place a cloth over the location of the visible wounds.
If the flow of blood persists, you should ensure that you are providing regular and proper care and medication to the areas that I have recommended in various locations of this free and independent nation.
If it is during winter and the site of the blister is in the area with the most nerves, you should ensure that you wrap the powder in violet and oil-based cream, and place them over the affected areas.
If it is during summer and the affected areas are rough, you should ensure that you apply moistened powder or oil-based cream to the skin, and keep it wet until the last day, as advised, and ensure that you remove the blister and cleanse the area, providing care for the wound as needed to make it healthy.
And it is also necessary to know the treatment of blisters universally, more so than the specific method for each type of blister, as I have already mentioned in the previous paragraph about the cure of all blisters.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the text you provided is not in a
The sentence "De seccio de apostemas les quals veno en la codena del cap." translates to: "Of the sections of bets that come in the crown of the head
The sentence "En la codena del cap petits apostemas, e so de specias de nodes les quals conteno tunicas que so a lor factz; e las specias de lor so motas." translates to: "In the crown of the head, there are small bets, and those are of special nodes that contain tunicae for them; and their special motions.
When they have sexual intercourse, and those that seem to contain liquid resembling honey. And of those that contain liquid resembling polls, and similar to them; and of those that are hard, rigid.
And in the section of all, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, as you have to extract from them without causing harm to the archer.
The operation in the section of those is what you expect from them with the instrument of that form which you know contains, and enter if you are wise.
If it is that this contains liquid, then divide that by section according to the length of this section, following this form.
And begin in the section of line .B. to enter at line .G. Therefore, when the liquid is evacuated, you remove that part that contains that liquid, and do not fear any cause for all, for many return if they are Roman of that cause.
And if it is present, submerge the cot in Egyptian water, and if not, in water and salt; and fill that with plague and let it enter another day, for this will corrode all that is Roman of that film.
When you have already made incisions on the Egyptian-like coat according to your needs and instructions, if you trust that there is no cause for that film; then cure the plague on the Egyptian-like coat when it is healed.
If you see large knots, then you should insert the following form into that: Make a cut without form, and place knots between the two lips of the cut and the end of that part, and exert your skill in extracting that tunic.
If you find that the arch is against you, then you should know that you have been first encountered.
And if it seems that the plague is divided into cuts and cures according to what you have said; and if the cut in the plague is pushed back, then it is less of a wound and less moisture.
And some people have symptoms of these plagues that are in the head of men who do not have any moisture; the cause is what you have inserted over an arch in the head of a young woman and hardened the arch as if it were a deaf, sharp, white, which could not be pierced, and if that happens to a person, the plague will affect that.
When injuries occur in the head of another cap, this is not the same capitol, as the injuries that come to the heads of children and you must know the reasons for these holes, but all of this is a superficial section.
And pause the perforation of those who have a lower part because it is possible that the cause of the disease is in the parts with a lower part.
And apply those remedies that are appropriate for the cure.
Capitol Chapter 42.
Of the section of scrophulas which occur in the neck.
Wearing these bandages on the neck and shoulders, and some are injured in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, and those bands that are produced between them, and all scrofula of these is found in its own skin, and so as in the nodes and bandages of the head, so as they have advised.
And the specifics of these scrophulas are warts, four of which are some hard, and of those that contain humidity, and of those that are malignant which do not respond to treatment.
When you see good disposition in the Tocament, of which the color of water that is manifest is properly to the color of the skin, and is not attached to any part of it, nor to the nerves of the collar, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not preonded, covering that which is dry superficially of the part from the part of the other side of the line of .G. within the line of .B., and burn it throughout the entire part, and extend the two lips of the skin from one, or from both if you need them, as has been said in the apostles of the head, and extract it little by little.
And there is more caution that the vein or nerve is not inscribed.
And if the sweat is not hot, that does not adjust to your skin or disturb the thighs, and that you have inscribed water that is not necessary to be inscribed; then if you inscribe the vein or artery and forbid you from your operation, you should stop on the glass vitriol trissat or other powders that remain fluxes of sand, and stretch the plague, and lay it within that which repairs the sharpness of the apostle and makes the plague mollified and begins to be porridged. When the wound is separated.
Then return to your operation once you have completed the abdominal cavity.
And if you find any other small pustules, insert them and clean them.
And if it is near the great vein of the pustule, cover those who have not inserted that pustle into its root. Cover that with something that is quite folded and that lets in air when it falls to the ground.
And fill the bath with water that you have already submerged in Egypt, and take care of that.
And if you insert the entire pustule, cover that with something that you adjust the lips of the bath and cut as much pus as possible without causing any unnecessary inflammation.
If you think that there is unnecessary inflammation due to the size of the pustule, cover the root with something that understands how to insert the lips, and remove it and stitch it and do what is said.
If that pustule contains moisture, make a superficial hole in it at the location where you see it to your maturation location, and stop making holes until the pus from the head of the bust comes out, as they have said.
And if you need to make an incision, use a sharp knife and follow the same path as the previous one, because this is where the pain of the corpse comes from. And when you see that the wound has already been cleaned, then cure that sharp knife made of flesh inside which is healed.
Chapter 33.
Of the section of the syringe of the plaster, an accident happened to the goule.
Cut off the old section of this syringe in the plaster, and have not seen any man in our land who did that.
And this is the inscription of their speech.
Few men have this disability, covered with the fact that the extraction of the plaster is avoided, as by this no good can be done for all the veins and major arteries of the thighs here.
Fewer are those who have plasters in their mouths or goules or two holes, when the thigh is not in the canal, covered with the section of the plaster to avoid losing the loss that is made by perfection.
Thus, when you wish to do it, make three or four small cuts around the circumference of the circumcision, or four in the middle of each distance between two circles for quantity, where the cut should be in the perineum, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for a cut, where there are no fatty tissues and the screws of the scar are loose.
If the doctor is afraid, cover the hands that extend the gallbladder as much as possible, and cut the gallbladder inside when it comes to the channel, as this will avoid the screws of the scar if there are any causes for them.
And then make the incision according to what has been recommended; and it means over the cut of the channel for the flap that is of that eyelet which is of you and for the abscess of the wound.
And keep the wound clean for some time.
Thus, when the hour is set in which the perforation is done, add a few drops of the gallbladder juice, and that will be enough for the cartilage.
And properly administer medicines that make the flesh more comfortable when it is healthy.
Here comes the translation of the first source sentence:
1. Then I command the wound to be cleaned thoroughly when it is completely consumed by the malady; and the malady of the patient lasts for three days; therefore, I order the wound to be cleaned in this manner, and cure it within that time if possible.
1. And as you have seen in my practice, it is because a section of the lung's bronchus is blocked and inflamed, and you were called for treatment, and the wound was cleaned as the mucus is from the lungs, and the plague was discovered and the wound was cleaned of the plague that had been in it.
1. Therefore, you confessed that it had not been infected with veins or inflamed, and the wind was of the plague, and cured it within that time if possible.
1. And do not despair of the section if it does not cause pain in the vote, and return to your duties within the next few days.
1. And now I tell you that there is no fear in the section of the epigastrium.
The text you provided is not in the language of Latin, Italian,
When there is a cut on the testicle that occurs, and it is called a hernia of the testicle.
This hernia of the groin is called hernia after the color of the body, and it is common in women.
When there are two hands, whether it is natural or accidental.
And in the natural case, there is no remedy.
And the accidental is followed by two hands, one resembling grass-like nodes, and the other resembling apothectem, which is made by node of an artery, and there is fear in that. And it does not seem that this assumption is true in the same way as iron in that which is small. And I advise you to investigate that and if it resembles grass-like nodes, and is not suspended in any vein, then you should insert that as you would the nodes, and extract that from where the pelvis and bursa are; and otherwise, you should examine all of it, and cure the place from which it is believed to be curing.
Chapter 45.
Of section of the species of nodes.
The nodes have special motions and I have already mentioned all the species of them in the division.
When you advise so that the difference between node and exit is known.
You say that exitus is heat and fever, and violent pains come when the heat of the superfluity is suppressed; and putrefaction stops the fever, the pain, and the heat.
Nodes are not heat or fever, and this cipher is the one in the bag that is of the u sac proper.
And then comes the color of the body, and its beginning is like a cube and it is made to be as a vase, either larger or smaller, and there are two species, four or five, which are grasses and contain humor, and the colors of the humor are motes, according to what you say in the division.
Therefore, when you reach the treatment of nodes, what you expound is that and inquire about it at the beginning, what is called intromerent, according to which its form comes to the head that is this one.
And it is the inquisition of the apothecary and all nodes, and that you take this intromerent and enter it into the moist place where it atrobes in the apothem, and you roll your fingers on it as much as you know that this intromerent has already penetrated the coda.
When the last one is done and the size of the hematoma is measured, take out the screws and consider what is inside the wound.
If the moisture is forgotten, of whatever color, you should insert it as a superficial cut as I have said in the other hematomas.
If there is no moisture on the wound of the screw, you should know that it is heavy.
Scrape over it with a cut not in the shape of a cross according to this form: As he taught you, suspend the screw, and remove the entire wound as easily as possible, and if you can, keep the belly or bag over it and take out that suture from the node.
If something breaks during the operation, it is not possible to extract that healthy one, and you should see this as soon as possible, and you should remove it as soon as possible from where it does not cause any disease.
If something causes a disease, little or much, the node returns according to the most.
If you ever notice that the Roman has any small part of his body affected by sharp corrosive powders, then add some water to the plague and strengthen it, and place it on the spot where the plague cautery was made, and treat that with another caustic treatment.
If it is large, then you cut the lips of the Roman and treat him with what is appropriate for that.
If it is pulsating, then you cut and heal the place where the glass was cut that was broken and straightened, and let it stay for two days or three until the plague stops and the boiling of the sand ceases; and then return to untwist what is Roman.
Capitol. xlvi.

Of those are the forms of the intraments, and there are three kinds, which of them is the greatest, and of the others it is smaller.
The form of the intrament greatest is this one:

It is therefore suitable for those wounds, incisions, fistulas, and abscesses that enter those of the bones and from other causes.
And these points are large, like great needles, and are made with the greatest care, and are made of lead, or of copper, or of silver, and the best are when they are made of lead.
And these points are the experiences of black plum, which are made to fit when they are opened, the fistulas in the cavity of those which are reflected by their reflections, which are reflected at their levity at those reflections.

The fourth line of the text seems to be describing the different types of cuts or wounds, with some being sharp and causing more pain, while others are not as sharp and are not as painful. The author suggests that these wounds are made for the purpose of excoriating nodes, or hardened areas of skin, to prevent the formation of varicose veins or nerve damage. The author also mentions that this procedure helps to heal the area and relieve any discomfort caused by the excoriation process.
This is one of the forms of magical amulets, and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, as you see in the pictures.
Their effects are similar to those of the rays of the sun, and they produce an alkaline effect.
And it is in the external application of the pointed alcohol that the hidden effect is found, and in that course over the parts of the fingers and nails, when you want, as you see.
The forms of spirits, which are placed between the dots that you see, and do not penetrate the flesh, and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of venous amulets, which are used to stop the flow of blood, and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small. The forms of the blood:
Their effects are similar to those of lemons, round in shape at certain lengths, and they are subtle.
When these winds are present, it is necessary for you to use many, fewer, and some, in order that the blood may flow quickly when the abscesses need to be opened, and you should not rely on medicine at your first attempt.
Do not use these winds to open abscesses throughout the body, and do not use them except in locations with fat, such as the legs of the changes and the hips, and the mammillae and stomach and the nipples and the ears, and similar to those of the carnous lacerations.
And some instruments are painful, looking similar to small knives after this form; by which the blood is opened when it is cut during a flebotomy, or you must incise the vein or the artery.
And some instruments are round in this form.
Chapter 47.
Of the treatment of the nipples of men who are assembled from women.
Some instruments are inflated for the nipples of certain men, you must follow the rule of sleeping as it begins to be hairy, and if they are inflated, and the nipples are assembled from women, and Roman apostates, leave them.
When the one who has gout arrives, cover that with those lunar sections according to this form, from the line of .B. to the line of .G., and remove the entire gristle, and add the plague of the carbonized medicine, and adjust the lips of the plague as it is cut, and cure that which is sick within.
If the breast declines towards the parts on either side and is softened by its great magnitude, as in women, then it should be divided into two parts, each of which should be placed above the other, with the larger one inside the smaller according to this form of the line of .B. and the line of .G. And remove the navel that is between the two lips of the plague, and remove the dimple, and attend to what has been said about the suture and the powders that are necessary in the cure within which it becomes healthy.
And if you do not complete the incision of this that covers the incision due to the restlessness of the thigh and the flow of blood, then you should cover that the plague of the cot is submerged in the cold corrosive and lay it that which is corroded that comes from the gray, and attend to that which is within it that becomes healthy.

When a hole is made in the postern (a type of door) that leaves the titillus (a term for a small, thin piece of wood or metal used to hold something together), it is necessary
to cut the posterns that leave the titillus from the species of scrophulas, which are hard and contain a cell that is squeezed out.
When some contain moisture; and those that contain moisture are likely to be unscarred after the lunar section of this figure: from line .G. to line .B. And as all is evacuated, you should complete the cut and leave the entrance open until the next day.
And when the cut is finished and is properly treated, enter if it is healthy.
And if the cut of the nodes' specimens and of the scrophulas is necessary, then you should make incisions over that area as has been said in the section on the scrophulas engulfment.
If the plague is extended to the part that is infected, then you should administer this cauterization after what has been said in the section on the plague.
Chapter 49.
Of cuts that occur due to archery or the veins.
When the bowstring breaks and the arrowhead is consolidated over it, wounds often occur at the site. And those who know that inflammation and wound are for the artery or vein: four, when the wound is for the archery, it is added to the pre-chest; and when the pain is felt in the wound by the thighs, you will hear in it that it is stridor.
When that which is by vein is red in the manifestation of the body, it is called erysipelas.
If the section on this appendage is incorrect, and especially in those that are left with the ankles, and the girdles, and the collar, and the most parts of the body; and it is large, then it is better that the cure be avoided, and that which is in the extramittents, or at the head, is also best avoided.
Moreover, about that which is by them for inflammation of the orifice of the urethra, if the section is made in the abdomen, it is divided in the codon; and it is better to make the section uncut and to cut the urethra, and to open the tunics that are discovered.
And put over that hole and make it penetrate into the other thigh, and stretch the urethra at two places, which causes you to have fissures in the extraction of multiple urethras that are in the temples.
And puncture the place that is between two ligaments and let it enter where it can reach all that is in it, and dissolve the appendage.
When administering care in the quality that is necessary for those who have pain within their limbs; and this care is convenient to be done when it is necessary to heal.
If an abscess is caused by vein cutting, you should know that you have to hold it with your hand at the place where the abscess is, and insert the needle into the spot where you have held it, and let it penetrate; and it should be in the double fil that you extract the abscess from the other limb, and tie the abscess with the limb that you have told you in the limb of grape4 of two parts from the extremities of the fil.
If you fear that you will extract the fil, then enter the needle into the hole where the abscess is, and remove all of the abscess from the first point of the needle, and tighten the ties in four places.
Clean the abscess in the appropriate place when it is necessary to remove that which is inside, and if you see that there is excess fluid in the fil, then let that be removed from it.
And then pause over the sponge that you have immersed in vinegar and oil, and then administer the cure that is made of calm and what is found within it to become healthy again.
Capitol L of apoplexy which occurs by twisting of nerves.
How does apoplexy occur in the artery and vein, and it seems to occur apoplexy in the nerves when it occurs by their compression or by labor excessive, and apparently.
And it is made the most of in the places of the helpers or the tailor, or in all the place where the joint pains are most.
And apoplexy is severe, and it resembles the color of another heart, and in the greater dispositions of their positions and when they are straight with vehemence, it seems to be amazed in the chest.
And it is not apoplexy added in the first part of the heart, and then the girdle is placed, and it is much used to all parts and does not go to the parts behind or behind.
Therefore, those who are in the joints do not cover that they are wrapped in iron, for very much the force will overcome the contraction.
When a person has pain in the head or forehead, it is called a headache. If the aposteme is small, then apply leathers to those parts and cut off the excess.
And if it is large, then remove that with a string, and cleanse it, and take it out; and adjust the thread to the suture, and care for that as it heals.
Chapter 1.
Of the section of aposteme that occurs on the lip which occurs in the belly.
And for those who have warts on the belly and in other parts of the body, and those which are similar to those in the belly, and those which are small and those which are great; and for those whose lips are conversant, and those which are little and those which are magnificent.
And if you have seen one and in the belly of that there were two which were less like warts and there was no difference between those white, of little substance.
When the lips of those were turned inwards and were being made, and moisture ran throughout that entire time.
Then you closed them and made them firm in the other foot.
In the operation of their insertion, it is considered labor if the thigh is moist, and the color of the flesh is white, moist, of a subtle nature; you close them with spatula, and they are in your presence, with cauteries in the fire, four watches required for the excision of the sanc, and if you find the sanc, cauterize that.
And if you see the thigh is swollen and trembling, keep away from the operation with iron; rather, labor to prepare recent points, and strengthen that hand, the one that has been spoken of; and rest it for two days.
And adjust in the stricture of the plum thread; therefore, do not stop strengthening the plum largely in the thigh, as long as it is separated and falls by its own weight.
When a person has a large belly, if it is touched in the area, it causes fear and pain, and more so in the stomach.
It is possible that you cut off the gout of your patient, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
When that part is healed, apply this remedy.
When you look at the object that is of dark color, with few sensations, with regular shape, and that is not made of iron, you should not presume to insert it into the body.
When you come for rememberance of cranky bone.

Of the eminent cure of the navel.
The eminence of the navel is caused by various motives; either by fissures of the umbilicus which lies over the abdomen and yields the intestine or hernia through which others rupture; or by congestion of veins or arteries as it is said, or by narrowing of the vein.
If it is by a fissure of the umbilicus and by the yielding of the intestine, the color of the gangrene resembles that of the chest; and it is called leon's pain, and appears in various situations. And if it is by the exit of the hernia, you should know its situation as that which has been found, with less diversity in vehemence, and when you prescribe that to the tympanites you hide it, and then returns; and more is needed for it, and you must enter the abdomen and work vehemently.
When it is caused by cold humors, it is called gout. It does not hide itself when the first pain is felt, nor is it tightened, nor is it contracted.
If it is due to sin, these symptoms appear as black deformities.
When it is caused by flesh, the gout is heavy, thick, and hard, and remains fixed after a certain amount.
When it is due to venery, the gout touches the flesh of the leon.
The operation in it is that you consider it sinful if the umbilic eminence is due to sin of arc or vein, or from venery; you know that it is prohibited for the cure of the leon, as there is fear and no one knows how to treat it in the capital where I have mentioned the gout due to arc and vein.
And if the eminence of the umbilic is due to the intestine or the belly, you know that you must command the patient to hold it tight and extend it; and approach the circuit of the entire umbilic, and command the one who was on the opposite side between your thighs over the testicle, and encircle it with spatula in the circuit of the umbilic over the place you have seen with the testicle; and extend the width of the gout to the parts of it as much as possible; and join or separate and close the manicure of the leon's belly.
And so you extend the ligament over the tendon and insert the needle into that point to push the intestine; and if you have not tightened or held it with the ligament, then you pull it out and pull the intestine to the parts of the belly.
And if you have tightened the cloth, then hold that arm up; and insert the excess of it.
If it is contrary to your arch or vein, then surround that point, and return to your operation; and take two needles and insert them into those two holes and enter the needles into the circuit that you have made around the tendon in the hand of the crotch, which threads pass; and tighten the tendon on four points over the needles.
And if you want, remove the needles and leave the place where it is soft and falls down by itself; or insert it when it is subtle and becomes soft, and care for that arm as much as possible that covers the incisions within which it is healthy.
And if the eminence of the navel is of flesh or humor, then cover that you conquave the tendon as we have said and disturb the sanctity or humidity that atrobes in it, and care for that arm as much as possible that covers and consolidates the place.

Of the treatment of a sprain.
The first source sentence can be translated as:
When the ancients made incisions on certain parts of the body where possible eradication of the disease could be achieved, they would cut as close to the breastbone or thigh as possible, and more so when beginning small.
When the ancients were more skilled and knowledgeable, it does not mean that you are able to cure this disease or have seen another, nor that this has been passed down to us.
The operation on this is when it is allocated as has been said, because you descend and the patient's legs are purged of black vomit some viscera, and it is noticed that this is the case if it becomes gangrenous with manifest anger.
And prepare the patient by the preparation in which it is located for the operation, and prohibit certain things that could harm this; and carefully examine all parts of the body to perform a thorough examination within which no cause of the disease's effects is found. And run the sand, and do not leave that place empty, and extract the parts, and remove the sand as much as possible from both your hands or from the instrument you can most easily from the instruments.
If you have any opposition to the enlargement of a vein or an artery, then cauterize it at the point where the blood flow ceases, and proceed with that in another cure where it is healed.

If you ever see the beautiful thigh of an exuberant woman, and it is not another part of her body but only her buttocks, and neither young nor old, then the man who performs the operation on her lifts her thigh with your hands, and ministers to her stomach with the back of his hand, pressing the water to the end of the penis, and presses spines in this form:
It should be two sharp points, of sharp extinction like spines; but rather, it may be slightly short in small parts, so that in the operation it does not pass into the bowel, and that you can see that.
And consider if the generation of hydrocystic is from the bowels, and that you hold that I cut through the umbilicus for the quantity of three fingers' width on either side, on the right over the penis.
If the generation of hydrocystic is from the exuberant thigh, your cut should be on the left side of the umbilicus for three fingers' width.
If the generation of the child is through the table, then your incision should be on the left side.
And it is not necessary for your incision to be on the side that you want to cut the thigh for, as this would cause excessive bleeding in that area.
And perforate the instrument throughout the codon, and insert it into that incision, and lift your hand from the codon and the siphac, and remove that; and if the quantity of a ungla or envir.
And perforate the siphac when the spumon reaches the location you want, and that is the place for the urine. And extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the form: And it is similar to a silver canula; it is made of silver, or iron, or gold, at the point where there is a small hole, and on the sides there are three holes: two of one part and one of another part; and it is the end of the incision according to the pen of the feather, as many times as possible.
When the knife is withdrawn from the abdomen, it should be placed on the patient's belly, then gently press down on the knife, so that the water escapes in that direction, which if you pull out without covering the abdomen, then the body will resolve the spirit animal's problem, or may end up with five punctures near death.
Then remove the water in the second amount of virtue from the patient, and according to what you understand about the dispositions of the body's virtue and the beauty of the leg and the goodness of the leg, then.
And when you withdraw the instrument, and release the water that causes it, then hold on to the water that is held by the belt that holds the codpiece of that member which you are recommended to press with your hand.
And repeat the instrument on another day as many times as the body tolerates it, and remove a small amount of water each time, and keep doing this for several days, and be careful not to let the water come out except for a little.
If you fear the anus, and there is a great amount of water in it, then you should bury that part in sand, moisten it with oil, and let it be exposed to the sun for a long time; and cure that part with desiccating medicines when it is dry.

Regarding the cure of children who were born without a hole in their urinary tract.
Some children are vomiting from their stomach, and the head of their mixture is not perforated (or is straight or not in its place).
Therefore, a pointed cauterization can be made to perforate the throat as much as possible, according to this form:
And pause in the throat with a subtle pointed nail and tie it, and either for three days or for twelve hours.
And when the urine is hard and cloudy, and then return it.
If you do not hold onto the plummet, it is possible that the urine that will be over this spot may not follow this rule.
Is that which is struck with the plummet, if it is treated with the clavi of Plomo, as they have said, for several days until it is amplified.
Are those in which the plummet is not in its place, it is led out, the cause of which is that one must raise the head of the vagina so that it cannot urinate in the parts below; and this generation is not due to the fact that the sperm does not reach the higher part of the uterus, and it is a bad sign.
And the maneuver of the operation on it is that the thigh be covered over the right side, and extend the head of the vagina to your left hand with a strong extraction, and insert the cap of the vagina of the location of the periurethra am sand, as if it were written with a pen, or that you do not know any part, so that the appearance of the cap of the vagina is similar to the head of the vagina and the plummet falls in its place subsequently that it covers.
You should pay attention to the first four movements that may occur in your surgical operation for the flow of sweat; and stop at this point where you cut the sweat, and care for the wound inside if it is cured.
This appears to be a Roman numeral, which corresponds to the number 6
In the prepuce of the penis, near the root of the glans and corpora cavernosa, and adhesion of the prepuce of the glans, there may occur.
Visible movements may occur in this prepuce of the penis, and it is characterized by fat tissue.
And of those one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
Not malignant, but rather suspends under the skin and cuts that part inside which is entirely covered; and then places the hand over the edge of the wound in Egyptian fashion; and that one, cares for the wound daily until it is healed.
And if the prepuce is malignant, of dark color, then you should cover that part with cauterization and the root of the penis.
If the prepuce of the penis is not circumcised and one part of the prepuce is cut off and the other part is left intact, then you should cover that part with skin that was cut at the beginning, and when you cure the other part, make sure it is not torn.
And if there are already galls and black spots on the genitals and prepuce, then cover everything that has already been damaged or is about to be corrupted or corrupted, and put a dough made of flour, milk, and eggs on it, which has been crushed with a mortar and pestle.
And when you cure that part, do so within the other cure when it is healthy.
If the flow of blood is stopped, then administer cauterization in this form:
Cauterization is applied in two ways to the body, once for stopping the flow of blood and the other for the plague when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is rotten and destroyed completely at that time, then cover that you introduce into the meat of the prepuce a catheter made of plastic for that urine passes through it for that.
In the attachment of the foreskin to the tip of the penis (and this attachment only occurs in the one where the foreskin is, and not over it; and when it occurs attachment by sore or by abscess) you should exert pressure on the swollen part with your thumb, as soon as the cord has been dissolved and the tip of the penis has been separated from all parts.
If it is difficult to determine those exquisitely, you should know that you are pressing on some cause of the tip of the penis and the foreskin, and thus, if the foreskin is thin, it will be perforated by its thinness.
And separate the foreskin from the tip of the penis by a thin part, which is already wet in the water so that it does not adhere to another surface.
And your care should be to stretch it after it has been consolidated.
Chapter 7.
Of the education of children and the care of what occurs in those who are circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution for continuous infections as with other plagues: but rather, when it is our operation and our will, and it is intended for children, it is necessary to assign it to the better operation and let the fewer ones be lost for health.
Thus, it is stated that the ancients did not perform circumcision on all parts of the body that were free, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because they have acquired by experience that the major part of artificers and barbers use circumcision and washing for cleaning and hygiene is no longer needed; and they use false lips and sewn lips.
And you have already prohibited all these methods and did not improve washing for artificers, false lips, and sewn lips that in washing are as uncomfortable as the ungla, where the codena pus is hidden, where the codena of the prepuce has two layers, and Roman the tonica pus further, and very much it is difficult for another inscizio and pain. And the washing which is done by alphecati, and is digital, of which they use the shears, is not safe for the inscizio of the end of the male member, where very much it is difficult to enter in the wound of the member.
In the operation of the ungla, very much you should use iron and corrupt your operation. When the child's codpiece is short by nature, and there are no visible signs of it that require circumcision, and you have seen this.
But the forfex is not too sharp or thin, as I have seen described by others, rather it is proportional to the size of the acumen that follows, and thus the acumen that you press with your proportioned two acumens, and inscribes a comparison in a time; and the compression of the foreskin contains the codpiece of the scrotum of the entire part, which does not make any mistake of all.
The method of the first operation is that you make the child stay more comfortable if it is of those that I understand to be small, which you only do by stretching the foreskin over the codpiece as much as possible, and making it enter another day.
And make that pleasure spread throughout the entirety of that method that you are capable of receiving your intelligence. And make that stay between your most prepared statues, and not be a cause of discomfort; and hide the forfexes in your hand or on the child's thigh, which the child will not see those or other of the instruments.
And place your hand on the patient's thigh and breathe into their mouth, and remove that which is causing the tightening of the neck of the verge, and modify that which is added to it in the case of deafness.
The form of the modifications in the hand, this is the form:
Some are extra-thight and others are tight, so as not to be too tight of the lock, and as the length of the acute angles is like the length of two manubs engagement.
When there is an error in the world's formation, it is often that you escape the inner code entirely, or part of it, because of the inscription.
Therefore, you should extend that part of your body to the side where it hurts and lie down on your back with that second equality.
If you cannot hold it with your own hand, then take it out of the wound and place it on another part of your body.
If it has been three days and the swelling has subsided on one side of the abdomen, then you should enter as soon as possible to remove the abscess cautery, exfoliate that part, and lay down on your other side prepared for it.
And keep the head of the swelling away from it, so it will not be affected by this.
And cure that part which is inflamed with the powders that were recommended in the treatment of the powders.
If it is placed on the abdomen according to measure and follows the divisions, then you will not notice it.
And cure that part which they have said should be treated when it is healthy.
Chapter 88.
Of the cure of urine retained in the bladder.
When there is retention of urine in the bladder, it is caused by swelling or hardening due to pebbles or sand, or by inflammation or scarring, and it resembles the symptoms described for the hands in the division.
If the urine is not dissolved and you have severe pain in the abdomen, then cover the abdomen with cloths. Then administer an extracomfort to the urethra using a syringe, of which this is the form: It is of silver and subtle lion, with a subtle canal of the penis, similar to a palm and finger, in which there is a subtle canal at the top of the head.
And the way to expel urine from that patient is to take the doubled finger and lie it on the hair or beard for good grooming; and insert the extractions of the finger in the rear part of the thigh, and if there are any causes of the hair in the forfexes, then introduce it in the canula with vehemence and apply it to the border and album of the hou.
When the patient lies on their stomach, and the physician gently touches their genitals and private parts, using olive oil and water.
Then the physician enters the anus with ease, if it is easy to do so; and bends the anus towards the belly; and presses the cirena into that; and presses that into the anus as it comes to the vagina, and the vagina should be entered in this order, not in another, for it may cause harm.
And gradually extend the penis through the small hole, until the urine comes out through the small hole.
Extract that and use it for urinary catheterization, and do not stop until you have done so and use the cirena after the bladder has been emptied and the uterus has been relieved of pressure.
Chapter 17.
The quality of the catheterization of the bladder is clamped and the instruments that are suitable for this are closed.
When an ulcer or abscess occurs in the vesica, or is suppurating in it, or there is a gaping wound, and you wish to distill water and medicines into that, then use the instrument called a clamp as follows:
However, if the opening of the ulcer is narrow, it should be closed. And in that case there are three ways: two from one side, as many times as necessary.
In the beginning it is located in the following manner: where there is flesh, and as much as it can be pulled out, and then when any cause causes that tissue to be drawn away from the wound, it is also drawn away, and when it is expelled, it is as if a clamp has been used on it, which presses naphtha into the battlefields of the sea.
Therefore, when you wish to prevent moisture from entering the vesica, insert the end of the clamp into the moisture, and draw out that water which is expelled from the parts on either side, four times the amount of water is drawn out in the cavity of the clamp.
When the protrusion of the clap is entered into the groin as recommended in the circumference; and when that humidity is pressed, four times as much pressure is applied to the vagina, and the thighs are placed at right angles.
The form of the cervix that is being stretched, and that form is:
If it is made of silver or gold, of which the tip appears to be like a small quill, and the handle is made of ivory.
Then hold the vagina tightly, and pause in that humidity you want to stretch in the vagina, and place it between two fingers of the double hand, and heat that humidity over the fire.
Then enter the end of the stretched vagina into the groin.
Then stretch your hand over the vagina with the humidity that has been stretched inside the thigh that already has the humidity that has been permeated in the vagina.
If you do not have a vagina, then take a silk ball and press on that circle; and pierce through the entire circumference; and enter the fingers as far as they can go in those tracks, so that it is stretched; and add the circle so that it is added alsofatur, and you will pause in that amount of humidity that you want to have, and oil and water.
And you should fasten that with the instrument and make it as tight as you made it in the vagina, and express the fluid from your own body within, but if moisture penetrates into the vagina.
Capitol LX.
Of the extraction of stones.
We have already mentioned in the division the specifics of urinary stones and their treatment with medicinal drugs, and the difference between those that are generated in the urethra and those that are generated in the vagina, and the symptoms of those.
And it has been said which stone I removed from you with operation and section.
And the stone generated in the vagina is that which remains in the vagina.
And you should relate this to the manifest exposure and abbreviation.
Therefore, say that the stones generated in the vagina mainly affect the child; and from those symptoms it is understood that the urine that is excreted from the urethra is similar to water in its subtlety, and appears in that sand; and the thighs are affected by their genitals, and the buttocks are swollen, and they are dressed; and at that time the anus is exposed to those.
It is the duty of the physician to care for the children who have reached fourteen years of age, and it is difficult to treat elderly people. When young people are affected by this disease, it is more common in women.
And of that which causes the urinary bladder to be larger and the cure to be longer; And if it is fewer, it is opposite to that.
And when you reach the cure of that, first examine the thighs of the patient, and remove any obstructions that may be in the intestines; then the fenestra can be closed with a needle, and the urethra must be inspected for any obstructions.
And if it is near the thighs of the patient and is compact and moist, then the urethra must be inspected for any obstructions, whether the urine descends to the top of the vesica or leaps from one place to another.
And make that point as close to the patient's thighs as possible, and leave the rest of the thighs open, so that the entire urethra is exposed to the parts outside.
And make sure that it and the entire urethra are exposed.
If you feel the urine in the space, then you should cut as much as possible around it.
If no part of the thigh is touched, then you should cover that with oil if the left side of the body is affected, or with that specific cream if it is a child, or with the appropriate medicine if it is an adult, and insert it into the anus. And when the bladder is placed in front of the thigh. And convert it little by little into the back of the vagina.
Then place something over that, and expel it into the desired parts of the vagina, where you made the incision.
And command the midwife to press on the vagina with her hand; and command another midwife to extend the fingers of her right hand to the desired parts of the vagina, and hold the clamp that is left in the location where the incision was made.
And insert a sponge that has been soaked in the appropriate liquid, which is this: Then cut it in the space between the anus and the labia, not in the middle, rather near the left thigh; and let the incision be on the bladder and the thigh be in the anus, and make it a transverse incision so that the incision is wide and does not tear the vagina according to the amount of the bladder that can be cut from the possible, and not more, for if the bladder in the anus is cut, the vagina will forget its defect.
You know that from the stone, there is one that has an angle and borders, for which the increase of its size is difficult by this means.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And after reducing the abdomen or hernia to its
And if it is that which has sharp angles and margins, adjust it in the fissure.
If there is no mistake made, you should cover that part with something, or grasp it gently in a proper manner, the end of which is where you grasp the foot, and do not let go; or you can insert the subtle instrument of curved end further.
If you cannot do so on that part, then increase the thickness of the thread slightly, and if you see blood flowing out, tighten it further with that which has been melted in vitriol.
If the foot is less than a, then at the beginning you push it into the mouth of the vesica and place it over there; and then push a small one in; and if it seems to have fewer strokes than before.
If the foot is very large, then ignorance is that you insert that part very deeply, and one of two things may happen: either it remains or becomes inflamed due to the continuous distillation of urine, so that the place is not completely solidified.
If the expulsion is not complete, then do not forget to cover that part with something, or grasp it gently in a proper manner, the end of which is where you grasp the foot, and do not let go; or you can insert the subtle instrument of curved end further.
When you have completed your operation, fill the wound with gauze and apply a poultice of aloe and dragon's blood, and tighten that. Then place oil on that dressing and either red or rose oil, and apply it to the wound so that the poultice may be absorbed.
Then raise the patient's leg over the edge of the bed, and do not let it slide down the third day.
When that has slid down, clean the area with water and oil, and apply it daily until it is completely healed.
If in the wound you see discharge and corrosion, and it appears as if the drug has melted into the vesicle, and for that reason the prohibited ointment (and this is known by the excretion of the drug from the urine) should be removed from that wound and the drug extracted, then if it causes the vesicle to corrode and putrefy.
Then wash the wound with water and vinegar and salt, and apply it in opposite direction to all parts, and that which is most suitable for the cure when it is completely healed.
When you have covered all the hours of the cure, and you lie down with your thighs spread apart and adjust the medicines that were placed on the spot.
If the stone is small and is in the meat of the bladder, and it gets stuck there, and the amount of urine is prohibited, then you should cure this as I recommend so that you can reach sectioning; and too many cases have been reported for this cure and are accused of sectioning; and you have already done this, and it is this form of the perforator:
of triangular extrusion, sharp, stuck in wood.
And take care to hold it firmly, and then remove the stone from the bladder so that it does not return to the urethra.
And enter the iron into the bladder, easily perforating if that perforator comes to that stone. And roll the perforator in your hand and in that small stone little by little, and you perforate the perforation of it as you push it from another part to penetrate; and the urine is completely eliminated.
When you press your hand on that part of the skin which is behind the groin, where it is swollen, and it is forgotten by the urine, and the thigh becomes healthy.
If this cure is not suitable for you due to any cause that prohibits it, then place a cushion under the skin, and another under the skin. And close over the skin in that groin between two openings. And extract that. And remove the liment and modify the scarred sinus, which is made in the wound.
And it is not necessary to remove the liment from the skin, but because it does not return to the vesicle, and the other liment is also not used, when the fiel is slipped from the edge of the skin, the codena returns to its place and draws the wound.
And for this you need when you have the fiel slipped, that you raise the codena to the parts behind it, or that you return the best part, and draw the wound with what has been said.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the text you provided seems to be a
Here's the translation of the line you provided: "Extraction of gravel from the thighs.
When pain is experienced in the female genital area, it is called "peyra" and is of little birth.
If you see any urine in any of those, the cure of the patient is difficult and it is forbidden by strong hands.
When the female has a strong desire.
And the second is that you do not find a female who is wise enough to tell the doctor when she is given to a man, or is of the women who have not been trained.
The third is that you do not know this art, especially the operation of the male organ.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision on the female's clitoris is longer than the location of the clitoris, so it requires a larger excision, and in that case there is fear.
If you need to do this, then know that you take a wise woman, and it is not difficult.
If you are not private about this, then know that you take a subtle woman or a mature woman, or a woman who is in this art and has left the art.
Therefore make this presentation and command the one who does everything that you order him, from the investigation of the clitoris to the beginning; which causes it to look if the female has a desire, know that you put the thing you want in the ass of the man and want the clitoris.
If that gout becomes severe, cauterize that part with the pointed cautery and command the doctor to place it on that spot.
If it is not visible, command the midwife to insert the instrument into the patient's cavity and examine the uterus, keeping her left hand on the bladder, and compress that part well.
If that gout becomes severe, I advise you to gradually remove the instrument from the bladder's opening, dividing it into parts as you proceed until you reach the end of the vagina.
And place the pointed cautery on the specified point of the patient's vagina, dividing it into parts as you proceed until you reach the end of the uterus and center the bladder in that part, and the doctor will say that it is not causing any pain.
And the incision should be small at the beginning; and then insert the probe into that incision, and if you feel the uterus, command to adjust the incision according to the amount you know that the uterus is getting swollen from that.
You are aware that the species of pebbles are movements: four of those are few and large, and rough and harsh, and long and round, and have sharp points.
Therefore you know how many species there are of pebbles that you signify about the same thing that you want to speak about.

And cure the plague.
When the acuity of the pain becomes appropriate to the joints, and the place is soaked, then return to your operation when the stone is outside the body.

Chapter on incision for hernia.
Hernia is not but an addition of moisture in the white gut, which is left with the cord of the genitals containing the seed, and it is called a hernia.
And if some worms are in the proper fascia of which the nature is prepared in the part where there is another egg; and the cord of the genitals is between the white gut which I have spoken of, and it is not until then that it is known as a hernia.
And the generation of this hernia is by debauchery which happens to the genitals, because it is spread among them, and some worms happen by hitting over the genitals.
And this moisture has different colors, either the color of it is yellow or it becomes pale red, or brown, or black putrefaction, or white slimy, and it is known that it increases.
When the joints are cleaned by these means, this addition of water is done on this: four if it is in the white cube that has been said, then the abscess is cleaned and a small piece of cloth is left hanging down from the tip of the toe, and the genitals are exposed, so that moisture covers the entire part.
If the moisture is in its proper place, then the abscess is cleaned and a small piece of cloth is left hanging down from the tip of the toe, and another person estimates that there is another abscess.
If the moisture is between the genitals and the white cube, then you should leave the sentiment.
To determine the color of the moisture, spread the color of the moisture on the abscess in the cotton that is placed inside the hollow; and then, according to what is seen in the fold of the cotton, judge from there what it should be.
Therefore, when you come to the care of the iron, you should cover the command at the thigh that it is a fleebottom if it is possible, and sometimes the cost of the ple.
When the patient is lying on their back with their legs apart for a short time, and then pauses the motion of the legs.
Then place your hand on the left side of the patient, and command the servant to stand on the right side of the patient, who extends their arm from the hip to the two lats of the chest and the navel of the abdomen.
And then take some salt and divide the chest muscles of the lower abdomen by the length within a certain number of inches.
If the cut is made according to the correct line of the abdominal muscles, and it reaches the white bone called the coxal bone.
Then remove it and observe, and keep this in mind so that you do not reinsert it; and your excavation is the one that you excavate from the part that is suspended by the hand and carefully scrutinize the excavation according to the amount you can possibly do.
Then perforate the coxal bone with a wide hole and extract all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision from the uncinate bone, and extend the scissors to the parts below; and do not touch the coda with the genitals comprehending, and insert the scissors into the manicure that is possible for you. And insert it into the whole or into the testicles, and most of the subtle one, if you do not carefully examine the incision of it, it is not guaranteed that the water will not return.
If the woman undergoes the operation of her coda at the time of your operation, when you have closed the incision of the scissors, return to that, and adjust the two lips of the coda of the genitals with the sutura, and treat that wound as the others, if it is healthy.
And if the woman is corrupted by another malady, know that you lie the veins which are so much in the suspensory, and remove the woman, and treat that as they have said.
If the water is added in doas parts equal, know that the doas are the ernias; therefore, insert it in the part that you have made in the other engualment; and if you see that it is an operation, then you make it.
And then you should try to remove the sac, and enter into the submerged wool with oil or rose oil; and place another wool on top of that which you have submerged in oil and rose oil, and expand it over two guttae and the miracle of the stomach; and fold over the pleats and powders, and lay them on those that follow this form:
When the patient's thighs are open and cushioned with cloth, and their hands are held together; and their feet are made tight at the ends with a knife or damp cloth, and the strain is applied to the sheath of the tendons, and one end is inserted into the other, and the other end is held at the pantile, and two extra strains are applied over two thighs and two ankle straps, and all the strain is adjusted in the sheath of the tendons.
In some cases, this hernia is medically treated with cauterization instead of sectioning with a knife; and it is that you grasp the cauterizing needle subtly and insert it into the ring of the guttaverses, and ignite afterwards if they have advised to enter within where the white cyst containing water is found, and then you hold the cauterizing needle in this way: And it is assembled like Greek letters.
And then the hernia is pierced in that cyst, and it is ignited when all the moisture is expelled.
And if you want to enlarge the incision, and scrape it, and scrape the cauterization subtly ignited; and insert the second one that is possible for you to enter when you have eliminated all of it; and keep away from the fire that does not touch it.
You know that this operation is safer and longer lasting than sectioning.
But if you have an objection to using a cautery at the time of sectioning or cauterization, or during the operation, remember that this objection is for your own good, and I will treat the one that is said.
But if the patient is afraid, and does not hope for the second operation because of its horror, then you should administer perforation according to what I recommend; and when you are certain that you must, for what has been said about the meanings, that this hernia is dangerous.
Remember that you must cut the patient on any raised place, and then perforate the cautery in the low part of the belly, and stop the perforation when you reach the length of the coat.
If the wound is wide open, it will completely drain the poison.
Then place your hand over the incision site and press it down firmly, to prevent more poison from entering. And cure that inside as soon as the plague is healed.
However, if contrariety is to the good of the poison at that time, and you perforate it: and this is not done but for this reason that the white pancreas in the orifice of the plague makes contrariety and prohibits the accumulation of poison, then you must either put in the plague penny or instrument of which the gold is extracted from the gallbladders, the form of which is preceded; or adjust in the oppression of the plague a small one.
And you know that the poison returns, and it is aguegua for about six months or longer; and when it is added, you must perforate it secondly after that manual maneuver, so that the thigh passes through those days.
Chapter 63.
When it comes to cutting on a hernia of the flesh and its treatment.
You should know that in the section about this hernia, there is fear of harm to the larger parts; because I have seen the release of this one and it was saved for the better.
When you remember the operation in that and the specifics of the posts.
Then, say that the posts are born in those whose genitals are conjointed and is called gout by hot causes: either by sudden coldness which is dissolved in the genitals, or by puncture.
And it is the color of the post that corresponds to the color of the body, and it does not become pale in that pain, and it is a heavy post.
And very much the post is papillated, of which the color is dark, and it does not have a smell at that.
And some points are made by nodalization of the arteries, and by inflammation of those veins which are already known by the memory of the patient, or by inflammation of the veins.
But it is known that this is due to inflammation of the arteries because the post spreads when you press on that with your hands; and it does not touch that.
But what is made by inflammation of the veins is not dispersed by any cause that you compress with your hands.
When it is possible that this special section is a cut and on the other parts; and that you insert the code of the genitals, and stretch the erection to the parts thereof, and extract that from the white cipher, and untie the suspensory of the vessels, and tie them, and insert the suspensory that you untied from the entire part of the parts of the erection.
If the erection has already been well consolidated in those fleshy parts, you should know that you extract the erection and insert it there.
And if adhesion occurs between any cause of the white cipher or between that which is between the thighs, you should know that you untie all that adhesion and insert it there by means of a round insertion.
If the part where the adhesion occurs is of flesh, you should know that you insert all that thereof and extract the erection as has been said.
When your operation is completed, you should fill the hole with white thread on red oil and see; and take care of that as for another cure which is made when it is healthy.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the text you provided is not in Lat
From the cure of a hernia that is from the gut.
When an inflammation is wrapped around by some wrapping that seems like a softening of the testicles, and it is difficult to move and walk on the thighs.
In the treatment of this condition, there is fear of that which precedes the rememoration.
However, we will speak of operation in the second part, which was done in the first part.
And say that the thighs are to be placed on an elevated bed; and raise the suspensory of the testicles to the parts further away; and tie the codpiece of the genitals to the threads that you see on the girdle, and hold onto those other servants that you have, and extend them as far as possible.
And then insert an iron needle through the hard part in transverse section on the right side of the thighs when they are discovered.
And then remove all parts that you have said in the extraction of an artery, which are in the templates.
And then insert an arrowhead in which there is a double gutter, and tie it to the first of the places where the inflammation occurs, and tie it to the other one that is seen at the end of them. When you have inserted the knife into the long side of the thigh, and extracted that which is added with the humors that are fetid and corrupted.
Then, carefully remove the disease from the other diseases in which you want to be born because of those that do not have two generations, which is not bad for this.
If you happen to hit all the balls, it is clear that the testicles are extruded or that the testicles for this reason are in harmony with the vessels, so that they are privileged of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they are established, or that they are due to such a reason that they are not young in those.
Chapter 65.
Of the cure of inguinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is by incision that ends in the scrotum extended over the abdomen from the anus of the mirror of the belly, so that the intestines of that rupture are at the end of the intestines.
This rupture is either of the cecum or of the gallbladder, and happens due to certain causes: either by blows, or by pricking, or by noise, or by lifting any heavy object, or by seemings.
The symptom of this is, when it extends to the cecum, that it happens little by little over a long time and not suddenly, and it causes abdominal pain to enter through the intestine as the cecum constricts the intestine.
The symptom of this is when it extends to the cecum, that at first it causes severe pain suddenly; and it appears different from the usual appearance further down the spine, and this is due to engorgement of the intestine, and the cause of this is the cecum's interference with the joints of the cecum.
Sometimes the intestine is forgotten by the bowel wall, and this is called an intestinal hernia.
Some are made by vomiting, and some are found in the bowel fold, and here they are held, and there is great pain in the abdomen, and some cause more severe pain and greater discomfort when moved.
In the treatment of the spices of this disease, iron is feared, because it is believed that it must be avoided in that place.
The first source sentence to translate:
When it comes to the ribbon that covers the male organ, and inserts it into the body, and closes it completely along its length; and then fixes one lip of the incision on the other side as indicated by the doctor to close the incision for those.
If the incision is made according to the quantity that you are able to remember that of that it will be lost.
And remove those patches that are left on the covering of the male organ, entering if the white circular patch of any part is discovered.
Then enter the said point in this way that it comes to the testicle, in this way that it is between the white circle, which is left on the covering of the organ, and then between the other white circle, and release the adhesion that is in the part behind the organ.
And if you can, cover the male organ with the ribbon on the edges, and extend the white circle to its left, and raise the organ with the ribbon to the incision; and command the minister to extend it and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind in the completed solution.
When asked if there is any cause for the intestine being wrapped around the white bone, they say no. If you suspect that it has any cause, then you should examine it on the inside of the belly.
And if you proceed to the point on the side of the abdomen of the testicles by cutting through the which runs around and is full of sin and sickness as they have advised in this that they have said.
And apply wool dipped in oil and rest on the plague; and apply the ligament that they have recommended (and some of the white bladder is cauterized, which they said about the incision of the gallbladder, where five motas veguadas happen to those) and tighten the ligament so that it does not fall.
If the pain of the gallbladder is delayed, apply cold water to the tail and rest on it as they have said.
And cure the plague with another cure of the plagues within which is healthy.
Chapter 66.
Of a ventouse hernia.
In this hernia it has not been seen that it was being operated on during the treatment of the patient with iron.
And the first thing that was done was to do what they have recommended in the hernia that you have; the which is to cut through the which is easy to do for the patient; and to dry in the middle of the area in environment the apostema that I have ordered this, within which if the vayssels come out.
When the plague has been treated according to what has been said, and it is known that it is healed.
Capitol, LXVII.
Of the deformity that occurs in the ankles.
Some have observed ruptures in the ankles as has been said, and have removed the location.
And they do not cause any harm to the intestines in the body; and if they do, it is very little; and then return to normal in all hours.
If the time is prolonged, a fissure is made in the gallbladder as it places the intestine in the gallbladder; and this causes the gallbladder to extend in the ankle as has been said, which causes the gallbladder to stretch, and then it becomes soft and the location from which it was extracted disappears.
And the treatment of the gallbladder is by cauterization as has been said, preceded by the narrative of the gallbladder.
And some have been cured of the gallbladder by ferrum according to this method: and it is that the ankle covers the inside of the thigh with your own hands, and removes the location of the emerging intestines by cutting them in half according to the degree of three fingers.
And then tightly hold the white key that is inside the lock that has been discovered.
And then hold the thumb and place it over the prominent part of the key, and press that on the stomach.
And then hold down the other prominent parts of the thumb with the fingers, and adjust one of them to the other.
And then extract the end of the thumb, and do not inscribe the key of the cipher completely, nor extend the hole, nor another cause as you will know in the treatment of hernial enterocele.
And then treat that as in the treatment of diseases, and when you inscribe the fields, cleanse that and restore the disease inside that which is consolidated; for the key contracts and does not adjust the prominence of rupture.
And cauterization is better in this place, where it is properly used for health.
Capitol, Chapter 88.
Of the softening of the lock of the testicles.
Observing the lock of the testicles in healthy men is softened by hormones that make the tissues around it soft, and adjusts the gaze.
When it is necessary to examine the patient who is lying on their side for the treatment of the knee, and to cover the entire leg that has been softened over the natural knee; and then to adjust the pillow as needed at the sutures.
And if you want, in the beginning, the excess of the softened leg is divided into three or four parts and is fixed with sutures.
And insert between the sutures; and then cure for the cure of other diseases that come when it is healthy and cause the wounds.
Capital. LXVIX.
Of castration.
You know that castration is prohibited in our law, and this is because of the reason that I remember it in this free book; and it is not necessary to remember it except for the hands, of which one is in the knowledge of the doctor when he is buried in that, which knows the cure of the animal that happens to it; and the other hand is that we have need of castration of other animals for our pleasures, as with horses, and mouths, and pigs, and for the purpose of resemblance to the animals.
I say that castration is done in two ways: either by cutting or by making a slit.
In the case of castration done by cutting, the way of the operation is that we make a cut along the animal's tail, entering it between those parts that are soft and thin and hang down. And hold those parts in your hand inside where they are loose and do not show the touch from now on.
In the case of castration done by making a slit and cutting, you will have the animal and press the coja of the testicles of the other side.
And tie the suspensors, and insert them over each hole that is made by one cut.
And insert those plugs that will have excorged. And do not put anything over those of the cipher that is not the subtle cipher that is over the veins.
And this way of castration is better than the one that is done by cutting, for when cutting is too hard, it causes some cause in the testicles so that the animal wants to cry.
And when the plague is cured that it has entered,
The first source sentence is "Capitol .lxx." which translates
Of the cure for gout.
Hermaphroditism in men is second to two hands: one is called or appears as if it were the space between the testicles, in which a fourth female part appears in the quality of which it is made.
And some people see signs of urine in that space which is in the testicles' cavity.
In women, there is a special case: it is that which is on the pubis is like two testicles of a man, a part of the penis, and a part of the clitoris, all together.
And the cure is of three kinds: from two men and one kind of women. And it seems that you have inserted those tight ones between the thighs when you escaped from the pain of that, and that you cure those other plagues with the same care.
And in the second kind of men, where urine is found in the space between the testicles, there is no care or operation in it.
Chapter 21.
Of lengthening and of embellishing because of the causes of women.
When a rash is caused by natural causes that emerge and spread with the examination, and some are magnified in some women as much as in men and even more during sexual intercourse.
Then you have the excess of scratching at your own or another's rash and inserting your fingers.
And do not stop in the insertion, mainly at the root of the rash, so that you do not cause inflammation.
Then care for it as is cured by the diseases when it is healed.
The most horrible wound is flesh that is filled with blood when it is pierced, and it is often scratched in the same places as the cauda (and for this reason they are called "cauda malautia"); therefore, do not insert your fingers as you scratch, and cure it when it is healed.
Capital xxii.
Of the cure of leprosy.
Leprosy is that which does not occur in the woman, or if it does, it is very small. When it is natural or accidental.
It is accidental due to the disease that preceded it, or it is caused by an unadjusted skin or a subtle and sparse hair.
It is felt or in the prepuce, or on the sides of it, or on the root of it, or on the base of it, and forbids copulation and emission and embryosis, and forbids menstruation.
The cause of that pain is known by observing the menstrual cycle, if the prolapse is evident, it is appropriate; but if it is not evident, you should carefully examine that with the vagina or with the finger.
But if the prolapse is due to a subtle hair, and it is proper for the lips of the vulva, you should cut and disromp that.
And it is that you place over the lips of the vulva powders, and place a pause on the vaginal opening to prevent excessive moisture from entering.
And the woman should be over the bed, with the thighs extended, and extend the lips of the vulva as far as that subtle hair is broken and the prolapse is healed.
And take some wool and anoint it with oil and place it on that spot over there, and wrap it around so that that place is not yet solidified.
If the hernia is large and thick, you should cover that with either sand or marshmallow root.
If the incision is carnified, you should suspend that point with a needle and close it.
And if they ask you for medicines that stop the flow of your menstrual bleeding, give them this: white oak bark, ginger, and wormwood, adjusted to the size of the albuminous liquid.
And administer a large-bore catheter so that the plague does not solidify too quickly.
Hold that for as long as possible and administer saline solution.
And when it is cured, return to the other treatment for consolidation once it is healed.
And sometimes accidents happen in the more distant regions of other countries, and you should cover that with this method. When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
This appears to be a page number or section header, not a translation. It indicates that
Regarding the cure of hemorrhoids and of red blotches that occur in the vagina.
Hemorrhoids are appreciated more than the openings of veins that continually bleed, and they are also older and more common.
And I have already said in the division the species of those and the symptoms of those, and I will tell you which of those receive treatment and which do not receive treatment.
Therefore, say that hemorrhoids and pains occur when they are in the vagina and do not appear at the beginning, and there is no treatment for them.
Moreover, those that are in the vagina over which they feel a sensation, are those that have been treated.
And cover the woman with enough heat and extend her legs under the sheets or over a pillow, and insert them into those parts.
And if you need to grind on those ducts of the sinews of one of those incorrigible powders, it is necessary to do it with care and precision, as it is said to them.
And massage the patient's feet for an hour, and then take it in warm water.
And if the sinews are persistent, then make that powder with some sumac, some corns of wheat, and some honey, and a little of something else.
And if you need to make dough from oats and honey, then agree and make a plaster with it on the back of the patient.
And if the sinew is separated, so be it; and if not, then make it stick with two ventouses, and on its scarification.
And if you need to take wool and submerge it with some sugar of colin or sugar of angel or sugar of guarriguez, then apply it to the wound; and after, care for the wound until it is healed.
When you enter the room, take care that it is clean and sanitary.
This appears to be a reference or citation, but without additional context, it's difficult
When there is an accidental puncture in the largest vein.
Specific types of wounds that can occur in the largest vein include cuts, ulcers, abscesses, eruptions, hemorrhoids, fistulas, and other wounds. And you have already mentioned these diseases and their specific types and treatments in the division.
And please ask in this book about the one that appears in the largest vein when there are wounds that need to be treated, and if you want to know in what way the operation of the iron is done.
And please ask if the pain of the wound in the beginning is acute and accompanied by percussion and flechment, and sometimes it encircles and if that catches on to the sentiment, you should not neglect the perforation of the vein, and treat that as soon as the shock subsides and help over the matter inside that ends the accident.
When you want to lay the woman on a bed that has pillows; and recline on your side and adjust your hips so that they are at the entrance of the belly, and your thighs are expanded, and pause your knees away from your thighs, and let her lie down comfortably.
Then the midwife follows the right side and administers the instrument that is used to open the birth canal, in the form that will be found in those causes that they will make.
When you want to administer this instrument that you fix in the woman's womb, and it is not more than the pregnancy of the woman and leads to the thighs. If the instrument is greater than the pregnancy of the woman, then you should stop putting powder on the texture of the woman's womb so that it is prohibited for any instrument to enter the woman's womb.
And you should stop the vessel that flows in the midwife's instrument and that the midwife holds and turns the vessel around while it is opened in the woman's womb.
When the inflammation appears, and it is touched to the chest and neck, then you must cover that with something to prevent the wind from reaching the head of the patient.
When the disease is excreted, you must cover that you stay in the bath for a while with a vat of olive oil mixed with red or green olive oil, and leave the cloth in the section near the anus.
And clean the anus and over the wet wool that is in water where the moldy berries are built.
And it should be cured within two days, and when it is cured, enter the one that is suitable for you to be healthy.
And some waters are washed for the anus and the bath is taken with water that is distilled and honey, and in the water that is built with lily or long-standing aromatic herbs, and it returns to the enguent.
And if the water is taken in the anus, you must cover that you are not allowed to take the cure of the patient with iron, and have the cure that they have said in the division.

It is necessary for the midwife who is wise and subtle in all those causes, and who guards against error and deception.
And you show the whole figure of those, and what engine is in those for which it is significant and has been over it.
When the point is placed on the head per acupuncture, and that is very sharp for the woman and is made in that difficult part, and sometimes the virtue of it is blunted, then they apply a seal or the women hold it, and evaporate the smell of the fenugreek coitus and the olis humitz.
And insert the menstruation between the eyes that are small and sharp, or second the menstruation that comes out of there which is in it because of the humidity. And press the abdomen of the woman when she wants to give birth.
If not, then it is believed that the woman is christened with mucous of pigeons and mucous of fenugreek to the cizami.
Here comes the translation of the first source sentence:
If the doses of the foot are forgotten at the beginning, you should cover those points with your hand easily little by little. If the woman does not follow the intrament, you should place the foot on a pillow and lift the woman's legs up, and then place the pillow on the ground; and the woman should be held so as not to fall from the concussion.
If the doses are not turned and the foot is dead, you should insert those and remove the romament from the foot or lia the corset to the ma of the patient and remove that equality, so that it will be forgotten.
When the foot is on the patient's feet, you should cover that you push those with your hands, and you should convert the foot little by little, and you should engulf that, and you should take one of the legs and extend those little by little.
If the entrance into the thighs is not done well, you should command that he express it and make him remove that condition, so that it will be forgotten if God wills.
If you do not forget that they have recommended, then you should return the small one little by little inside when you pause that second natural figure, so that that one will not be forgotten and will be easier.
If it is prohibited to use all gout, then take some mucilage of aloe and dissolved rubber, and apply it evenly throughout the mortar with good percussion, and make lines of this gout in the female genitalia, at the base of the belly of the person. And if you find that bone in the watermelon, then it will achieve the hypochondria.
And when you have removed the parts from the person, then do subfumigation with mirta and sub-pause at that to the person. And when you have subfumigated for an hour, then do it on a cheesecloth, and make it tear and extinguish the mouth of the person, and take from there, and press the point below the belly of the person with a light compression, until the thing is as forgotten as it was.
The child's foot is laid down while one of the hands is held. The artisan should be in reducing the child's thighs, if you cannot reduce it, raise the woman and make that go away.
And if it does not go away, place the ointment on the bed, and press the thighs of the child with force, and apply liniments to those which you have recommended with ointments.
If it comes to childbirth, you should place that zest on the pillow, and study about the reduction of the mother's belly, and cut the second natural figure, and make the woman lay down and command the one who enters that he forget what he has come for.
The essence of the foot is to expand its parts and the thigh of the patient is in the middle of it. Make sure that the midwife holds the belly of the foot and turns it little by little, and it will be easier.
And when it is done and it is cut, and you stop over the chest of the patient that has been recommended oil and muscles.
And when you command him to push little by little, and when he has done it, place that zest on one pillow and command him to be inclined over the right side, and command him to be laid down; and make that stomach turn easily. The exit of the fetus is prepared on the side.
When the patient's labor pains become stronger after this maneuver, consider, and you should insert your hand into the vagina when it is emptied of water.
If the foot is hung over the face and the neck, then you must insert your hand into that of the emblem, so that it is not held and does not remain.
Then press the foot to the parts of the fingers that are inside the second one that covers it, and tell the woman to look at some signs, and if she forgets to apply pressure, then either God or luck will be responsible.
End of labor pain or pain of many fetuses. Know that some wives have seen three or four veins, and it is strange and hard to believe; not that there are any causes from nature, and I do not live.
And count those, even if they are multiplied, one second, and are separated by ciphac, distinguish those that enter the ligament in the belly of each of those and some veins that are forgotten as is a fetus by natural labor, and some veins that are forgotten by natural labor are like the ones that have been recommended.
And if they are difficult to see, the child's part you must follow and come to the one that has been said about the unnatural figures, then care for those as they have been recounted.
If the midwife is skilled and gentle, and knows how to facilitate and subtlety, and is intelligent throughout the figure of the person according to the doctor's preparation for the engagement leading to health.
Remembering that it is formed in the matrix from embryos and are aborted.
Some of them are formed in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth, and you must already verify that a woman aborts only at the fifth, and another one is formed in all, which causes a pain due to the measurement of the glorious savis.
And so it is necessary that the midwife know as much about this as possible, and therefore she will be able to do it accordingly.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what has been said in the division of medicine and is not deformed, and you have used for operation as much as you can, consider if the woman is of good virtue and not of those accidents by which she suffers loss.
When the woman is lying on her back with her head inclined and her thighs raised, then...
The physician should hold those parts or have them on the bed so that...
Then moisten the mouth of the larger part of the animal with humor, mucilage of aloe and fenugreek, and seed saffron.
Then give the woman the medicine with those humors and mucilage, and place it in the larger part of her body, and close it at the location where the nails are in the foot.
And the appropriate places for this: then you consider if the foot is prepared to be placed on the head, and you should keep your nails in the holes of the foot, or in the collar, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or further in the beard, or in the shoulder blade, or in the places on the back, or further in the hip bones, or in the groin.
If the preparation is on the feet of the patient, then in the patellar or in the muscle of the costals.
When the woman is lying down with her back against the wall and her legs spread out, and the doctor carefully inserts his hand into the vagina, he can easily feel the cervix and all the organs located in that area, as long as the woman does not have any pain or discomfort.
And then place and stay in the appropriate position another finger or the third one if necessary, to check for enlargement of the glands, and not to extend too far behind the rectum, only as far as necessary.
Be sure to examine the entire area, so that the examination of the patient is as complete as possible and as if it were part of the eradication of the disease.
And pay attention to the area where the extension is soft; and if any part of the patient is held, you should pay attention to the midwife's words that she says is true and insert your fingers there and rotate around that part that is held.
If the part of the foot is forgotten, then the fingers should be moved to the place where it was placed; and make sure that all of the foot is forgotten.
If the wound is located under another part of the body and cannot be reduced by compression, then cover that area with a cloth; and extract that part from there, taking care not to damage anything outside of it, and insert it either into the joint of the leg or into the thigh.
And cover the other wound with a cloth on both feet.
If the head of the tooth is large, or if it causes discomfort during the reduction, or if the end of the catheter is adjusted in the mouth, then cover that area with a cloth between the sharp spines and cut off the tip of the catheter, or use an instrument called "alundat," which is similar to the shape of other instruments used in the capitol.
And if the tooth is large by nature: and cover that area with a cloth, or take hold of that tooth with the alundat as has been said; and extract those bones with the forceps.
If the head is reduced and causes pain in the shoulder, then be careful to insert the forceps into the joint, as the humidity in the chest should be evaporated.
If it is not complicated, and there is no obesity, you should insert the needle as far as possible on the side that suits you best.
If the abdomen is apoplectic or in hydrocrotic, you should cover the hole that the moisture makes in it.
If the feces are on the thighs, you should pull out the end of the stool towards the mouth and turn it towards the mouth.
If the stomach is distended and the chest, you should cover that part of the drap that will be folded over your mouth, and release the stomach and chest through which the water runs that is in those.
If the other members are not in motion and return the needle to your mouth, introduce the needle into the left side; if the mouth of the patient is swollen, introduce it into the prepuce, and draw it out through that point, and insert it into the mouth of the patient, and then enter it with one or two pricks.
If the mouth of the pregnant woman is cut by scarlet fever, which occurs in the throat, you should cover it with something that does not cause pain; then, cover it with something that can administer a drizzle of wet humors. And apply ointments; and follow the patient in oils that soften and moisten.
If the wart is on the side of the toe, you should possibly be careful not to cut it; and apply what has been told in the living foot.
If it is not possible, you should be incised in presses, and extracted.
And do not leave any cause of injury to the second toe.
When you have completed your operation, apply what has been told in the cure of the scarlet fever that occurs in the throats of the pregnant women.
If diarrhea occurs, you should apply oils that are hot and moisten and apply the other cure.
And you have seen a woman in the belly of which was a wart, and placed over that focus another taken by hand, and the other focus is the same for the other. It happens at some point in time that a sting occurs on the skin; and it begins to swell as soon as it is touched, and then begins to tighten the bandage.
When I was called for the care of the patient and treated them for a long time, but the plague was not yet resolved.
Then you examined the patient with great care, and examined an bone, and passed your hand over it for a long time, and examined another bone; and you were too astonished to see that there was no bone in the stomach.
Then you thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Then you tried to cure the plague, and extracted the bones from the patient's body, the female existing in the disposed vaginas, and had been used for a long time, corrected by a small piece of bronze.
But you did not believe it to be strange, but rather that it is known and helpful for the physician who knows how to use the artificial bone in surgery for the care of the patient.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of vagina in which it is opened more:
This is the form of the strangler in which it is twisted, where the twisting has two virtues at the two ends of two strings: This virtue may be used to apply a stringent or an ebony or basswood ointment.
Then the length of one fist is two thumbs and the width is one thumb, and the length of one palm is a foot and a half, and the width is a little less than a palm and a half. And in the middle of two fists, there are two adjustments of those feet, of which the length is as much as a foot and a half, and the width is a little less than a palm and a half.
And these two additional things are inserted in the mouth of the patient so that it can be opened easily for those when you roll the prescribed ointments.
Another form of that subtle and lesser application might be:
This application of ebony or basswood may be made according to the form of forceps. However, at the end of those two additions, there are times when the length is as much as a palm, and the width is two thumbs.
When you want to open the wound, you should put the female on the bed with her feet hanging down, and then open it wherever there is space. Then open the wound with the instrument you have, according to the amount of force you want for the mouth of the wound to pass through, that is, the size of the hole you want.
The form of the words used by the ancients:
The method of pushing that forces the foot:
The method of measuring that is counted in the large head:
And it is assembled to forceps that the teeth are at the end, as many times as possible, and some are made long according to this form, as many times as possible, on the side of the teeth that is connected and measured. The method of measuring less:
The form of having a spine:
The form of having two spines:
The text appears to be a medieval medical treatise discussing various medical procedures and conditions. Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
The first line of the text is not in English, but rather in a language similar to Latin, It
Translation: All those instruments are exercised, and when you have multiplied the species of that and prepared them by the artificer, as it is placed in its operation and as much as you need for the men according to their quantity.
When the work on those instruments is already done, you must disassemble them, as the need for those cannot be excused.
The first source sentence "De extraccio de la segondina" translates to "From the extraction
When the abscess is pressed, you should command the affected part of the body to hold tight to the substance that it contains, and then apply pressure to that area with your hand over the mouth of the patient and over their nostrils, and if necessary, you can squeeze it.
If not, you take a glass and break it on the cover and put it in the mouth of the woman who is about to give birth, like this, as calm and raw as possible, and with a cushion and a camamilla (possibly a type of herb), and Arabic rue, Ceylon lignea, and saint-john's wort. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water in the glass, and place it over the fire.
Then place a gourd of peanuts in the mouth of the woman, and hold it until the vapor comes to the concavity of her mouth.
And make that person gag as has been said, and the second one will be removed quickly.
If this remedy does not work, you command the midwife to submerge her left hand in oil or ointment of mugwort, and insert it into the womb and wants to take out the second one, and when that is found, extend that hand little by little until it is no longer pressed by the woman's belly. When moving the hips to the right and left, it becomes easier.
And if the mouth of the pregnant woman is closed, we have already recommended the cure of birth and the medical treatment of the fever.
But if all causes are not forgotten, remember that you must not tire over that in iteration of abstraction, but rather ensure that this that is entered into the mouth of the pregnant woman lies in the cushion of the female, and applies to her engorgement and terafarmacon; for that will cause it to ripen in about a week and then dissolve and be forgotten.
And when it is ripe, it is given to the elevated part of the head and stomach, and that relieves the disease; and then it is administered under fumigations and appropriate doses for that.
And the old diseases have already been relieved by fumigation of nitre and dried figs.
The first source sentence translates to: "Form of an instrument that the woman must use to retain menstrual blood and the second one:".
When there is a need to see or to hear.
And the tip of the extremity is placed at the end of the candle and the wide end is placed over the flame, and the smoke is placed over the candle's wicks.
And hold onto that entrance while the smoke is consumed and then another one is entered.
For the cure of a non-porous child's buttock.
If the children do not know and the buttocks of the child are not porous, which are already subtle and smooth. Then advise the mother that it is porous in the part said to be that cipher; and if not, porous in the part of wet sand, and keep in mind that it does not touch the lizard.
And place your hand over that thick fabric in the eye and oil; and cure that with the oil that is inside when it is dry.
If you fear that it is smooth, place your hand on the edge of a canula for several days, and remove it when the child wants to urinate.
And if the smoothness of the buttock is for the consolidation of plague or cholera; then advise that this consolidation is solid, and use the cure we have spoken of in the cure and the plaster.
When treating the fistulas that are drained from the body, it is necessary to perform a series of steps to ensure proper healing and prevent complications.
The fistulas that are drained from the end of the body have a low node and large openings, which can be caused by the penis or in the space of one part.
And is it a fistula or motes?
And when that node is old and curved, it comes from the wetness of the white or subtle humidity, and some of these fistulas have certain penetrating veins.
And those penetrating veins are connected to water that is excreted and affected by wind; and some use the outlet of excretion, and it is most effective for those worms.
And for those fistulas, some veins are found in the space of the penetrating ones, and enter into the vesica, and enter into the meat of the worm; and for those penetrating ones, enter into the joint of the thigh and enter into the notch of the heel.
When it comes to knowing the difference between a penetrating and non-penetrating fistula in the buttocks, it is because you place the thin end of the instrument in the buttocks, and then carefully insert or hammer the iron or steel into the fistula when it is not turgid.
If there is turgidity in that area, then carefully insert or hammer the iron or steel into the fistula when you feel the tent or the hair on the thin end of the instrument entering.
And if you do not feel that at all or proceed with any cause of diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal distention as they have said, then you know it is non-penetrating, and you should take care of it.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the vesica or into the meat of the thigh, its meaning is that it is an indication of urine irritation and a prohibition of that location being solidified in medicine.
And if it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and enclosures of pain in the circuit, you should know that the tent enters here if there is no turgidity in the bone and enclosures of pain in the circuit of the opening; and that it causes a cessation of bleeding at all times; and that it does not belong to that medication, nor is it solidified in the enguent.
In all those fistulas that penetrate, there is no cure for all, and the cure for those is labor and effort of the skilled physicians over which they are placed.
In that which is not penetrating and not ancient, the cure is hoped for secondly if you recommend it to me, and what I have already used and proved.
And is that the evacuation of the evil comes between your thighs over the side of the abdomen and raises the changes of you inside, the buttocks are inclined to the belly of you, and they try to press or if it is in the fistulas turtulosity, within what you know the place where it goes.
And if that evacuation comes around the anus, you should know that you enter the true duty in the anus.
And if you feel in the true duty that the press is already discovered to penetrate, or another that you feel between the true duty and that evil, then you know certainly that it is penetrating; and then do not labor in that, and it is not in that cure, as they have said.
May I ask for your help in translating this line? It seems to be a medical term or phrase, but I'm not sure what it means.
This line appears to be a medical instruction or advice. It suggests using a subtle cauterization tool, such as a small cautery, on the opening of the fistula, following the previous instructions, and then introducing the ignited tool into the fistula opening. The author advises repeating this process a few times until it is known that all the adjusted and fistulated cartilages have been treated, as if they were the feathers of a quill.
This line seems to be a continuation of the previous advice. It suggests treating the inflamed and swollen cartilages within the fistula opening, as well as those on the surface of the body. The author recommends using medicinal treatments for the damaged and consolidated cartilages, and if it heals, it is good; otherwise, do not expect a quick cure from another treatment.
This line appears to be a set of instructions for performing a procedure on the fistula opening. It suggests inserting a tool into the fistula opening, if it is not already present, and then moving it between the fistula opening and the surrounding tissue, either cartilage or fat. The author advises cleaning the fistula opening with a cloth or sponge, and then checking if the tool is inside the fistula opening. If it is, the author suggests removing it and cleansing it.
And thoroughly cleanse those fistulated wounds which are assembled around the needle of pain and do not blame any cause for them.
If flow of blood occurs many times that comes between you and your operation when you open those wounds, then use the point that is and the pus instrument as an escharot or medicinal cauterization, which cauterization adjusts good doses habitually: it is the adjustment of those wounds adjusted, and the excision of the pain exception due to humidity.
And treat those that are inflamed on the border or within that location gets to the place where the scar is getting hard and consolidated.
And these medicines in which are sterilized and excised; when restored it is already cured and does not fear re-treatment.
If the fistula has gone through the anus of the thigh and is extended from the surface of the skin, then enter the liquid that is in the anus of the thigh and investigate what it is.
If centes the attempt and you enter with a glove or skin, and it is directed to the penetration, then do not operate on it unless second opinion and hope is given.
The cause is to be administered in one of three ways: either by cauterization as has been said; or by securing the entrance that allows for the conviction of the body part that can be most easily entered; and not processing so as not to cut through that which does not contain the lasso, and that may occur over the vulva and vaginal opening of the woman's desire; and to cure that which has been said by God is very difficult for you to become healthy; or by extending that membrane and tying the pus that seeps from that entrance as has been said, or by attempting or using another sharp-pointed instrument and tying those fistulas which are in the cut as can be perforated by you; and to restore the entire plague by cutting, and if the pus does not solidify, and rampant the urinary fistula in the part of the buttock, and it will pierce for the vulva. In every case, the fistula is closed according to this method: when you enter the instrument into the fistula, and around the circumference of the buttock at the surface of the skin and in the margin of the buttock, you hold the instrument with a perforated end, which is like a needle for preparing the wound according to this form:
When entering that wound or its surroundings, and appropriately entering the fistula within it to achieve the cavity of the body.
If you penetrate the edge of the buttock, remove the wound from that part as you insert the tissue into the buttock; and remove the end of the wound and adjust the two ends, and stitch each, and leave it for a day or two, and when you have inserted the wound in the flesh, stitch the end that is inserted between those extremities of the wound and that cause pain.
And after treating the plague when it is solidified and healed.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate using any means you have prepared, except for the penis, as that is not in your control; and after it is healed, make sure to stitch that part.
The shape of the spindle that is used to open the fistula: its curvature is sharp and the other side is not sharp, so it does not penetrate as much as it should, therefore it is not necessary, as often as possible.
When stitching up the veins that run through the incision of those.
Veins are seconded by two needles, either placed between the thighs as if they were made of carbon, or those are similar to fatty tissue. And from those, they are both small and large, and the incision runs through them all, and the threads, and the front of the thigh, and at the ends of it.
However, those that are closest to the thigh are usually made of few humors, of which agua citrica or a small piece of sinew is used, and is followed by the color of the flesh.
And the care of that which is closest to the thigh is that it commands the thigh to relax and to express itself within the time that the veins become visible and the wounds appear to you. Then take care and suspend the needles or those that you have in your hands, and apply them to those parts according to their sensitivity.
If the needles do not hold in those due to their humidity or softness, then take them with your hands as rough or sharp or smooth, and insert them into the wounds, and apply them to the edges of the skin, and powder some fine powder over them, so that they are in place of cauterization; or cauterize them after having previously cauterized the top of the cauterization. And accordingly care for those who are cured, entering when they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey excretion, you should stretch the flesh in the area where there is a small bite and wash it with water that comes out of the anus and obeys excretion more easily when the anus is relaxed.
If the hemorrhoids are causing pain in the anus, the cause of them is lighter, and it is because you are taking those with your own hand or with another person's hand, and you insert them, and accordingly care for them that have said when they are cured.
And if you have inserted them, know that you should make a suture for them immediately with this hand: take a fine needle and enter it into the hole and extract the hemorrhoids from the parts above, and let it penetrate into the hole of the other part, and wrap the extracted parts of the needle in the edge further from the hole, and stretch the hemorrhoid along its structure, and do not hurt the needle and extract it.
When gout is present in all joints, and not just one, it indicates that the sinuses of the body are running with that particular humor.
And if you pause over the anus and it is swollen or red, and you pause that part on the tail and command the patient to stop. And if you open that entrance that is closed; and when it is open, treat those wounds or other scars that were inside and are now healed.
And when they are old and not useful in that medicine, you know that those are the points of the spatula or the tube that you use to open them when they are wet and have been infected by those fistulas; and you cure them when they are closed.
And you should know that those are the pus that comes out when the first is inside and is not healed, and you cure them when they are healed.
You know that alirming is closed and not to be used unless the color of the chest does not resemble a clavicle, and it is found throughout the chest and particularly in the areas of the feet and ankles, and therefore for that pain you must stop the medicine.
And then, when it is certain that this pain is in the lock and is held by the fetters or by the nails, and is removed from its cause; and then, take care of this.
And if you want, cauterize the next one that follows in the capital part.
More of warts is an insignificant small, rough, round fistula on the surface of the skin, and many veins run through it.
And the treatment of this is that it extends or becomes infected there, or that it is irritated by that or by the one inside that box. And if you want, cauterize this, as they have said, with fire or with acute medicine.
More of termites is an insignificant small, rough, or large fistula on the surface of the skin that extends along the neck, and when the wart becomes inflamed there it resembles a termite bite and is cut around the area.
The first source sentence to translate is: "E curacio de lu es que prenguas una canula de pena de auca o de pena de voltor, e sia fort, e pausa aquela sobre la formigua entro que la contengua le cercle de la canula de las partidas de lu; e aprop revolveys la tua ma am la canula entro que inscidas aquo que es en le circuit de la formigua, e pauses aquela en le preon de la carn, e que eradiques la formigua de la sua razit.
If you wish, make a needle of iron or steel in this manner:
Be the tip of the cannula traced with great care, not perforated, wrapped around so that over it the learning of this is exposed and the rotation of that.
And if you want to cauterize the ant with the one indicated in the cauterization of the tail at the head of the cautery.
In the manner of the instruments that are administered to give cristers.
Some vaginas are made of silver or lead or melted or hammered; and some vaginas are made of those instruments small and large according to those which are administered, four that which is administered in the care of small children is small; and of that of those whose ends are rough or rough, the cristers of those are small.
The form of large and few cristers:
The top of the cannula of which is traced the bag is wide according to this manner; and at that difference, the bag is lied in different ways.
When the end of his penis is located in the anus, it is either not cut (not circumcised) or it is a leonine one, which is behind subtlety; and in the other side of the thigh there are two openings, and on the other side there is one opening, and the width of the opening is according to the thickness of the thighs, and it is quite wide.
If the bag in which the medicines for the animal's bladder or the wool of the sheep are placed, and the root of his penis is a palm.
If it is pierced by the teeth that revolve around it, and if the space that exists between the openings is the largest of the said one.
If it enters deep into those openings, which are far from each other, or if you surround them; and adjust the bag accordingly; and when it is placed on him, it should be tightly tied at the head of the priest between two distinct ones, and around each one of the openings: May the quality of priesthood that you place on the bag of the medicine, which is scaled according to the tolerance of the thighs; and keep in mind that it should not be too long nor too short.
When the patient is lying on their stomach with their thighs raised and supported, and a pillow is placed under their chest, and another person holds their feet, it is necessary to extract the cauterizing point. And if it is made of oil or albumen of honey or mucilage of fenugreek or similar, and it is inserted into the anus with ease, and the nurse takes the bag and expresses the liquid from it as much as possible before it is completely evacuated into the bowels, and then extra the bowels and the patient take their limbs to the side.
If the medicine fails to alleviate the pain, hold on to it as much as possible; and if you doze off for a whole night, you will feel better in the morning.
If you ceremoniously dedicate that in the remedies for abdominal disorders and the desiccation of the thigh, then you should repeatedly apply the cauterization where it is healthy.
And if in the anus there are exudations or protrusions, then you should be the ceremonious one among them and the one who sets the standards for the children.
In the treatment of the plagues.
And you have already said in the division of the treatment of the plagues that it is appropriate for the free, and you say that the cure of those who are equal to and with medicines according to the complement.
Therefore, say that the plagues are divided according to what is painful to the plagues and according to the location where the plaques are located.
And the causes for which you vetch are painful to the plagues are such as gout, or scrotal enlargement or hernia, or percussion, or lancing, or suturing, or semblance to those causes of motions.
Mays the afflictions that are in the parts of the body are similar to those that affect the head, neck, chest, belly, and limbs.
When you are recommending the cure for some diseases by pausing that reasoning and rule over other diseases.
And you begin with the simple headaches, where the reminder of the compounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, when you have a simple headache that is not fractured, consider whether it is due to kidney stones or appearance, and if the skull has been shattered, and there is a great pain in the head, and there are fears about that side having appendicitis, then cut the skull as much as possible, and do not delay too long; and extract from that part of the sinus second, and if it does not cause any other cause to be excluded, mainly if the sinus is infected, then it is better to leave it.
And if it is the opposite side of the infected part, and guard the sinus of repletion and of vomiting and of fatty foods.
If there is any restriction in the diet, then you should be less hungry and do not approach meat or fatty foods.
And rest over the wound, if it happens to be a gangrene, let cautery be applied, and pour in olive oil or vinegar of the kind that is antiseptic.
If you are sure of gangrene, rest over the wound, if it is recently sawn and the air has not changed, use the powder that I recommend in a small amount.
And if the air has already changed, rest over the wound until it is healed.
If the wound is large or was caused by an injury and not properly adjusted lips of the patient, adjust those sutures according to the suturing recommended by me for their sutures.
If the wound has already been exposed to bone and tendon, but there is no retention of the patient except for a small suspensory, you may incise it and apply appropriate care to the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in its place, and command the thigh to be cut into vessels in which there is fat: caps and form like them, and semblances of them, when it is composed.
If you find decay in the spine and it does not adhere to the bone, then you should cut out all of this putrid matter and remove it, and properly care for it.
If in these plagues an artery or vein of the kind that carries off the humor may become blocked and not be removed by physicians, then you should inquire about the artery, and if it is not cut open, then you should cut it open along with the spatium; and if this causes discomfort to those who have told you so, then you should cauterize within that sanc which has been blocked.
And if these plagues are simple and small, the cause of them is lethargy; I do not know whether you should powder over those this powder, which has become compacted, so that the air changes those.
And the recipe for the powder is as follows: ointment made from one part of ensem, from dragon's blood in three parts, and all mixed and crushed, and the plague filled with it, and held together by good constriction over that which adheres to it, and coagulated within that sanc.
And properly tighten that pillow around the head and adjust it, and do not move it while the patient is asleep, so that it does not cause discomfort to the patient during the treatment until they are cured.
And if you alone cut it, when you are not in my presence and there is no doctor present.
And this operation is performed on the largest wounds when it is necessary to place it over them and make them straight, and recent wounds of the same patient, which have not been altered by the air.
And if the air has altered them, and especially during summer, you do not see this powder in its position, nor does it cure those who have said that you hold it over those engaging points or over those poles of the flour of the other water and honey when they are getting wet; and it cures those in another cure when they are cured.
If you accidentally break the bone in the leg and it is small, you should take this out with your hand.
When you treat a fracture of the head with cold humors that cause inflammation, it is customarily called a "cold" by doctors.
Of the evils of the colon.
If the disease occurs in the colon, there is no difference in treatment, and it is similar to that of a simple head cold.
If the nerves or arteries of the colon have been cut or are inflamed, then avoid touching them unless it is necessary for treatment, as this can cause severe spasticity, similar to that which occurs in the intestines and bladder when they are inflamed. And do not press on the disease for any cause of all fever, as the substance of the nerves becomes inflamed and the continuation of it leads to the brain being affected, which is why it is pushed out from all members.
And if this disease is treated with unclean water, it is necessary to use alcohol-based or not-alcohol-based soap, and then wash the hands thoroughly with this soap, followed by the other fingers one by one, and then dry them.
When the plague is large, you should administer sutures or scrape the lips of the patient, and properly care for that part after it has been healed.
When the plague is deep or has occurred in the lower part of the abscess, you should perforate it in the least painful place.
When in the plague an artery is already involved and a flux of blood follows, you should separate or dry that part, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessary to stop the flow.
When in the plague the spinal bones of the loin have been opened and the veins of the collarbone are saved, you should adjust the lips of the abdomen with a suture over the root of the loin and do not touch that; adjust it as much as possible and reduce it to its natural figure, and stretch it evenly, and tie it there for a long time; and properly care for it in the places where it is stitched and excited after it has been cleaned.
When in the bone the plague has already set in, you should percuss it, and if in it there are fragments of bones, extract all that you can from them; and what is not apparent to you, tie it up inside after the plague has healed, and separate the limb and the flesh of the patient.
If the plague is recent, sprinkle powder over that powder which you have recommended. If in the plague there is a fistula, treat that with the powder of that which rememoration will come most properly to the head of the matter.
If it is percussion of lansa or cotel, and sometimes of the depth, consider if the plague has ventositat when the thigh becomes; you know that the plague is mortal.
And if in it there is not depth and the plague is recent to the head of the matter, you stop in it at the first hore polvera, and do not stress that so the sanc may not be held in the depth of it and return to the heart and may not disturb the thigh, but pause in it attracted, and delay until those doas are seen on the day.
And if the enguent is not present to you, you stop in the orrifici of the plague cut off for that which comes out of the humiditatz; and make that the thigh sleeps over the plague so that it runs aquo that is adjusted in it.
When the plague has passed three days or more and no spasm or tremor of the bad heart, nor stricture of the gut, occurs in the thighs, and sometimes other good positions of the body, you know that the plague is saved; and then cure that one with calm and the other curing when it is healed.
If the cure of the patient is excused and it has already been opened, you know that a fistula has been made; then cure that one with the head capital.
And if the plague is due to constipation or cotton and it is simple on the surface of the chest or thighs, you can cure that one with the treatment that is preceded by suture, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
If there has already been an incision in the bone and it has not yet been removed from the patient, you can tighten the plague and then extract those presses, if they are separated. If they are not separated, you can cut the presses that are coated with plague and the extraction of them is delayed.
When other diseases occur in the other parts of the body, the treatment for this is the treatment for gout that has been called.
From the diseases of the stomach.
The indisposition that occurs in the stomach is either great, small, or intermittent.
And a small dislocation is difficult to do with another hand, and if it is found that the reduction of them is difficult, then do not hesitate to make an introduction of them into their place as soon as possible, because they will be engrossed and the introduction of the intestine will be difficult.
And the better dislocation is intermittent, because in that it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is difficult in the special cases mentioned above.
Do you know that the suture of the stomach is done by four hands, and that fewer sutures are common that are suitable for sutures of other diseases of the body?
When two other wounds communicate with other plagues, but not in the abdominal wound itself.
I recommend to you every exposure and declaration.
When the plague is small and affects the intestine due to some cause of the thigh, and it is difficult to reduce it, then you are in one of two hands: either due to the difficulty of disruption as they have said, or when the intestine becomes inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And when that is the case, you know that you should soak that in water that you submerge a sponge full of humid earth alone, or that you soak in water with squash, cyperus, and spike, and embrocation, and apply to that the intestine if the inflammation is resolved.
And some ointments have been found that cause the inflammation to subside more than water alone.
And when you see the inflammation being resolved, then you hydrate the intestine with water in which the thigh is placed in the warm and mallow, so that the intestine can be loosened by a little cause.
If the patient's joint pain is caused by cold humors, then you should cut the inflammation with a small sharp instrument to prevent further damage to the injured blood clots.
The first treatment is better when it is not cut and does not cause bleeding, and is not an obstacle to the necessary and timely removal of the affected part.
The form of the instrument depends on the shape of the affected area.
One part of the sharp pain, and the other part of the non-sharp pain, and the subtle end, and not at the subtlety of the sputum, is harder than a few.
And when the swelling is amplified and comes out of the intestine, you should make sure that its reduction is in the natural form of the body, in the proper place, if possible, over there, which is better.
When the inflammation is wide and is in the lower part of the abdomen, you should make sure that you perform the operation on the patient's back, and stop the movements of the intestine as much as possible; and if it is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should stop the cap of the intestine and hold the chest as much as possible.
If it seems that the disruption is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then pause your attention and consideration for the most part in order to determine which part is affected.
And it is necessary that you administer this remedy for the great pains and the lesser pains.
In the lesser pains, pause this remedy that is for you prepared, and make sure that the minister is between your most painful areas, holding the displacement of the whole by his own hand and adjusting the lips of it, and make sure to descend from there to where it was and cause another suture if any cause another.
This is the common suture method: one that you grasp the cord, according to the number of the amplitude of the pain; and lay it from the extremity of the disruption of the said ring, and draw the cord one, another that you do not let yourself off in the two ends of the chain, as in the two ends of the cipher that you leave the chain of the parts of the intestine, when you make it penetrate into the part; and you have already added the two ends of the chain and the two ends of the cipher, and then make four orders.
If you tightly grasp the double knot in the loop of the string, and some threads of different parts are seen, and then add more thread lips and plaits for better decoration; and cut off the excess of this one and fix another hole in the same place, and tie it to the first one as if it were the first knot of the first loop; and do not stop until all the knots are tightened when the entire contraction of the plait is complete.
The knots are finer between coarse and subtlety, four of the subtle knots slightly incise the flesh; and the large ones are difficult to insert in the codpiece, therefore for this reason they must be both fine and large.
It is not necessary for the knot to be fixed at the extremities of the codpiece, because if the flesh is not slightly incised and the plait is pushed forward before its consolidation.
They are not prolonged by suture so that the plait is not prevented from consolidation.
When you have inserted the ends of the needles so that they do not pierce the flesh; and placed your hand over the expanded pulverized parts, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them inside when you know that the plague has become solidified.
These types of sutures with needles in the hand are convenient for small plagues, as there is enough room in the suture for one or two needles or around them.
The second suture is as follows: and it is that you administer through the suture to the four ends, from the neck and tail extremities, in a line, with an needle in which the thread unwinds in subtlety and thickness.
And when the needle has penetrated these four ends, reduce the needle of that member of which you began, so that the thread returns to the upper part of the plague, so that this suture is the second suture of the drape made of the fabric that the fabrics are strengthened.
When you pause between each stitch, measure the size of the given piece of cloth.
This suture is made by men.
This suture is made by cutting the skin, which was injured in the stomach of a man who had been bitten by a snake, and was the disruption of the plague major of a palm, and was eviscerated from the two sides of the intestine of the patient's location and was the disruption in the intestine; and then you reduce that which the intestine had suffered from the plague for twenty-four hours.
And the plague has consolidated in the space for fifteen days or more, and it is cured that and becomes healthy; and afterwards, it grows again over the years, and is discussed in its respective positions.
And the other doctors had said that they were not healthy; and by miracle, for example, if you did not cure it, where it was located in the place where there was no atrophy or any medicine, but rather, cover it with plague cloth twice a day and drink melted honey from the fire until the plague becomes healthy.
When a woman has pain in her groin and thighs, it is called "mays" (a type of suture). According to the story of Parala, there are two types of sutures that can be used.
And do you mean the suture for the abdomen, and enter the needle at the damaged part of the incision?
And when the needle penetrates into the abdomen and through the cartilage according to the right and long way, and the other end of the circle where you have inserted the needle; and let the other end of the needle pass through the other end of the rib from the opposite side.
And when you have made that penetration, then make another penetration in the other end of the rib opposite to the damaged part of the incision; and let the other end of the circle that is in this loop, and let the needle penetrate into the other end of the damaged part of the rib from the opposite side.
And let the needle penetrate into that penetration in the circle that you made in the rib, at the end of the rib where you made the penetration; and let the other end of the circle that is in this loop, and let the needle penetrate into the other end of the damaged part of the rib from the opposite side.
When you begin with this side and cut away that part which is at the extremity of the finger, and extract the bead of the nail which penetrates, and return it to its place in the same nail and cover the end of the finger that is on the other side; and extract that from the nail which is from your hand.
And make another incision and another, and make another incision within that which you have cut all of this that follows after that example.
And the sum of this suture is that you cut the suturing of cartilage which cuts the hair, and that you cut the finger a groove on the end of the nail, and that it sees another groove within that when it is complete.
The second kind of suture proper is that which is called the Gualia suture, and this is for the purpose of treating a fracture, and it is recommended by physicians because you cut that second semilune which they cut the bone with, and it seems that they add all parts to its corresponding part according to nature; and they apply the end of one limb to the other end of the limb, and this is done according to what I have recommended to you.
When you have inserted the needle into the extreme tip of your thumb, and made it penetrate into the nail bed at that point, and saw two extremities of the cipher; and then rotate the needle and make it penetrate from the nail to the finger through two extremities of the cipher.
And you should revolve those parts, and let each of the parts that are affected penetrate into the opposite part of the body through two extremities other than the one being treated.
This suture is better than the common suture, and is the one that was previously remembered.
This is the sermon of Guy.
And they may tell you that the abdominal suture is corrected by two needles, so that you enter through these with a needle, and then begin to introduce the needle of that which you must, and let it penetrate into the other side according to the suture of those that cause the closure of the corners.
And you know that when there is a displacement in the lower part of the abdomen, the suture of the intestine is difficult to do than in other parts of the abdomen.
And the judgment of medical treatment for the plague is judged by the other plagues.
The one that causes it is when you can get the plague recently by the air that is sacred and changes that, and reduces the intestines and bellies of that and makes them suitable for that, then stop on that earthly powder.
If the air has already altered the plague, then stop on that alcus which are those that come to your presence when they make hard pus and break the fields, and they become consolidated and mirated; and take care of that plague as it is the curacy of other plagues when it is cured.
If you do not have access to medicines, then stop on that thistle, pus that begins to get wet, cut it off, change the other two veins of the day, as it is for you and teach, when it is cured, so you will not need another medicine in cases disposed when the plagues are simple.
If you fear that the plague communicates injuries in the main members, then cover that you submerge the lion's wool in olive oil of tempered quality, or in rose oil, and stop it on the circuit of the loci which are between the ankles and leave the ass's belly.
And if there is pain or putrefaction in the thighs, then more cases should be done on that, cover that you destroy the black stiptic with a white one, and especially if the wound permeates the thigh and makes an exit penetrating into the cavity of the conquavit.
You should know that the remedy for a large intestine is different from that for the small intestine.
However, it is difficult to treat the intestine called "gout" with plague remedies, as it does not receive the same treatment as other parts of the body due to the great number of veins in it, its large size, its subtle nature, and its proximity to the natural nerves.
Therefore, if you are treating the gout with plague remedies, and you have recently used this method, return to your usual treatment to reduce the intestine's constipation.
If it has been some time since you used this method and you have already passed black or green stools, then you should apply the remedy to the affected area over the location that is denigrated by the sac, as fluxes of sand will come through the tissue, which contains veins and arteries.
And then insert that remedy into the other part, and pause the end of the cord before the end of the plague forum, so that over you is alleviated the attraction of the plague due to the pain of the tissue and the emission of the plague from the bowel.
This line seems to be a remembrance of the diseases that occur when one gets sick in the intestine. In other words, it is a reminder of the various illnesses that can affect the intestines.
When there is a disruption in the intestine and it is small, it is possible that it can be repaired by certain home remedies, as you have seen in the case of that which was affected in the lower stomach by percussion with a knife and was the plague of the part on the right side of the stomach, and the plague was an old one and caused a fistula, and it was a sign of the management and ventilation.
When you have completed the patient's treatment, regardless of whether it was previously treated in the hospital, continue to subtly insert that entrance where the hot bath is and the place becomes solidified.
If you see that the place is already solidified, then cover the patient's belly with the cloth that you will use to cover the accident in the abdomen; and do not allow any accidental injury to enter, and do not let food or drink pass through the mouth, and then put on the bathrobe and exercise in your own words.
It has been said to experienced ones that when the intestine is inflamed and small, you should cover it with this manner: and that you take large needles; and adjust the lips of the fissure and stop one needle over the lips of the fissure; therefore, when you press on them and tighten your mouth, you will cut the tip of the needle, which adheres and does not dissolve.
Then pause another fissure by the same manner, and do not stop doing this until you have made another fissure according to the quantity of the entire fissure.
And then reduce that and say the same about the hernia; and pull those annexed parts within the intestine as soon as the intestine is healed; and do not harm the patient's genitals.
And it is possible that the intestine is hidden in a subtle thing that is made of the intestine of an animal, because it is more like a needle; and it is that you grasp the end of these intestinal parts, and it is a waste, and reduce the end of that intestine to the end of the needle, and enter it into those needles and into the intestine of that patient, and reduce it in disruption.
And this maneuver of stitching is not only a second way of trust and hope.
If the hernia is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the subtle intestines, then you will not be able to simply subdue it, and it will not be cured from the entire body.
Of the cure of hernias and fistulas.
You know that all hernias and abscesses occur when they are inflamed and in ancient times, and an ulcer is formed, and it is not consolidated and gets bigger over time and does not separate, in any member, universally it is called a fistula and we call it that abscess.
When a fistula is formed by nature, it is hard, white, and smooth, without pain and with a cavity that conforms to the shape of the body; and for this reason it is called an alimentary canal, that is, a passageway.
It is in the alimentary canal of wet humans, which secretes mucus; and very little water is lost in a few hours. Some of this moisture is watery, and very little, and thick, and thin.
When all causes have been shown, and the symptoms of those causes are treated by doctors in their division.
And I ask you to tell me the treatment of fistula, which is made by surgery as much as possible.
I know that fistula can occur in all parts of the body; four out of those are fistulas that reach the veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the bladder, or the vesica, or to any part of the chest, or to any part of the spine of the two, or to any part of the joints composed of the muscle and the foot; and those that give proximity to the main member and resemble.
And for those of these fistulas that are followed by this method, they are of difficult diagnosis and not receive treatment, and occupation of the doctor is necessary and ignorance.
And if any of these fistulas has a depth that does not reach those places that were said, and you hope and trust in the treatment of the doctor, and you want to reach knowledge of the doctor, then try to remove it with iron or steel, and if the fistula follows correctly, and ask for that from the doctor.
When the fistula is tortuous, investigate whether that part of the subtle thrust is causing the levitation of the heart to be pulled and curved, deviating from the tortuosity.
If the fistula has many holes, it is not possible for you to understand what I mean about the point.
Christianize the wound with your wounds, for the humidity by which you cleanse that one must also cleanse the others and their corruption.
Inquire with great care, for which hand can you possibly identify if here you have bones or nerves, and is the cavity of the long or short fistula, or is it a fistula that has many holes and all of this is under the sum of your strength, your endurance, the endurance of the thigh, and the victory over pain, and the compression of the location, and the understanding and the causes of the accidents in the appendage.
And when you have been over all those causes, you will see the cure according to your confidence: and it is that you consider whether it is an apparent fistula or in its place long, distant from the joint, or from nerves, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from one of the parts which you say.
When you dry the fistula after it is opened according to the narcotic of the patient, and stay there that which is in that filtration and of corrupt carns, and that which is born in the slaughterhouse of the carn, or of the thigh and of appearance, and cure that part which is healed.
If the fistula is of long depth and is rectal, you should cover it as deeply as possible in the preon as much as possible, and modify all of your corrupt carns; and administer enveloped needles into acute medicines, and introduce those into the cavity of the fistula that you have understood with iron.
And use some of the sharp needles that the acute medicine burns all that is present in the cavity of the fistula of corruption.
And restore those that engender healthy carns within which is healed.
If it is not cured by that, you should cauterize that according to what has been recommended.
If the cause of the fistula is known and you must certify this, then you should inquire about that and dry that second part which has been recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or main member as they have said.
If the bones are discovered and found to be corrupt or blackened, then you should immediately treat that part where the corruption is located; and afterwards, cure that part with this remedy that it may become healthy again.
If it is not healthy and free from pain as it should be, then you know that you have not achieved the total eradication of the corruption; and then you discover the second part and examine it carefully, and make the reason for the change and the transformation of the body according to the same fortified tie, and afterwards restore it.
And if it is healthy, then so be it; and if not, you know that that corruption is in the depth of the body, which has not been able to reach, and therefore you do not have the means to remove it.
If the bones are corrupted slightly, or you are able to remove it, then you should know that you can remove it with these subtle forceps that are used for this purpose.
If those bones are hard, then you make the extraction of all those, and of those that do not have any cause due to your strength.
If you have any disagreement with any cause of cold humors and in their innards there is neither fear nor mistake, then insert those limbs or bones if they are here, and remove the bones.
If you are not prepared to remove the bones of your own hour, then pause over the water that wets those bones, and leave it inside that it is not within the environment of those bones of carns and limbs, and keep the water that is not solidified, and strengthen the cut you have made in your operation.
If you fear, pause over the cotton submerged in olive oil or cotton submerged in Egyptian anguish or in a cup of cold water, when it has been immersed in those limbs and bones are separated from the ablation, and from those attractions they are alleviated.
If it is a great bone that is like the bone of a hammer or a thigh or something similar to those, and that part of it becomes corrupted in its face so much, then reduce that resistance only by entering that which is left of the negro and corruption, and restore the water.
If the joint of the body is corrupted, and the corruption has reached the medullary part of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and that entire entrance into the location where the corruption has pervaded, and then cure that within which is consolidated.
And I recommend to you that you go to a man in his thighs so that he can hold it steady and assist you with your operation.
A young man of about xxx years old had pain in his thigh, and there were many bad parts on the material of the body that entered the thigh when the material was permeated by the thigh, and it was a large apoplexy, and I did not consider it as an external cause.
And then I extended the time for that due to the error of the doctors when the apoplexy was happening, and corrected the materials moved, and the cure was stopped at the place where the fistula was made, and there are some in those motions which all get perforated and the dryness of the face.
When the care of many doctors has passed over these years, and it was not known in this art, but when you were called.
I saw the wound of him and the materials that came out of it those wounds for great pain in his body; and all of his was completely destroyed and the color of his was citrine.
And then you inserted your hand into one of those wounds and the tentacled came to the bone.
And then you examined all the wounds and found that they had reached all parts of the wound.
And then you cleaned it and placed something over the wound that you had found a part of the bone, and corrupted that part, and it was already corrupt and degraded; and it was already corrupt a part of the wound that had entered into the flesh.
And then I understood that this was discovered and prepared by the bone discovered.
And you thought that it was not in the bone but only that corruption which had been cut off and hidden, and you had already fallen.
And then make sure the restoration of the plague is done in a consolidative way for a long time and it is not consolidated.
And then you will continue to explore and discover about the bones secondly after discovering the first, and you will find continuous corruption in the bones.
And take notice of that corruption appearing to me, and then you will do proper treatment for the cure and restoration, and it is not restored.
And then you discovered the other vein and did not stop inserting the bones little by little particularly and perforating the restoration of the bone, and it was not restored until I inserted around a palm of the bone, and that extracted from the marrow of the bone, and then restored it with medicines, and it became slightly consolidated and healed.
And it was not necessary to repeat the operation and section of the bone except for the disposition of the bowels and for the lack of tolerance of the patient and the pain of death, where there was an accident in all hours due to superfluity of evacuation without sincopi mala.
This sentence is saying that the cure is complete and there are no hard bones in the place of the joints; the good disposition of the patient's body is restored, and their virtue is returned; and they are conversed with in their positions and no harm is done to them in walking or in any other cause.
If the pain is in the chest, you must follow this second hand: and you take hold of the limb and stretch it at its extremity, and command that it extends in your; and then you cut off the limb with a smooth edge of the first limb; and you place that limb over the flesh that is left of the chest, and extend the wound so that it touches the parts left, and you uncover the flesh over the place you want to sew so that the stitch does not come out of the flesh.
And pause for a moment the table of the chest, where when you are doing it, it is not forbidden to sew that does not cut the rotten flesh.
And make sure that the stitching is over the rotten part little by little, where if it is in the concavity of the rotten bone and does not appear at its appearance in the feeling, and then to the stitching of another watched one.
And if the bones are rotten and not in the chest, then continue one part to another, and the rot is at the end or in the part of the other, you must uncover all the flesh of all parts; and then pause for a moment, and then sew that of the first part which is the rot when it is continued the stitching of the other part.
When the gallstone is located at the site of corruption, it is called a gallstone. This is what they have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, insert the point of the corrupt joint, and hold down the other part.
If the corruption is in the continuation of several joints, it is not necessary to act there for this reason.
If the corruption is in the chest of the patient or the foot, it is very difficult; but I advise you to find out where the corruption appears to you, and remove it, and adapt it according to each position that is possible for you, and make sure it does not cause any contradiction with veins or nerves.
You know what instruments and how to insert them into these bones are according to the situation of the bones, and their preparation, and their size, and their subtlety and size and fineness, and their hardness and rarity; because I advise you to prepare for all types of operation instruments suitable for that operation.
You should know that this operation means for you on the special of the instrument that you ask; when you have great knowledge and long study and experience with the hands of this art, and testimony of hands of diseases, where laborers already have you the avias by your measures that are convenient for you from the sturmentz in all disease.
And you should form in the end of this chapter the number of the instruments that you will use as simple as possible, those you will process for your prohibition which you will experience on others. Form of serra:
Form of another serra:
Form of another large serra:
Form of ray: The head of this ray should be according to the form of the star-shaped lock cap, and its points should be according to the form of the steel points.
And it does not seem otherwise that they are confricadatz with the caps of the joints when they are corrupted, or is the mouth very wide.
The second line also describes a medical instrument or tool, but it is smaller than the one described in
The third line seems to be describing a type of pain or discomfort that is caused
by a sharp tool that is placed on the surface of the foot and has a pointed tip, and the member of the body affected by the pain is also affected by it. This suggests that the pain is caused by a specific medical condition or injury. The fourth line seems to be describing a type of person or
a tool that has been used to create a concave shape. This could refer to a medical instrument used for surgery or a dental tool
The fifth line seems to be describing a type of tool that is smaller and more subtle than the one described earlier
The sixth line seems to be describing a tool with a curved tip, which could be used for various medical purposes such as cutting or scraping.
The seventh line seems to be describing a tool that is similar in size and shape to a tenter, which is a type of medical instrument used for
The ninth line seems to be describing a smaller version of the incisor tool, which could be used for more
different medical procedures. The fact that it is described as being similar to a razor suggests that it is a sharp and precise tool. The extremity of the tool is curved, which could be used for various purposes such as cutting or scraping. The tool is also displayed in multiple locations in the bones, which suggests that it is being used for a specific medical purpose.
This is a medicinal recipe for making bone meal or "bone powder." The term "form" in this context means "recipe" or "method," and "ray" is likely a misspelling of "rayon" or "rays
The end of the bone is tridentate and sharp-pointed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When it comes to the end of joints and the tightening of bones.
The end of joints can be caused by intrinsic or extrinsic factors, and if you have treated that corruption with those medicines and the treatment does not work, sometimes the corruption can leave the member that did not perceive any cause, it is possible that the wound entered there for that to be exposed to the mortality or malice that is greater defilement of the member.
The sign of the member that was affected, is that it becomes black inside because it is what has been burned, or it can be placed properly in the blackness that is inside that member which seeks to seize the entire body and takes hold of everything; and therefore you should have made an incision on that.
And if it seems that the corruption is caused by the impact of some causes poisonous as from the sting of the scorpion or of a viper or of a rabbit and similar,
And if the corruption or the impact is at the end of it, you should make an incision on it and do not give space to the corruption so that it does not enter into the body.
When you seem to reach the abdomen, then insert your hand into that of the umbilicus, and do not leave space for corruption to enter when you grasp the abdominal muscle of the arm.
If you need to insert your arm inside the thigh at the joint, then do so.
If another corruption passes and you sometimes turn the thigh, then that is the death of the patient; and administering another cause another in cure is a matter of virtue.
When it seems that pain is occurring in the foot due to corruption of the joint, then you should insert it into one of the nails.
If you hold the foot at the ankle, then you should insert it into the entire foot. If it may enter the knee, then you should insert the cushion into the joint of the knee.
If corruption has already spread to the knee, then you should not attempt to treat it, and let the patient die.
The method of inserting the member or compressing it is that you stretch the limb at the point where you want to insert it, and stretch another limb over the place; and extend the ministry to one limb at the points where you want to extend it, and extend another ministry on its; and you separate the flesh that is between two limbs at the end of which you have discovered all the flesh, and insert or compress as much as possible.
And if it is necessary to pause the bandage on the limb for all parts where it does not touch the place, and comes to the knee adjusted and cauterized.
If you happen to have a flux of blood when working, then you should cauterize the affected area or place some powders that restrain the blood flow on it; and return to your treatment once it is complete.
And then link the affected member to its corresponding part, and treat it accordingly when it is healed.
I advise you to attend to a man in the stool, this accident that happened to you and to me, which I mentioned earlier, was caused by the negro in the stool who was assembled for combustion of fire.
And that corruption first appeared in the stool when you had to hold the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself for his accident by pushing the curacy to the member with great vehemence because of the pain and the inflammation of the member, and he went inside the joint, and the fire was healed.
For a long time, accident happened to you that corruption in the indicated part of the stool.
And then I won over you, and so I returned to your superfluity that was paused over the part of the medicine, according to the world-renowned cosmetics; and it does not repercuss the superfluity and begins to go to another part where it began in the part.
When the surgeon inserts his hand into the patient's groin, and you do not want to expect any repercussion from that superfluity, and rather than fear the incision of the patient's groin, which was overcome by weariness, he should insert his hand.
And I thought that my leg would break, it returned to its place and came back to me that the one who prepared it had inserted his hand and closed the wound, and he was healed.
I have related this story only because it is an auxiliary over this malady, and that it has a significant meaning and follows the same course.
Of the treatment of the knee and the quality of clisterization with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in the fleshy parts of the body and the abscess is prolonged because it collects filth, and then it bursts and perforates, and the filth is exuded from it, and the location is sutured as if it were a wound, and the stitch that covers the wound is removed when it is soft like silk, and no corruption follows, and no pressure is applied to the bone or nerves or ligaments, it is called a joint, and no fistula is formed.
When however the space is prolonged within which corruption presses upon any member, it is called a fistula and does not close.
The cure of the patient is to sit in that position where the body rotates, and more especially when it is made softer and thinner, and more comfortable so that it does not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
If you hope that the position adheres and that corruption does not follow due to this, and if there are many faces in the codena, then take care of that with antiseptic.
And do you consider the sinus, and if it is large, and the brace that you see is of an unpleasant odor, then you cleanse that with Egyptian medicine which is of oil and vinegar and is received in a vessel, and are placed over the fire within which that medicine is roasted and turns into a specific smell.
And then take that which is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; and cleanse the medicine on the sinus, and stretch the applicator of it, and place the medicine in it for the number of hours you need.
And then take that which is precious and extract it; and do this for several days until the sinus is softened and the skin is moistened.
When certain veins are filled with ash, and you do not present this medicine to the patient at that time; and it is because you take the ash from the fire, and put water on it, and then roll it over the water with your hand, and close it when you think that the said vein is empty.
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash of the fire, you should roll that water over it and mix it with honey and a certain amount of sugar, and then roll it over that water again with honey mixed with sugar, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the intestine adheres to it, especially when there is excessive dryness and thirst.
And when you make gout for certain veins and you are sure that the intestine is already clean, you should roll that water over it to make it more nutritious for the flesh.
And it is because you take some of the ointment and dissolve that water in olive oil and see if it has sterility; or if you roll that water on certain medicines and other ointments that have the properties which I have written about in the book of ointments.
If the orifice of the sinus is straight in which the catheter of the urethra does not receive, you must enlarge that small piece little by little, and stop when it is wrapped in a Egyptian glove or a Basilicon cloth inside which it is amplified.
If the orifice is amplified, you must add the lips of the catheter and adjust the quantity inside the urethra.
If the orifice of the vessel from which the blood flows is elevated in parts, you must dry that in the lower part where it runs out, so that the blood does not enter inside the sinus cavity before it is formed.
If you cannot dry the sinus inside the bone according to your wish, then you must perforate that member with the preparation you have chosen, according to what is suitable for you and not to cause any obstruction to the blood.
Only that which is over the sinu's orifice, which remains constant in all hours that it causes pain because it adjusts to the gallbladder. And for what reason do you know if the pain of the gallbladder is due to it being full or empty, or not digested?
And do you also consider the location of that sinu, if in it the patient feels pain or not, and if it is in the appendix?
And when your medical treatment is prolonged in that manner, and you see the matter that is being placed over the sinu's orifice adheres, or if it has an appropriate adhesion, do you hold the displacement of the plague or the third day, and when the plague is displaced, do you change the cloth for another and renew the engagement?
If the sinu is long and has a subtle space, it does not despise the adherence of it, which is appropriate for the sanacio of the one, which is due to the slow generation of flesh in those places where there are plagues, and of those who have the contrari of him.
If the sinu is long and has a subtle space for three days, it does not adhere; and if the adherence of the sinu is delayed and prolonged, you should adjust the medicine with desiccation, and if the medicines are humid in their substance and vertut, they become dry as they are finally added, when they are adjusted with superfluity of addition of zegi.
And the most difficult part to cure is that which you take from the addition of dyafinicon and is dissolved in olive oil, and is over the voice of the one who has it, and is comfortable for him, and uses it accordingly.
And it seems to make an effect in that action, when there is no brac, and the addition of dyafinicon is not found, and when it is found, use it accordingly; or what you take mixed with aloe and enses, and throw all over it and powder it over the mel when it is heated, and line it above the drap and press that over the sinu; and line that with the mel that you have taken from when it was engross, and powder it over drap and press that.
This sentence appears to be describing a remedy or treatment in the field of alchemy or herbalism. Here's a line-by-line translation:
If the vein is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, you know that corruption occurs in the preon of the patient, and you have already made inquiry into the bones or other hard parts or ligaments; then, to cure it, use the cure of the disease as prescribed.
Of the treatment of corns and worn-down nails and incision of the fingertip added and section.
When the blister or gangrene is located on the sole of the foot or in other parts of the body, and it is prolonged and the cure is neglected, or it is postponed, or it becomes corrupted, and the corrosion spreads to the sole of the foot, and it becomes very corrupt, and it penetrates the bone that enters the smell of the fetid odor, and the extremity of the said lady is affected, and its color becomes black.
When you have that cold humor that has been spoken of in division and does not satisfy your cure, then cover yourself with iron to cover the excess that is rising from the ungla and cut the plagla as much as possible with cauterization, for cauterization is helpful in this matter.
If the bones are healthy and the hernia is full, and the parts of the hernia begin to compress the points of the intestine, then cut that part and leave it subtle on this angle of the hernia that punctured the intestine and push it inside, and insert it am easily; then hold it there until it is completely consumed by the intestine's corrosive medicines; and then cure that am entirely.
If corruption has already taken hold in the bones, then cover that you inscribe the bones with that and the excesses, for no time is ever cured when it is in those corrupted bones.
And if sometimes the corruption and corruption go into the disease, then you must inscribe that according to which is remembered by the nose, and cure that within what is cured.
When there is pain in the thigh at the end of the joint or limb, and the pain is very intense, you should cover that part with a cloth, and then cut off the outer layer of the thigh, and soak it in vinegar, and keep it moist until the cut does not penetrate into the flesh that you have removed from the thigh, so that when you apply pain to the thigh, and cause it to contract excessively in that place; and then care for that area with this remedy that reduces the pain.
When it is tightly fitted, which is found in the majority of men's bodies, very much flesh, and very much bone, or very much skin.
And the flesh of him is born in the joint's origin, or is the birthplace of his flesh from the belly. And that which is born in the belly of man is not bad, and this which is born in the joints is very bad.
And of those that are born with much flesh, the cut is less, and it is that you should make this cut on its own skin.
When the joint pain is present from birth, the treatment is difficult; therefore, keep away from the abscess of the same.
In the one who is not born from the navel, cover that you inserted at the beginning of the flesh of the other into the bone, and then press with one of those convenient cushions to this, and care for that which is healthy.
Greater stability is achieved when the movements between the parts do not cause harm to the newborn, or due to consolidation of plague or combustion of fire, or for semblance, therefore cover that this stability returns to its natural form.
And stop between them the enfused draps in rose oil so that they are not consolidated too much, and separate between them, or stop between them a thin layer of water under which is consolidated after it is covered.
And if it appears that consolidation occurs in certain parts of the hand, then you should dry that consolidation according to what is prepared and is suitable for the figure of the member.
From the insertion of veins, they are varicose.
Veins are varicose and the veins are large and full of melancholic superfluities that come to the limbs of the body, and the greater danger is in their movements, and most of all in the movements of the itinerants and laborers and those who wear them.
When you administer purification of the heart of black blood with some forceful excretions, and allow the patient to bleed from the basilica vein.
The second method of treatment for them is to incise and cut off that dark sin, and the other hand is to raise the vein and extract all of it.
The incision of the sin is made according to this hand: first, start at the beginning of the vein, and when the dark sin is resolved, which is fetid from the vein, and tighten the vein at the end of the buttock, and place a sponge in the hole, or in two or three places, and make a wide incision, and then raise the black sin from the end of the vein within it, and open it on the juice, when the sin is completely removed and the times have passed that you want, and it will tolerate the virtue of the buttock.
And then apply this, and command that he abstains from black blood-producing vegetables.
When the veins are swollen and it is noted in the thigh, then proceed with incision.
When the elevation of their limbs is second to this maneuver: you who raise the thigh, if it has any knots, and place it in the bath and rub the thigh with the hand that is wet from the water and the veins are swollen; or if it is exercised with strong exercise, if the bath is not for you at present, then enter that member is cramped.
And cut the cord on the right side of the vein in sections, either at the top or at the bottom of the vein, or at the base of the vein you must remove it.
And open the cord with anunces and clean the vein from all parts until it appears at the feeling, and you must see the appearance of the vein that sometimes turns black due to the negro.
And when you cut and remove the cord, you see that white thing which is the cord.
And then place your hand inside that leg which is raised and is tight around the cord, and hold that one with your thumb.
And cut another section about three inches long and clean the cord from the part that is above the vein until it appears.
And raise that and insert it into the rear part of that bone, and pull out that and raise that within which is the hollow for the second section, and pull out that from the section that is over that.
When gout is felt, which comes from the section that has been sutured or sutures from all sections, and you enter it; and you insert your hand into it.
If you do not obey and extract and raise, you insert a needle of double thickness and tie it to that and extract the, or insert later the rope and turn your hand around all parts where it is stuck. And keep in mind that it is not inserted; if it is broken, it is difficult to raise that hand and comes over the thigh for that reason.
When that hand is outside the socket, you stop over the location of the submerged hair plague under the oil and unoxidized oil, and cure that within which is healthy.
If the vein is twisted because of knots and not followed by straight ones as they have said, you cut that you push on all the knot part of the vein and the places of encircling of the vein, and suspend it above that when you raise that whole.
You must pay attention to your section that has not been pierced by the vein and does not cause pain; and use your caution in that.
The shape of the injury that is cut is:
It is not the acute pain that appears as with the uncs or from the extremity per se that does not harm the vein; and it is of great flexibility, if it were subtle, would pierce the vein due to its subtlety; there are in it excessive thickness of the limb as they have said.
Extraction of the vein of the thigh.
This vein is generated in the changes on low-lying lands as in the Ategi in Arabia and in the low, dry lands of India with little fertility and where there is no grass or bush.
And very much it is generated in other parts of the body than the changes on the lands.
And the management of it is of putrefaction that you see the spine coming out as venom from the snakes and toads and scorpions and vermin coming out between the spine and the flesh.
When the suspicion of the sudden occurrence of this vein that happens in the inflamed vein is strong, then the location is sutured; and the vein begins to leave from the location of that vesiculation which seems to be like a plant.
And then, when it appears at the end, you should cover with your hand over that one a piece of cloth of the kind that is the horn of a dragon. Enter into it, and not on that one but on the horn suspended from the cavity.
And so many causes as you see in the parts of the body, cover with your hand over it and not on that one. And if it is prolonged, then you should make a point on it and cut around it; and do not make that point if it is outside and inside, but if it is inside, then make it and insert it into the flesh and cause an abscess and gangrene in the place and ulceration bad.
And if it is treated gradually and is extracted little by little, enter if it is outside the skin of the body and does not return to the body any cause in the body.
When this vein is found in many men who have a length of twenty palms and it has been discovered by me that one has more, it is called a varicose vein.
If it is discovered during the patient's treatment, you should insert the ray into the wound in the body and perforate that long wound in the chest, entering if all of this water is removed from the matter, and administer putrefaction to the area for a few days with medicines; and cure it with the cure of bandages.
This vein has some ramps, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and it goes to that orrifice, and it is called a varicose vein, and it is found in many orifices.
And then cure that as they have said in the division and with this water that is given to them.
From the section, it is said that veins are generated under the skin and it is called bovine agony.
This malady is called bovine malady in the same way that our bovine malady is called because of the few veins that are found in the belly and the lungs, and it spreads throughout the whole body and devours, and it is shown to the feeling of the member in the member when the codon is disrupted and it comes out.
The generation of the child is caused by putrefaction of certain humors, such as worms, snakes, and slugs, and feces in the belly.
And it is feared for the malice of him, that when he goes into the body and rises to the head, and comes out through the nose, if one presses too hard on it and enters and destroys the nose, then many unwanted movements occur.
And when you want to heal that and remove it, you should not do so if you do not have the ambulance and appearance of the member in your hand, and then cover what is over it and what is further away from it with something firm, and wipe it off and take out that part.
And if it is inflamed in the flesh and does not bleed, then you should pause the cauterization with a hot iron on the spot where it hurts, and the main cause that is feared is corruption of the member which corrupts the place as they have said.
If you see that it has passed through the tip of the nose, then you should press on the upper part of the nostril with something firm, and wipe it off and take out that part. And cover that this member uses for the modification of the chest by medicines evacuating putrid humors, and keep away from things generating putrefaction.
When the body is divided for the sake of healing from illness.
This disease is prevalent in our country, and it causes pain in various parts of the body, and it spreads from one part to another.
And you have already seen that which I recommended. I was called to attend a female patient in a village, and I found that her arm was swollen with a small inflammation in the funis vein, and after an hour, I saw that the inflammation had disappeared as if the silver had been removed from its place.
And then the pain in that place disappeared and remained in the muscle, and it stayed like this for an hour.
And I corrected the other arm so that it did not touch the other arm.
And I advised you to turn the entire body so that you see the other side; and it was too remarkable of the exchange of the body and the speed of the member in the member. And you had already seen that in the best parts of the body, following that maniac, but you have seen that those who are most in pain are transferred from member to member. When I did not see that this was a man's disease as in the female.
When I first realized that it was not a regular gout, but rather a specific type of gout called "gout of the female genitalia," which is characterized by the presence of many veins and secretes a pungent smell, it became clear that this was not an ordinary case.
It is necessary that this curative remedy does not appear in those who are delicate and have humors of the veins that are not fully developed.
When you wish to administer the curative remedy and the patient feels pain, do not immediately apply it as they have said, but rather strengthen the area and place your hand on the part and then cover it with something soft and gentle, and cauterize the location.
If you do not see the wounds of the feet, apply your curative remedy to the affected area and expel the ventilated and excremental substances, as well as the pills of fetid odors and serapies and semblances.
Extraction of seaweed.
Seaweed is diversified according to species and locations in the body where they are found, such as those with large points, petites, concave, and narrow ones, as well as those with three angles and those with tongues; and those with stars.
When the serum is affected by the sausage, and passes through the bones, and the skull is covered with the cyphac, which causes damage to the brain due to excessive heat, scotomia, vertigo, and fainting in the limbs, inflammation and weakness of the tongue, spasm and permixture of understanding and vomiting of bile, and the word is separated and destroyed by the abscess, and the voice is destroyed by the plague, and it appears to be wet white-like polls in the appearance, and the semblance is seen at a distance with the carn.
If you see these symptoms in the patient, avoid the cure and extraction of the sweat, unless it comes out.
When the sweat is found in the chest, it is likely that it is coming from the left side of the mamilla, and if it does not cause any pain, do not worry; and the movement of the sweat resembles the movement of the finger, and the plague is black, and the cold feeling in the extremities, and the sweating, and sincopi; and then you know that death is coming.
When the sweat has caused the lung to become full of black blood from the plague, and the vessels that are closest to the collar are affected, and the color of the thigh changes, and the spirit expels great amounts of air, and there is an attraction for cold air.
If the sweat is found in the belly pouch that is in the chest, and the pain occurs in the small costas, and there is a great amount of vehement pain and spitting, and not all the muscles are affected.
If the stomach is empty, it is necessary to take a large dose of the drug to treat the diarrhea caused by an un digested food.
If the stomach is empty and it remains in the stomach, and there is any pain from the plague, or the cloth, or the intestine that has been disrupted, and there is no hope for the removal of the stomach.
If the stomach is empty and it is excreted in the bladder, and the urine is discharged due to any abnormal cause, and there is severe pain in the thighs, you know that it is fatal.
The other parts of the body are similar to the face, neck, and groin, and the spine and vertebrae, and the shoulders and elbows, and the hips and knees, and the joints of the limbs, which are saved by the major dispositions when the stomach does not obstruct the veins or arteries and is not venous.
And you recommend this to me that I have seen of the nature of these stomachs, so that it means for you about the cure of this.
The cause of which is, for in a man there was a swelling in the lacrimal duct of the eye, and you extracted it from another part, then the grays of the auricle of the ear, and it became well and did not harm the hollow of the eye.
You extracted another swelling from a Jew who had it in the grays of the inner part of the eye, then the eyelid was pulled back, and the swelling was already hidden and not noticed by that one except for a small part attached to the eye root, and it was a great swelling among the sharp swellings of the Turks, and it had a leon's head in which there were no auricles.
And the Senate was the Jew, and it did not harm the eye socket.
You extracted another swelling from a Crestian man who had it in the groin, and it was an Arab swelling, and that was the one with the auricles; and then you inserted it between two thumbs, and it was already submerged in the groin of him; and then you subtly touched it, and extracted it, and the Crestian became well.
And I extracted another story from a man who was hanged in the stomach, and thought that he would die for that; and so, after thirty days had passed and no change occurred over him due to his dispositions, I examined the patient and treated him, and he was cured and did not suffer from this accident.
And I saw another man who hanged a woman on his back, and the plague was solidified over him, and after five years, the woman was found in the crotch of the thigh.
And I saw a woman who hanged a womb on her stomach, and the plague was solidified around him, and it did not change in his dispositions during pregnancy, and the woman did not suffer from any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man who hanged a womb on his face, and the plague was solidified around him, and the womb was solidified, not causing pain here, and it seemed to be like that.
And I extracted the womb from the man of the first king who was hanged in the middle of his nose and had already died at the end of a short period, and the entire womb was hidden.
When you were called to attend to the patient's case, it took three days for the swelling of the ankle to subside.
Then you treated the swelling of the ankle with great care; then you inquired about that which was subtle, and did not feel it; rather, you felt a sharp pain further down, and then wondered if that pain was from the end of the ankle.
Then you examined the location where the most attractive and digestive parts are located, assuming that this is the location of the ankle, as it affects that part.
Then you did not become concerned about the significant accident that occurred at the location; and you continued to apply pressure over it for several days without causing any accidents; and the swelling subsided, and the pain in the ankle decreased over time as you walked and felt the foot with your hand.
Then you placed your hand over the acute, corrosive medicine for several days until it was fully digested, and you applied it to that part, and treated the swelling, and examined the ankle further down, which clung to the sole of the foot.
When you have adjusted yourself in the abdomen of the plague for that acute medicine, after I saw the end of the sweat, it passed by my time as much as the space of four months.
E aprop pus that the plague was amplified, and I could enter the forceps into it, and remain there, and not increase in thickness, if you do not cease to subtly and invent on that maneuver of the engine over that am manieyras of engens pendre lu am forceps descentment faytas, since that form of those at the end of the capitol, when I extracted it; and then restored that plague.
E alcus metges judged that the cartilage of the nose was not restored, and you restored it and the plague was consolidated, and the thigh was healed for the whole health, and did not return to it in any cause.
E yeu recomti to you the quality of extraction of some sweats that pauses this rule and has significance about this that I did not say, that is, the parts of this art and the definitions of that are not understood in the narrative nor can understand those free.
The first source sentence translates to:
When you say that joint pain is not outside the members in which it is fixed, unless by two hands: either by attraction to the place where it is wound, or by the opposite part.
When that which is thrust into the place where it enters, or proceeds from flesh, and is then drawn out and withdrawn, causes pain.
And if you do not comply with the prescribed time for the cat, it is likely that you will lay it for several days until the flesh around it is desensitized and the attraction of the cat and its exit are overcome.
And if it seems that it has settled in the bone and does not comply with your prescribed time, you will lay it for several days and gradually desensitize it to the attraction and motion on each day, and it will eventually be withdrawn.
And if you do not comply with your prescribed time for several days, it is likely that you will lay the cat for as long as possible in the circuit of the seal in that bone of all parts until that location is amplified by the seal, and then extract it.
If the wound is already inflamed in the location of the chest, and it is inflamed, you must investigate that cause, and if you feel that, you should attack that cause with those tools that are most suitable for the attraction of the wound.
And if you cannot reach it through the constraint of the plague and because of its length, and there are no nerves or veins here, you must then apply pressure on the plague once it is amplified and it is possible to extract the wound.
And if it is held by the hairs that are around it, you must cut through the flesh in which it is bound entirely; and then invent on this, if you cannot escape the flesh in the fracture of the hairs and in the turn of those that have come out.
And when you administer the extraction of the wound in every location where it is, you must use your own twist and forceps on all parts that pass through that comes out of that obstruction; and subtly use any subtlety that the wound is not cut and that it is tight in your difficult attraction of the wound and of that extraction.
If you cannot reach that spot in your time, you will have to stay there for several days until the parts that are on the circuit of the body become moistened, and then return to that place where you were able to reach. If you have any objections to the flow of blood, you will administer that which has been said for the cure in the capital.
And guard your virtue from the insult of veins or nerves, or cords, and administer medicine to the utmost of your ability to prevent the escape of the sweat; and make it easy, calm, slow, and firm as you can and as you have been commanded.
And therefore you make the sweat to escape by that which is following the figure of that which has to be the caustic of the sweat in it, which is less useful. If this is not possible for you, administer that which is possible for you by the figures.
The sweat that is escaped from the opposite side of the other part, or that has been treated by any part of the other parts, or causes gilbosity of the sweat by the feeling of the part that has been pushed out of the cord several times; then you press on that; and it is the section according to the quantity in which they seize with the forceps; and then attract it, so that it becomes slightly firm.
When the joint is held in place, you should gently pull on the other side, and extend it as much as possible, and then pull out the hand.
If necessary, stretch it for a few days, and repeat it as needed.
If the head of the joint is stuck, you should gently push it in that direction.
If the head of the joint is broken and needs to be fixed, you should insert your hand into the wound, if it is too painful, use a needle to hold it in place, between the concavity of the joint and the socket of the joint, and then gently push it in that direction.
If the joint is concave, you should gently push it in that direction, until the joint is fully seated in that position.
If the joint is infected, you should cover the entire area with a cloth, if possible, and clean it thoroughly, and apply any appropriate treatment.
If the joint is in the chest, abdomen, vesica, or costal region, and it is necessary to touch it, and it is possible to cleanse that area, you should cleanse that area and keep your hands away from it, and then extract it and close the wound, and if there is any discharge, apply appropriate treatment, and care for that area until it is healed.
The first line can be translated as: "Form of forceps that are those which are sharpened at the tips.
When the ends of their limbs are like those of a broom that are painful when we touch them with our hand, we should not ignore them.
And those are specific types of pain, large and small, few and many, according to the size of the limb and the tightness of the muscle, and the width of the joint.
like pain as if the intestine of the limb is stretched and is pushed away by that.
Of fleabite of the veins.
The veins of fleabite that are usually fleabited are the ones that are most often fleabited, those that are in the head xvi, those that are in the auricles, those that are in the two temporal arteries; and those that are in the two lacrimal veins called aspicientz; and the prepared vessel in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the end of the nose; and those that are in the collar; and those that are in the chin below; and — these are the veins that are called algelic —; and those that are at the end of the tongue. When the veins that have been cut in the thighs are seen, four of them are a cephalic, and it is necessary to use the wild rose; and the people call it "the vein of the head," and it is narrow, and is a migrian vein, and is composed of one ram from the basilica, and another ram from the cephalic; and that vein is called by the people "the vein of the whole body," and the basilica is the vein that is paused in the domestic latex, and is named "citillar," and the vulgars call that the vena del ventre; and the funis of the thigh, and it is placed over the focil, and it is that in which the fleubotomy is done, and it is that which appears above the poutz for the manifest appearance; and salvatella, and it is the vein that is between what is said about the auricular and the little dit, and it is in two rams.
And in the foot there are three veins; one of those is where the curvature of the wild rose's thigh is, and the second is sophena, and its location is the latex domestic's camba; and the sciatic vein, its location is where the wild rose's thigh is; and in the camba there are other venas resembling those.
The cause of the inflammation is the blood vessels that are located in the navel, which are also known as hernias, and they migrate and become carbuncles and ulcers of the old neck.
The quality of smearing those is what you recommend to me: it should be thin at the top of the thigh, and thick at the top of the thigh in the occipital region, where the veins are ample and good for stretching; then tightly bind the thigh in one place with a bandage that passes over the anus and the parts thereof, and in two places below the ears of the head; and if you want to do this as you said, and if you feel the ends of those as you said, here it is attempted.
If you take hold of the harpoon, and that is the one that strikes, and then introduce that into that part of the vein that comes to the bone, you will hit the fleshy part. And then raise your hand and hold the vein and the codon at their parts, and insert the vein where you inserted it before. And is the length of the insertion the quantity of two fingers or around that; and you will feel the sinus as much as you want.
And then tighten the powders and push them inside where it is cured.
And already and previously at the beginning of the freeing, the insertion of those and their cauterization.
More of the arteries veins that are the templars' jewels, the advantage of the fleshy cut is to emigrate to ancient and evil, often sought and accumulated, and the course of sharp and abundant effusions at the ends.
And the quality of fleshing those is second to what you recommend to me: tighten the thigh, and as soon as you feel the arteries veins at the sensation per manifestly apparent and it is demonstrated that the hands of their ends the same said; and then you will see that.
If you have already lifted the patient's shirt to expose the veins in the areas indicated by the previous diagnosis, and inserted the needle at that point, and raised the vein; and inserted it according to the quantity of your need, then run the sanc second after the amount of your necessity.
And remove the dressing from the thigh, and pause on the previous diagnosis about the vein for an hour, and pause on that part with cloth and powder and strain that is under great constraint, and leave it to heal within that part which is cured.
And if the memory of them has already been preceded by those that have been inserted, and the attraction has begun at the beginning of freedom.
And the benefit of vein puncture on the forehead is similar to the vein puncture on the cranium for old wounds of the face and for migraines and spasms and unpleasant ulcers.
And the quality of the vein puncture is according to what you recommend to me; so it is that this thigh is strained with a stick inside which appears the vein; and hold the instrument which is called the fossor of which this is the form of you:
Pause the point that is on the tip of the fossa over the vein and percusses over it with the thumb or the other cause in the manieyra of the patient, and let the sanc run according to the quantity that you wish; and remove the perforation of the thigh and strengthen that inside which is cured.
And some incisions are made if it is necessary to open the fleubotomy lat, but do not cover that the fleubotomy is not sharp like the others, rather it is of a blunt end, and the fleubotomy is second to the transversal, four bones are removed and forcefully cut in it the fleubotomy when it is subtle.
The beauty of the two veins that are the lacrimals of two eyes for scabia of the eyes for rogor and sebol in the eyes, and the malauties of the face.
And the quality of the fleubotomy is that the thigh stretches the col sieu am one benda, and the fleubotoma those, and you should be standing over the head of the patient.
If the surgery is made according to the transverse section of a longitudinal one, which is not meaty; and if the flebotomy is done subtly, then the end of it is cut off.
When the patient's pain is at its peak and they are under your care, stop running, hold their legs, and stretch them out in a certain way, and then remove any restrictions on them.
Many of the symptoms of nasal bleeding are attributed to acute fever and violent sweating, as well as skin diseases of the face, eyes, and lips, and especially when they are old.
The quality of the nasal bleeding is that the throat is stretched and the patient holds their nose with their left hand, and the fleubotomy is held subtly long and placed at the tip of the nose on the second right side of the nasal cavity, where the vein does not feel any sensation, and where the pulse begins to flow so much.
Cover that you recently made the patient's throat smaller and smaller and ran over the pain according to your need; and then apply it to that area for a certain period of time, where it is gradually restored.
Many of the benefits of nasal bleeding are that it helps to constrict blood vessels, prevent the onset of leprosy, and treat various skin diseases and infections, as well as corrosive ulcers.
And the quality of the abdominal incision is that the abdomen stretches out on either side of the incision; and the surgeons should be on the head of the abdomen, and the abdomen should be placed on a sheet.
And the abdominal incision should be as long as the abdominal incision is small piece by small piece; and it should be extracted from the second portion of the flesh, and second time if necessary that it is required to be, and it should resemble another vein.
And the incision should be made in the muscle and stretch the veins in the stricture of the uterus so that the abdomen does not become distended, and let the wound enter the mattress where the plague is healed.
And the benefit of the abdominal incision of the veins is that it causes small postings and pustules in the mouth, corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers in the nose and in the circuit of the body.
And the quality of the abdominal incision is that it strengthens the abdomen when you open it, and stretches the thighs of the patient with a needle, and turns the lips of the patient and looks at the veins of which one is on the left side of the lip and the other on the right; and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of the nose, and it is less in the circuit of those dark veins; and then inscribe each with an inscription.
If you have any doubt, and do not know which of those is the case, you should understand the majority of them, and the manifest signs of them.
When it appears that the veins are swollen in the lips.
It is customary for the veins to enter the tongue further, which is similar to the flebotomy of the head, at the glabella, at the uvula, and in the mouth.
And the quality of flebotomizing those is that it follows the mouth between the teeth, lifts the tongue, and looks further at the tongue, from one side of the vein and the other, and the color of each is turning black.
And then flebotomize each one; and keep in mind that you do not end the vein when flebotomizing those, because further away from them are the arteries.
And your veins that are flebotomized in the thigh are customary for all men, and the flebotomy of those is done with two hands, or use a mirror or a small instrument for subtlety; or use a mirror and a ruler, and this is the shape of it:
This line appears to be describing a medical procedure involving the opening of veins that are full of blood and appear large, and also those that contain clotted blood. The phrase "Forma de fleubotomi mirti" from the previous line may be related to this procedure. However, without more context, it is difficult to provide a precise translation.
This small incision is of less latitude and has a subtle extremity, and corresponds to a small vein subtle that contains some subtle citron.
When the improvement of the basilar vein surgery is mentioned, which is one of the three veins: it extracts the blood from the lower parts of the abdomen that go to the knee and the chest, and from there it nourishes the intestines.
And the flebotomist, when performing the flebotomy, should guard that artery and be over-themed in it, for if he errs and adjusts the puncture of the flebotomy, it will injure that artery and cause blood to flow, so that not to flebotomize that artery before flebotomizing, he should cut it at the same level.
And if the basilar vein does not appear manifestly, you should cover that and move to the other, or circle around some ram you have; or perform the flebotomy at the end of the arm where it is manifest; and cut that after the flebotomy as they have said.
And if you want to perform the flebotomy on the metheglin, you should cover the stricture of the arm that touches the location within which you know the location of the fingers, and place it over the one that is needed; and tie the arm and cut the vein with a concave cut by the flebotomy according to what they have said; and be careful that the percussion does not hit the space of the artery's location.
When you see that the limb is tense, inflammation occurs in the location you have observed, and it expands the artery, and therefore swells.
If the blood flows in the wound during dissection as if it were golden water, and you perceive that it is from the artery's blood, and you cut and place your hand over that part for a long distance; and then remove your hand, and if the blood lets out, four streams of blood will let out, and you should hold the arm tightly and press on that.
You should guard the patient's leg from the wound and keep it covered for several days after the surgery to prevent infection.
If the wound does not heal, and sometimes you are not able to seek medical attention for a long time, you may need to clamp the artery yourself if it appears; or if the extremity is swollen, and it is swollen, and press on that area with your hand and hold it there over the location of the vein that is causing the stricture and the pulvis for another day.
And if the wound heals, that is good; and if not, you should treat that which precedes the rememoration of the location of the abscesses that have formed from the dust.
The removal of the wound of the patient is difficult in positions that are not suitable for the small location of the plague and the possibility of the limb of the arm.
Sometimes the removal of the dark vein is the best way to extract the wound from the sublingual part of the neck and to the posterior part of the chest; therefore, it is composed of the ram of the basilica and the ram of the cephalica, as they have said.
When the knife is held over the patient's shoulder in the incision of the knife, four are the nerves; and if it adjusts to the point of the incision and crushes the nerve, it will cause the patient's stupor, and it is difficult to cure the patient, and the less he is cured, the more this nerve moves; and if it is hidden in the chest of some men and is subtle and not shown, you should cover the knife with your hand when you cut the incision with the one that you cut with, and avoid the nerves with your strong hand.
If the vein is between two nerves, you should find the vein in length.
The advantage of the cranial vein incision is that it relieves head pain and consolidates the maladies of the eyebrows.
And if you want the knife to pierce the cranial vein or the facial vein, then this is the blood saved from all the veins, and it is not shown the artery nor the nerves.
However, it is more likely that the patient is mistaken in some cases, when the fleshotomy is not performed in the first percussion, and does not notice it in the next one.
The first of the qualities that you should know is that fleshotomy is not administered except in conservation of health and for hope of the patient and caution from the occurrence of maladies, and that a proper fleshotomy is in one of the veins that are in the thigh, it is: cephalica, dark, and basilica; and that a proper fleshotomy at the beginning of the first day, after dinner, and in autumn, when significant signs of repletion appear.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. This is because the cold humors cause inflammation and swelling in the affected area, leading to pain and discomfort. The condition is often treated with rest, ice, compression
However, if the condition is not properly managed, it can lead to further complications and discomfort. This is why it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible, whether it is during the day or at night, in any hour or any time. The doctor may recommend various treatments, such as medication, physical therapy, or surgery, depending on the severity of the condition and the patient's overall health.

The following text is a medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. I will try to guess what the text means and translate it line by line into English:
E aprop considers in subtlety of humors that cause this, if the joint is swollen, with redness and heat, and if medications are available to alleviate this.
When entering the bath, if no one forbids it or is exercised by a certain exercise to make it subtle,
And pause the fleebotomy of the day's pain, so it is time for dinner, as they have said.
And tell me that this pain of that day should be guarded in that day of all animal accidents, as it is anxiety, anger, fear, and all corporal accidents, as it is labor and unnecessary suffering and pretense for them.
And at his seat, the causes should be present in the use of the which is customary for men to have aroma and odor and to have balms and semblances as after the quantity of possibility.
And follow the fleebotomist on a cushion that is placed or if that cushion of the one who should be fleebotomized.
And extract the hand, and press that on his arm with his own hand, and stretch the limb with the fleebotomist's three veins; and stretch the muscle with the corner and involve those veins.
If the stricture is treated, that is, if the stricture that does not engulf or the stricture that is superfluous, you forbid the flow of sweat; or it is a mollification, and you forbid the body's heat.
And it seems that the stricture, that is, if that which gives the appearance of a fleebotomy presses on one's own limbs between them as they enter, and that the veins are inflamed, and are declared in the feeling.
And the fleebotomizer is made of the same kind of bronze that the fleebotomy is made of; and he stops the fleebotomizer on the left side of the vein, over the place where he wants the fleebotomy to be, so that the vein may slip a little, and the percussion is set aside as much as possible of the veins which are most affected by the fleebotomy, and of those which are full of ventosity, and when you pause the fleebotomizer over the vein, and the fleebotomizer is released, it does not strain the vein, and if it does, the vein is stretched.
And so, in order that this forceps may be stopped and be found in all these causes.
When you have paused the incision, if the vein is easily bleeding in one place, stop; and if not, continue to another vein nearby or over the area, if it is not too swollen.
If the place is too swollen or the thigh is stiff, you should massage it for a day or two, and do not stretch the limb too much, as it may cause inflammation or discomfort. Do not force the movement, but gently stretch the muscles.
If necessary, repeat the incision if the blood is flowing well.
If the incision is small and bleeds slightly, and you fear that it will not stop bleeding with the amount you need, continue the incision in the same direction and adjust the amount of blood in the incision a little at a time, and if the place is swelling, you should make smaller incisions.
If the place is already swollen, do not continue the incision, as there may be no reason for you to do so; and pause over that part of the saw, where the hand of the saw is, and listen to the pulse of the patient's arm. When it is better in this place than oil and the others.
When it seems that the patient is suffering from gout, which blocks the veins of the corset and causes swelling in the chest, and when one of those parts is placed over the area, the corset subsides and turns around when it becomes large.
If a large abscess is formed in the area of the thigh cut, and many pustules appear, and especially for that which has not been blooded except by that pustule, or in the spasm of the small vein, and you open it and place your hand over the area, wetting it with water and salt, a few cloths, and then press on it for an hour, it will be dissolved.
And so that the cut does not worsen further, complement it with the vein of another vein or with another vein.
If, after several days, there is no improvement in the area, do not worry; and if you want, place your hand over that cause of a cold or mire dissolved, or a cause of sweat from the mentastre or calamine or semblance of the one.
When visible movements occur after the appointment and prominent symptoms appear, a basilica-level surgery is required.
When you have finished opening the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands, then pause your work there and if you find that the compression you made over there is too tight, it is likely that blood has flowed from the artery sanc.
And apply here what is recommended for the pain, so that the place becomes endurable, and apply care to that part in the other treatment when it is cured.
And cover that part with what comes from the sanc to all men according to the quantity of their virtue and according to the color that appears in the sanc, and then apply it.
If the sanc is black, then you apply it within when it is red; and if it appears to be large, then apply it within when it is subtle; and if it is sharp, then within when its sharpness is removed.
And cover that part which is large and hard and requires the extraction of sanc in a vein, where the fleubotomy of the vein is amplified and the fleubotomies are left open.
When one is in the cold, it is best to have the opposite, and cover that with warm trousers, and make sure that the leg is straight.
When the best treatment in vein thrombosis is administered, it is better to make a transverse section rather than a puncture.
This manicure for vein thrombosis is saved from blood loss and nerve injury, and it is praised and saved as a successful vein thrombosis treatment at a later time and place.
And it is customary to perform a small incision for fleibotomy, and you should use a small amount of infusion in one or two milliliters or simple saline; and extract the blood in three or four vessels.
And if there is a need for complications, you should take infusion through the fleibotomy into an escarpment of mirra or an escarpment of aromatized honey or in an aromatized escarpment with specific aromas such as cinnamon, ginger, and similar scents, or in an aromatized and odorous escarpment.
And if there is a need for sincopi of fleibotomy, and it is caused by the scent of blood, you should know that you take in the urine of meat and an aromatic escarpment subtle; and use aromatics to some extent, and be sure that the pain is at the same level.
When there are other causes mentioned in the division of the head of the sacrum for evacuation, use those other causes.
When the arm is to be cut and the vein dissolved by a second view, cover the part of the vein that undergoes the fleebotomy for motive evacuation, and the virtue of the vein is frenetic, which evacuates the sanc little by little, so it is after the quantity of the virtue in the continuous days.
When the arm is to be cut and the vein is dissolved by a second view, and the heart is strong, then make the vein pass through approximately seven hours or nine of the first fleebotomy.
When the vein of the heart is to be cut against the direction of the part where it bends, cover that it happens on the second day or the third.
When the heart is already cut and is sharp and sore, and causes fever, cover that the vein of the heart is cut in one view and is cut with great quantity and is amplified the apoplexy when it happens; and you will have preserved all the conditions of fleebotomy; and you must hold your hand over the corps of the vein to prevent it from dying in place of sincopi, four views later when the fleebotomer is ignorant and negligent.
When you want to slide the arm and remove the second section of the sleeve, as the wound of the vein is closed and the pain is difficult to bear, then press it with great force and bend your hand over it, as this causes too much pain.
If the wound is second-degree; or if there is much pain at the acuteness of the wound which coagulates the sac in the vein; or if you pause over that with tympanic alfarach, or sagzenea, and compress that with a leugierament within which the sanc is outside and out.
And if the vein is gangrenous, then press that and do not touch within that gangrene which is sedated.
And if it is necessary to remove the sac secondarily, and not excuse, then you press that over that place or on the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "the thigh's cord" is lanced in place of the black or the basilica, when it is not hard or thin, as it is composed of those.
The quality of the incision in the leg is that it introduces the doctor's hand into the wound, which then encloses the vein and makes the vein visible.
When the bandage is placed on the swollen part of the limb, and the incision is made along the short transverse line, not horizontally or along the length.
And is the incision wide and is your fleebotomy the one you make on the joint of the other leg, a little?
And if the flow of blood is prohibited, then you repeat the leg in the cold water and let the blood run in the water until you achieve your need.
If you were in the summer days, then you would excuse the repetition of the leg in the cold water, and the month would pause the blood flow in the water during winter.
And the fleebotomy of this vein is saved that of all the other veins, four hours later it has not been pulsating nor nerves.
And the fleebotomy of the knee joint is compared to the maladies of the foot.
And the quality of the fleebotomy is that you strengthen the leg with a limb or with your own, as you have placed it in cold water, when the vein is inflamed and is demonstrated at the same time; and the incision is made along this transverse line; and if not all are not noticed in re.
When preserving the wound, do not leave it until the last moment, for if you wait too long, the nerves of the wounded parts will become bare of flesh.
And if you iterate the wound in the tail of the serpent and let it run the sand through that, if you do not iterate the sand in the tail of the serpent, the sand will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and it is prohibited to flow.
And when you extract the sand according to the amount of necessity, place your hand over the vein or sal, so that it is not solidly consolidated; and it seems that you will do this in all parts straight.
The advantage of the wound of that part of the wounded leg is that it is similar to the diseases of the thigh.
And do it in the wound of that part of the wounded arm as you have done in the other.
The advantage of the vein section in the wound is to those diseases that are in the part behind the arm, as it is in the more severe diseases, and in the diseases of the nails and ulcers of the thighs and old cushions, and they resemble those diseases.
The quality of the fleurbotomy in this case is that it allows water to enter the body and flow over the friction point where the veins appear; it also corrects the joint of the foot with a pointed cautery; and the location of the vein should be marked with the same point, and it should ramify in the face of the foot's heel.
Therefore, use a wide ramus or the cushion for the thigh, and place the talus there, as it is better and will allow for more comfort.
If you perform fleurbotomy on the face of the foot, be careful not to touch the nerves that are located there, and pause your fleurbotomy at the point where you would like to insert it, as if you were inserting it.
And so, may your fleurbotomies be successful.
If the use of sinus is prohibited, then you should remove the foot from the water and let the sand run over that entrance where it has been evacuated.
If the fleurbotomizer goes off course in the first cut, then you should repeat it at a different point, where the location is safe; and do not fear the malicious one, only be careful of the nerves as they have been told.
When it seems that the other foot has a tongue (glossitis).
When from the sciatic vein, the location is where we have said you must leave the tail of the horse in the wild part of the cavity.
And the advantage of the gout operation is that it relieves foot pain when cauterized.
And the quality of the gout operation is that it enters the wound, and quickly and firmly constricts the thigh muscle of the wide part within a certain distance from the tail of the horse, which does not appear except for this reason.
And when it appears, you should make the gout on that second incision that is as possible and the next vertical one, and it is better; or if you are making it through the skin or through the flesh, the location of the wound is salted.
And it is used by many men who are skilled; and if you cut it, and it does not appear at the sensation of everything, then make another incision on the thigh, and that which appears in the two of the foot next to the big toe and the little toe.
And be careful of the nerves, and let the cauterization run the amount you want.
And if you want to relieve the stricture and place your hand on the site of the incision, so that the wound may heal.
Of wind and the quality of the food you eat.
Wind is of corn, or of ears, or of hay.
And wind is caused by certain manure: one of them is a scarification and the extraction of sanctuary, and the other is a ventilation of their scarifications.
And this wind that is made from their scarifications is caused by certain manure, which can be of dung or of manure.
And the winds that are made from their scarifications and the extraction of sanctuary are fourteen parts of the body, of which one is in the part where the wind is placed, and the other part is the lower part of the neck; and the wind of the lower jaw is below the mouth; and the wind of the spatula; and the wind of the alohoster, and over the anus; and the wind of two fires, and two brands; and the wind of two cavities; and the wind of two holes.
A venepuncture does not extract blood except from the thin, scattered veins in the flesh, and therefore does not harm those, as it is done through phlebotomy; nor should it be considered that a venepuncture is a fire or its flame within any other joint that becomes inflamed upon the removal of which the entire body is evacuated.
If it causes pain due to inflammation or continuance, apply the cure at the beginning of the month and at its end, and in the same place and at any time that it may be needed.
When, in any case, and especially if it is in the third or fourth month of the month, then, as you command, I will make a point that has passed through the day of two or three hours.
When the windpipe of the neck is affected by gravity, it falls into the head and descends to the feet; moreover, it is believed that this is an evacuation of the entire body.
This wind is in the location of cephalo-tomy of the head.
And it is not necessary to use that which is of cold complexity, or in the quality of catarrh, for that great benefit.
And therefore it is not necessary to use those vials, and in the heads of those who have bad skin rashes.
Moreover, it is believed that if one continues to look at that, it will cause forgetfulness; and therefore it is necessary that you command the wind to pause its suction for a short time in the parts where it was, so as not to generate forgetfulness.
Moreover, windpipe of alchemist is in the location of cephalo-tomy of the black vein and the basilica: and therefore it causes asthma, and the constriction of the airways and the scissure of the sternum of the airways, and the throat, and the evacuation.
When the windpipe is blocked with a small piece of food, and if it is not removed immediately, it can cause weakness in the chest and stomach.
The windpipe of the gallbladder is responsible for causing accidental pains in the head and neck, as well as in the eyes, ears, and temples; it is instead located in the area of the abdomen.
When you command the windpipe to stop pressing on its own, instead using scraping, so that it does not insert the artery and cause blood clots.
The windpipe can cause alcohol to be left in the mouth, as well as corruption of the gum, and a resemblance to the symptoms of diseases that are present in the mouth, and it is instead located in the area of the abdomen.
The windpipe that is placed on the teeth with spoons can cause causticity, which is made by repelling heat.
The windpipe that divides the teeth of the fingers can provide good results for the fleubotomia of three veins, which are located in the abdomen, black and capillary, where those arteries are placed that are present in all those veins, and those thin veins from other veins that are placed inside when the attraction is on the three veins.
When commanding the ventralist not to make too much incision, that the location is stripped of flesh, and then his nerves and arteries.
It is a wind that is used to blow over the thighs and confesses to the blood of the buttocks and the ulcerous pus further.
And order that the ventralist be a great wind, and that it be of earth, where the location requires a deep cut; and very much the subtle winds are scarified in scarification.
Many winds of the small changes per manifestation, that they irrigate the whole body, and confer comfort to old pain of the hips and the uterus, and the vesica; and provoke menstruation, and confer comfort to bothor and ademil; and stand in location for fleshotomy of doas sophenas, and alahorcoben, and doas cavilhas.
In the meantime, it depresses the whole body and makes sinciput in some men.
And of the winds to alahorcoben the juvenation is predisposed to the juvenation of the winds of the small changes.
The quality of the position of the windpipes is such that they pause the windpipe at the beginning of the view and succumb to well-timed temptation, and do not prolong the position of the windpipes, less pause those slight moments, and return them strongly, and that the humors come to the place by unexpected arrival. When you do not cease to apply this and continue until you see the wound has become inflamed and swollen, and the gangrene appears.
And you scarify and repeat the small incisions one by one, and consider in the position of the chest.
Fourthly, that person who has flesh of rare parts, know that you cut one vein and do not plug it, so that the place is not ulcerated.
And command the veterinarian to enlarge the incision and make a small one, and facilitate the wound.
If in the wound there is much swelling, know that you cut several incisions, and the first one should be made to the way of subtility to the wound and its transparency. Less in the second to the examination of the extracted wound from the wound.
If the wound is very foul, make sure to cut the last incision so that you can drain the pus.
Finally, when we want to extract the wound little by little or a small one, a single incision is enough for us.
If you wish to perform a surgical extraction, make a deep incision; and if we found that this wound is large, then cut through the area with a well-made incision.
The term "scarification" in which the depth of the wound is determined solely.
If that of which the wound is rough, dark, and narrow, then cut so that the holes for the vents are larger and more open; if it is in summer, use almond oil or oil of viper, or oil of chamomile or cinnamon; and if it is in winter, use narcissus oil or oil of lirine, or oil of camomile, or of the sanc, and make them like that.
If the excess is large, cut it off, and if the oil is dark, use olive oil, or balsam oil, or almond oil, or anise oil, and make them like that.
If the vent is large in size and has fleshy tendons, cut so that oil is not allowed, and cut so that the holes for the vents are as far away from the vent as possible, using water, or water mixed with soap, or water with alum, or water with chamomile, and make them like that.
When it comes to the matter of gout, wash your hands with water that is neither too hot nor too cold, or with water that is sweet and has a scent of rose or lavender.
When it comes to the matter of excessive fat, wash your hands with water that is neither too hot nor too cold, or with water that is sweet and has a scent of rose or lavender. This will have a soothing effect on them.
And cover the wound with a bandage; having covered it, make sure to keep it moistened for about an hour or for a few hours, and make sure that the wound is not dry.
What should be done before cleaning the wound of a person who has had a bloodletting?
Before cleaning the wound of a person who has had a bloodletting, consider the following: if the person is in a state of anger and has a hot sanc and inflammation, then you should take cold causes such as vinegar, honey, and sage, and apply them to the wound. After that, you can add some water and let it sit for a while, and then apply some ointment or salve.
When the patient's movements are calm and their breathing is shallow, and their veins are thin and transparent, it is a sign that they are in good health.
And if the collection is free of obstruction, it is a sign that the patient has plenty of urine and that they are able to use it moderately, and that their movements are not obstructed by urine or feces, and that they do not have excessive thirst or hunger.
And if during the day of vomiting and diarrhea, urine is greater than the amount of food taken.
And if urine is given in some hours to adults with typhoid fever, or muscle relaxants, or alcohol, or at any other time during vomiting or diarrhea, so that the main limbs are comfortable and the sickness is alleviated; and it does not matter if they drink water.
Moreover, the vomiting that is caused by his scarification is vomiting that has been stopped by his stomach, and over the heel and big toe, and over the umbilicus, in the locations of the joints, and the pox of the wide one, so that these members do not suffer scarification on them.
When it is not desired for the sake of pleasure of the member, but for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief of pain in the member, and for the relief
And when it has been placed over the thighs when they become weak or sore, that for the sake of pleasure one may obtain softness and remove the soreness from its place.
When it seems that you are standing over the knee and the table, you must be careful in those surroundings.
These views are managed with great care only; and some views are managed with fire.
And some views are managed full of water in the wounds of the table.
And that's why the view is expanded and is pushed out, it's water or water in which the herbs are placed according to what is convenient for this.
Form of view managed with fire: the width of the orifice is twice the size we have formed; and the quantity of the preon is the largest of a palm; and it is in the middle of the, in the location where it is in the circuit, the largest of the, the thread is small second the quantity that enters into it a needle.
The pain of the joint is made of rose or lemon, large margins, lion, teeth and thick because you do not lead the member to its position on it.
And if it is at the midpoint of the transverse cross-section of rose or iron, where candle is placed in the fire.
This wind is much greater than that which has been recommended; and the fewer men who are needed for this surgery, the better the patient's condition and the easier the operation.
The winds of the infirm and the debilitated are different from those of the young and robust;
The quality of pressing this wind is to focus the fire on the member that extends the flame of dry wood gently with a little wax, and place it over the edge of the thigh transverse in the edge of the wind, so that the fire is ignited around the part where it does not burn the body of the patient.
And if it is placed over the thigh of the patient, and it is said that it is over the truss that has been told, then when you have the winds and do not indicate that they are in that truss, and that the vapor is on that truss, the wind will be so dissolved.
And you should light the fire according to your own hand, and repeat it if necessary.
The less wind there is in the illness of plenty, and without transverse or truss, and not maintained but full of water, and placed over the member only.
This is the method of it: And as this wind increases, so does its benefit, because it can receive a great quantity of water.
The text you've provided appears to be a medieval medical treatise written in a
The text you've provided seems to be in an old form of Latin or a language similar to it. Here's a possible translation into English:
When it comes to the quality of using those that you have found bloody when they are in the clothes of unclean women.
And if their menstrual periods are long and painful, and they do not experience any discomfort in the abdomen of those; and if the uterus is evacuated at the beginning of the operation and of the vents; and if the thighs of the patient are frigid, then:
And when they are full and case.
And if it is possible to succor the place with the wind, it is less dangerous in youth.
Otherwise, wash the place with the wind that agrees with it and is moved by water; and it should be shaved and expressed.
And if the belly of the patient is prolonged by the caginess of the bloody puss, and it becomes thick, then you should dip a cloth in the clean water and place it over that area to prevent the thickening from coming out.
And if the patient multiplies, you should powder over the vitriol that has been made, or guards and resemblances of its causes stigmatic, within which the patient's abscess is; or they are placed over the place with the legs of peas that are excocized, and they are frigid within which the peas stick to the place, and the abscess is closed.
When necessary, if there is a need for a bloodletting procedure, change those.
If bloodletting is prohibited by suspension, then pierce the location with a needle or insert a thorn in the areas that are safe to prick; and after that, pull them out, taking care not to prick any sacred spots.
When you want to powder them, sprinkle a little of aloe or salt, or ashes, and then blow.
Now begins the second part of the text: from restoration. This chapter is necessary for the art of medicine; and it is a restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
Oh, son, wise that you understand this chapter is full of false claims and vulgar words and those who do not pay attention to the free books of the Ancients or read only one letter.
And for this reason, this manuscript of the scientists in our land is private; and you have not been obliged to do so at any time, and I have not admitted that afterward, except by long study of the free books of the Ancients and knowledge of their understanding, within which I extracted the science of those.
And accordingly direct your attention and studies to the length of life.
When I first began to describe in this chapter all that my own science and the knowledge I have gained through my own experience contains, I thought it was appropriate to open this to you and relieve myself of the burden of writing; and I opened it at the end of writing; and I presented it at the end of declaration; and I formed it in various forms of the stitches that I administer in that place, as is done with addition of declaration, just as I have done in two previous chapters.
Capitol primier. - This line is not in the provided
Summae et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium - This line can be translated as: "Summary and collections of bone fractures. This passage is discussing the importance of understanding and following the instructions in a medical text, as it contains valuable knowledge that can help those who are wise or eager to learn this noble art.
I say that when an injury or dislocation or twist or sprain occurs, you should first apply a bandage or splint or tie to the affected area, or else use any other means, if nothing prohibits it, as best as possible with virtue, or if it is that which caused the injury to be severe, or if it is due to old age, or if it is due to strong heat or cold.
And let it be filled with herbs and meats of rabbits and hares and rabbits; and forbid fatty meats and fillers if they fill the veins with sinews, since you are sure of no apthema caut, and if you fear effusion of matter to the member.
And return the thigh to its original position in the first course of care that it usually occupies.
And when the bone begins to be restored, you should ensure that the thigh is not nourished with innutritious foods of little and heavy nutrients, as if your foods were flour cooked in water, and milk, and beans, and viscera of cows, and honey, and fresh fruits, and gross and similar to those, and this diet is made to produce coagulation of fracture with lemon and honey.
1. You know that bones crack when they are in men and women of the first vitality and the elderly, and the elderly, if they are not continued and solidified after their nature due to the drying of their members, it is impossible.
However, nature adjusts and covers over the cut bones of all parts, seemingly like glue that grows thicker as it adheres and strengthens within what has been conglutinated and linked, within which venom is present and fermentation, as if fire at its beginning, within which any cause does not prohibit that from being one of its works.
And for this reason, it is necessary to place cushions under the thighs, cushions in which gravity and viscosity and heaviness are found, as has been said.
You know that the types of fractures are different depending on the part of the body, and a fracture of the bone in the thigh is different from a fracture of the bone in the head; and a fracture of the bone in the chest is different from a fracture of the bone in the other shoulder; and seemingly all other parts are different from these.
When I remember all the cases of fracture, I will explain the distinct case of the capital one.
When there is a variety of fractures in the body, it is called a dislocation. When there are different types of bone fractures in the body, it is called a dislocation. There are arcuate fractures, fractures at the ends of bones, and some are fractures according to the length of the bone. Fractures of the shoulder and hip and dislocations can occur, as well as plagues and disruptions in the head, and small fissures.
And each species is engaged or tormented in the restoration of the body according to what was remembered in its distinctive locations.
Dislocation of bone fracture. And for this, the fracture of the bone is known: its twisting, and of that prominence, and its appearance to the sense, and so of it when you comprehend that with your own hand.
And when there is no twisting apparent in the location and it does not hurt, you do not have to touch the bone with your hand when it is agitated and the thigh does not suffer much pain, you do not have a fracture.
It is possible that there is a knot or a small fissure, but not necessarily that you can untie it with your hands alone, and no compression of the entire area; there may be some pause over the medicine of those that remember at the proper moment in that place, and perhaps a straight path for subtle stricture.
You know that when it is arched and does not split into two or another, without any accident in its swelling, as the whole part of its appearance remains, you can cover that there are some things that come from your time for correction of those that happen to apostema caut.
And if it happens to apostema caut, you should leave that for a few days until the apostema ceases; and after that, engulf that second hand that you can lift and disengage.
You know that the restoration of it and the washing of it is pushed by a slightly different one than the one that happened in the place where the swelling occurred.
And you should tighten that second hand that comes with the rememoration of it.
If in the bones there is swelling, you may need to extend this member cut into several parts, if it is the foot or the knee; or if the member is small, or if you use a cord and a string or one string and the hand.
When your position is at the place where you pause the member in its natural position, while the parts that are extended from the member are turned, you should pierce with a perforator that returns those addicts to their original shape and according to each manyer that can be found in their places.
And keep in mind that you should not harm the patient's thighs with your operation or injury; and pierce them according to the strongest power you can apply to one bone compared to the other, in better forms.
And at that time, profitably touch with your hand at the part you are working on, and if sometimes there is a different cause, adjust it and bring it to its right position according to the quantity of your virtue.
And equal extenssio and compression are needed, as wise physicians do when they make words seem foolish to patients by their operations, or make contraction in the member as they have seen by their operations of the words of their patients.
When it comes to the quality of the stricture of the quiet member, that which you recommend; because you know that these members are differentiated in their appearance and size and in the shape of those.
When those who are small as the arm and elbow say and seem to be like those, it is necessary to cover the envelope with a thin silk.
For those who have large thighs like the thigh or calf, it is necessary to cover the envelope with a hard and durable material, such as leather, which is connected to the big member and strengthens it in that part of the body, as if there were no gap.
And then, begin to empty your evacuation, place the cord conveniently according to that, over the location of that fracture am three or four times the member's size; and strengthen your hand with a small one on the cord.
And then, hold at that place at the end of the location of the fracture, and strengthen your hand with a small one on the part that does not stretch the member's stricture where you have strengthened the location of the fracture. And then, stretch the envelope of the location of the fracture a little, and soften the stricture little by little, until you take in one large part.
And take another needle and cover that other vein over the location where it should be enclosed, and see if the enclosures at the end of the fracture; and your operation will be in the stricture of the enclosure and in the mollification of that second one that they have said in the first enclosure.
And pause between the feathers of a lion's stop or a drap that is engulfed in the tortuosity of the fracture, if it has tortuosity; and if not, do not pause in it for any cause.
And pause over the other needle, and engulf around these enclosures that are faytantly falling, if in the location there is no inflammation or post-cautery apostema, and you pause over it that sede the apostema of that and that oste the inflammation; and layssa that per alcus jorns; and you strenh on them the stelhas.
And are the stelhas of the canna lada raza, and they should be formed in a savvy manner; or are of fust of pi; or of ramps of palm; and is the ample of each stelha according to this form and this figure:

You should know that it is not safe to cut all the limbs at once on the first day; the cause of this is that the limb is too large, and it does not heal quickly unless it is covered with something for about four days or seven or more days, according to your own experience with the onset of gangrene.
This is the type of plasters that the ancients used for mending broken bones and dislocations, and twists.
The type of plaster that is most suitable for the treatment of fractures, especially for the thighs and hips, where it should not be heated or wet: and that is made of powdered flour, and the marrow of the flour which you must use to move the bandage in the grooves of the flour.
And how it is done, but you should not use that for the thick album, and place the confection of it without pressure nor subtlety; and use that instead.
Another type of plaster for the treatment of fractures and dislocations: recipe of assafetida, of lavender, of acacia, of unguent, and migrach, which is made from milk salvage, of all parts of the drac. x; of honey and aloen of drac. v; alochil of drac. xx; all the thighs and hips, and cribellatz and mesclatz of water alichil or of album of huou if the composition of the plaster is scalfed; and use this plaster, which has a good composition and restores fractured bones gently, and confers comfort to men.
This appears to be a recipe for a poultice or ointment used for fractures and sprains. Here is the translation:
This text appears to be a medieval medical treatise discussing various medical procedures and treatments. Here's a line-by-line translation of the given source sentence:
When applying a plaster to joints and bones that have been separated from their original positions, and when there is pain or fissures and fractures: hold the linen bandage tightly and submerge it in warm water with oil, and place it over the area.
This product is not suitable for rejuvenation, but rather for the removal of scars and expulsion of painful sensations.
Another type of plaster that restores fractures: use fresh fig leaves and saffron leaves; mix them all together to make the plaster.
A plaster openly administered for the restoration of fractures of bones and when you want to resolve the inflammation of the plaster: take aloe, camomile flowers, and violet flowers, flour of ers, all parts except the tip and stem; all should be cut and tied with string, if the member is not scalded.
If it is not scalded, cut that part with fresh water from the humid colon of the patient or with clean water.
Another type of plaster that is quickly effective when the first one does not work for the removal of painful sensations caused by inflammation: take aloe, semen of li, and balsam, majorana, violet flowers, camomile flowers, all parts except the tip and stem; all should be cut and tied with string, if possible, with water from sauze or douse or cold water, depending on the quality of the member and the color of the skin.
May's Yopocras does not say that a cushion must be placed over the tense member for the restoration of the sinew, but rather wax and olive oil, and no other cause; and it advises that there should be a balance between magnitude and subtlety.
When Gualia was seen to have been pressed upon the member that had been cut off in the restoration and the causes of which were those that cause dryness in the body, which is similar to the heat of the fire, and resembles those causes that have been recommended.
Recipe for a plaster that soothes wounds and pain: use mortar made of lime, grounded marble or horse hair, and salt, divided into parts; it is pressed and baked and becomes plaster.
The more the quantity follows the quality that covers the wound and is divided, the better, because you consider if there is no pain, no excitement, or the limb is not cut, it is not suitable for its place, then you do not need to use too many pieces. And if you feel pain or excitement or inflammation at the location, then you should stop or remove that piece at the time, and take away the plaster from it.
And take some aloe vera and moistened seaweed, and submerge that in warm water, and let it wash the location where the excitement and pain cease; and after a while, lay down to rest the member for an hour; and then place something over the wet seaweed in cold oil or red oil, and leave it on until you are sure of not having aspirin, and that the inflammation of the member has subsided, and the pain has been relieved.
And then it is appropriate to apply that stricture subtly and thinly, and gently press on the part that is healthy, and subtly apply it so that it may be beneficial.
And if sometimes the affliction and weakness, pain and inflammation, and all other accidents have become common to all, and you are advised to apply ointment and stricture, then you should apply it as you have done at the beginning of the circumcision.
And if no accident occurs to the member from those that have been said, you should not remove it for less than three days or four or six; and some are completely healed in twenty days after your departure, as they have said, within which time the fracture adheres, and it settles down to the coagulation of the flesh over that.
And you should adjust the stricture to be less than that of your first stricture, and reduce the intake of food from the patient's thigh, according to which is preceded by the rememoration of it.
Then if you sometimes find the place of the fracture has dried and thinned more than it should, you will know that that nutrient is prohibited to reach that; and then embrocade that water with the saliva you have observed there, and let it be in total for three days; and then apply a small ointment to the stricture, and for this operation, give nourishment to the member, and it will heal.
When the fracture of another bone that was not properly restored at the beginning is not corrected by covering it, and then by tortuosity, it is an error in the operation of these, and there is great fear, and if it is not treated promptly, the ankles will become larger and more vulnerable, and they will be more likely to be affected.
I have not seen any of them do this, so it seems reasonable that this does not work.
Secondly, on fracture when it occurs in the head.
The species of fractures are blows, and their figures are different, and their causes are distinct. Four types of fractures are considered as direct compression of the skull, and the compression comes from the entire bone entering into the cranial cavity, which is then removed with forceps, just as in the case of a fracture at the fist, and for this reason this species is called dislocation; or the skull penetrates a part of the bone, and penetrates the flesh and does not pass through the penetration to the back of the bone; and this type of fracture is called complete dislocation.
When the plague of these fractures is great or small, and those that are contractional or tractional; and the cause of their pain is from burning or chafing on the skin, and to them it seems.
This fracture or penetrates that has already approached the periosteum that is now the bone; or it is in the face of the bone, and the plague of these fractures is great or small.
When a bone is broken, it is healed in the bones, in the subtlety of the small hair, and therefore this kind of broken bone is called capillary fracture.
This fracture is caused either by crushing or by blow to the bone and appears as if it enters any layer of the bone into parts of the digit, and it is caused in the concave part of the bone where the bones split when they are hit by the force and the part that enters is divided into parts of the digit.
This happens mainly in the bones of the human body, as if they were cups of eagles.
And all these kinds of fractures are thin as if they were separated stars. And you will find relief for all of this in its place.
And you can identify all these kinds of fractures by detection over those and by inquiry into their tendencies and the fatty tissue that is over them.
And the capillary fracture is identified by what is discovered on the bone, and it is removed, and it is limited to the tendency of the bone, where the fracture appears black.
When treating fractures, it is important to consider the patient's accidents in the lower body, and you should pay special attention to signs of manifest symptoms such as vomiting due to choler, extinction, loss of understanding, abscess of the vote, sincopi, acute fever, edema of the limbs, and symptoms similar to those in major departments, and the doctor's treatment may not be effective.
If you sometimes encounter accidents that are not related to current events, it is a sign of good health. If you wish to begin the cure of the patient,
The cause is known if it comes to you in the beginning of the disease as it is, and that is in the days of winter, as you study in the bone of the hip on the day of twelve seconds in a certain position.
If in the days of summer, you cover the wound with clean cloth on the seventh day, having known that the bone is now corrupted by the bandage, and that accidents may occur due to this.
If the fracture has already penetrated the bandage and covers the brain, and is divided into small and rough pieces, you should cover the damaged and torn parts with clean cloth, as recommended to you.
If it is that your race has plagued the thigh, and you discover over the bones according to custom and with your hand as possible according to the figure of the plague, and that it is less on the thigh.
If you suffer from bone fracture, loss of blood or appendicitis, you should apply the remedy as recommended to you, and if it is saturated with drapes infused in vinegar and oil, and fascia reduces the inflammation within a short time, and you are sure of the loss of blood; and then start in the circuition of the bone and in the ablation of it.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And the second maneuver is that you insert the needle into the bone as straight as possible, and this is the form of it: And then administer another needle into this, a small push point that is; and this is the form of it:
And then apply the appropriate amount of scissors that was previously measured.
And if you have several types of scissors, each with its own blade, and the others are shorter but sharper than the rest, and they are made of iron or steel; then use them according to their length and sharpness.
And use them easily by striking on the scissors with your finger, without cutting the head and causing damage to the blade.
And if the bones are hard and strong, then use them by drilling through the circuit of the joint you are administering the scissors to, the ones that are called non-penetrating tarsals.
And do not call them anything other than those that do not puncture the end of the bone as much as possible, for those that are on the tarsal, make the edge or margin round or like a small circle, which prohibits being submerged and passing through the spindle of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a great number of these tarsals, which are suitable for the spindle of each bone, as long as the end of the bone is sharp, the quantity in length and breadth is second to the quantity of spindle of this test.
This is the form of three kinds of thermal travel: The quality of piercing in the circuit of the cut bone is that you place the thermometer on the bone and rotate it according to the time you know that the bone has been penetrated; and appropriately move the thermometer to another location, and pause there until it covers the entire amount of the size of the ray or environs.
And appropriately insert the scissors there that is between every part of the bone, and make it subtle that you can over it to prevent levitation, as they have said, when you radiate the bone, or if your hand, or if another cause for some sturments which will appear at that place, as tweezers and fine forceps.
And be careful that the scissors do not touch any cause of the cipher.
And when the bone is perforated and separated from the cipher if continued to it, and you extract it, be careful that the rays and turns of that are in the sharpness of the bone that is in the cipher are not similar to scissors, but rather be careful that it is subtle and the other scissors.
If you come across any small fragment of bone or cartilage, take hold of it with ease and as necessary from the sturments; and then treat the wound with care and find out which ones have been injured.
The other hand of the operation is longer, about a foot, which Gualia made and laughed greatly; and this is the saying: it is necessary for you at the beginning that you discover the fragment of bone in the place where the fracture is very strong and very manifest, when you will have discovered that part and will hold the end of this slow and glad inscissori of which this is the form:
E is that the lenticular fragment is like a lion and does not cause any cause, and the acute fragment is in two layers ahead in length, as many times; that the lenticular fragment should be adjusted to the cipher at the face of the acute one on the bone.
E if you cut over the incision of a piece with a small mallet when all the bones are inscribed, and you are sure that the pandect is not involved in the accident you fear in this hand, and if the physician14 was the fool of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he was sleeping.
If any cause annexes to the bone of the patella in certain places of bones, it will be located at that part of the incisive lenticular, and will be delivered at that part of the incisive nodules and paors.
If the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the patella, and if that which is separated or remains in the bone is the face of it, and there are sharp and subtle roughnesses on it, then you should cover those roughnesses and serrate those subtle roughnesses with rasps of various quantities so that you can possibly administer those to all locations with convenient push-pus and the push-pus of the next according to where you lose your operation of that cut bone and its figure.
And cover that you administer in your ratio with the one that rasps the bone at the beginning with the subtle push-pus of it, and use the subtle push-pus of it, and do not stop giving it continuously as you pass to administer the push-pus of all those.
When in any of the other small fractures or subtle breaks, follow the care you used for this one to correct the position.
And it is because none of them were anesthetized over all those who studied in that art. And so we have written about this in great fractures.
And if the splint is tightened when you reduce the bone, you should take as much cloth as there is of the swelling, submerge it in warm olive oil, and place it over the orifice of the swelling; and take another folded or tripled piece of cloth and submerge it in warm olive oil and place it over the original cloth and apply pressure on that as you can, without squeezing the limb too much. And administer to that bandage, and do not strain it only by quantity, but by the amount of swelling.
And apply this remedy for one or two days after you are sure there is no apoplexy; and then remove it and administer medicines as needed from those that are superfluous, such as linen and flour of errors, powder of ensels and of aristotle's baths, and similar substances for those.
It is necessary that you make these powders of this medicine finely ground and dry them over the plague; and generally, they are administered in this entire medicine of which it is free from poison and does not cause harm.
And keep in mind that the plague in your cure is not net; and it should not be in its surdity of engaging or another; nor should virulence be added to it; for when it is adjusted over the panniculus of the brain, it corrupts that and dries it up there, and it accides upon the thighs accordingly with that malicious malignancy.
And it happens in the forehead of the head, as the bone of the skull is sharpened when the cure for the head is applied and becomes blackened in its surface; and therefore consider that if it happens on the thigh accidents that have been told, you will know that it is all true.
And if it does not become blackened but from the medicine that has been placed under it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine that it becomes blackened, you should know that you take one part of honey and three parts of red olive oil, and apply those lines over the forehead, and place that over the forehead; and then cure that with the specials of the cure that are suitable for when it is healthy.
I apologize, but I am unable to translate the source sentence
This line can be translated as: "Of the restoration of the nose when it is cut." In the context of medieval medical treat
This line can be translated as: "You know that the nose is not cut, but rather made up of several pieces, or one of those some bones, which has two ossicles, where the part you have is cartilaginous, and is not cut, nor does it happen to it, but rather has atricio, tortuosity, and sinuitation." In other words, the nose is not a single piece, but rather made up of several parts, including cartilage and bone. The author is likely explaining that the nose should not be cut or severed, as this would cause damage to these delicate structures.
This line can be translated as: "If one of the pieces of the nose is cut, you should know that you must introduce the little piece into the nose, and close the fracture with the tip of the instrument, and with the point opposite it, so that it returns to its natural figure." In other words, if a piece of the nose is cut, the surgeon should be able to reinsert it into the nose and close the fracture with the tip of the instrument and a point opposite it. This will help to restore the nose to its natural shape. This line can be translated as: "And it is necessary for you to facilitate this by your hand, and remember that you do not close for your own operation on the thighs of the patient." In other words, the surgeon should be careful not to close the incision during the operation on the patient's thighs. This could potentially cause complications or injury to
If the fracture is in the upper lip part of the nose, and it does not penetrate to that point, then you should cover it with something equal to the end of the ray in which there is a small growth.
If the fracture is in multiple parts, you should make the appearance of this.
And in the first day of the fracture, if possible, make restoration of it; and otherwise, take about the sixth part of the cauterized area for the repair of the apostema.
And if you enter at the end of the nose a meca of drap with li, if the fracture is in one part, or metz doas calguas, if the fracture is in multiple parts, and it is in the gross calgua as much quantity as possible to fill the nar of the nas.
And I advise the ancient restorers that the calguas are wrapped in border, and they are moved every day, not seen by me; having known that the meca is wrapped in album of huou comfit as powder of moli; and layssa the qualgua inside when the os is firm and endurazita the cartillage.
And some veguadas are inside the nose, in place of calgua, pain of auca pus that is enveloped with drap of li leon; and it is that you have the fracture of the nas pus vehement and that the malaute not is prohibit of inspiration.
This cause is not necessary for you; and if you wish, make it, and if you wish, make incisions.
If another wound occurs after cauterization, apply the plaster to the nose or cheek where it is most sensitive, or apply a damp cloth.
If no wound occurs after cauterization, you should cover that part with flour and powdered essence of ensel, and place your hand on the leopard's stop, and do not touch the nose for any cause.
If you break or fracture a few bones in the nose, you should cover them with cloth and remove those instruments that are appropriate for them; then close the wound, and cure it with what is appropriate for it, whether it is cornea or consolidation, and apply plasters as needed.
If a boil occurs on the nose, you should cure it with what is appropriate for it and administer intravenous solutions of plasma as needed to make it completely healthy.
Capitol. This is likely a heading or title, not a sentence to
Restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the jaw is broken and the fracture is not a boil, observe whether the fracture is deformed only, and not torn in two, and is curved in parts of the teeth, then your diagnosis should be lighter.
When the fracture is in the front part of the limb, you should introduce the left indicus into the mouth of the patient; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the mandible, you should introduce the right indicus into the mouth of the patient; and press gently on that to facilitate the reduction of the fracture, on the other side of the fragment of the bone, on the patient's own bone of the opposite side of the fracture, in the same manner.
If the mandible fracture is already separated into halves, you should cover that you are administering extension of parts on either side, according to the right line, as soon as it is possible to achieve equilibrium.
If you happen to have a concussion of the teeth at disruption, you should tightly hold those that seem to be the most important, such as gold or silver or lead; and place your hand on the broken mandible, and on the double drape, and on the large cushion gently, or a piece of sole of your shoe according to the length of the mandible, and then apply it in the same way that you have adjusted the splint and that seems to be most suitable, as soon as it is not destroyed.
When ordering the patient to use rest and tranquility, and to stop eating the foods that cause stomach upset.
If you think that the figure has changed in any way, then you should cut and remove it on that day; and then correct what has been altered and add powder of milk, album of honey, or flour of cinnamon, which you would have placed on the wound, and place over the plaster leopard skin.
And then when this plaster is anchored and adjusted on the bone, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, which will not come off until the patient is healed and the fracture is strong; four weeks later, this fracture will be straightened.
If another accident of gout occurs, then you should administer the medication that has been prescribed for the four weeks that the patient is healed, and keep that gout under control.
If the fracture is infected, you should consider if it is due to the bone being separated or split, and then you should subtly remove those sutures that are appropriate for this wound in the removal of those from the stitches.
If the wound of the plague is straight, then you should enlarge it according to the quantity of your need by cutting it with a knife.
When you have finished stitching those wounds and if there is no remaining infection, then you can perform the amputation if it is necessary; otherwise, place a bandage over that one of the dressings that suits best and covers it when it is healed.
Capitol v. is not a complete sentence, but I can
De restauracio de la furcula quan es trinquada translates to "Of the restoration of the shoulder when it is fractured." This suggests
Motas veguadas es trencada la furcula de la partida denant deves le muscle, and that fracture is made in one of the three directions. This means that if the shoulder bone is fractured, it should be treated by aligning it in one of the three possible positions (anterior, posterior, or lateral) to ensure proper healing.
Quar o es trencada, o seperada, or es separada en doas partz otra que no accidan satagias; e es leugier a la restauracio de lu; o es ayssi que accideysso en lu satagias, e es dificil a restauracio de lu; o es ayssi que la fractura es am plagua. This sentence is quite complex and can be translated as: "Either it is broken, separated, or it is separated into two parts that do not have suture wounds; and it is easier to restore the restoration of the shoulder; or it is possible that the fracture occurred in those wounds, and it is difficult to restore the restoration of the shoulder; or it is possible that the fracture is
In the operation in that case, when the fracture is found to be displaced, it is necessary for you to have two assistants, so that one holds the assistant and follows the furcula trenched, and the other extends the collar ves to that part.
And if the fracture is found to be in the direction of the second form as described, and it is not in its eminence nor concavity, then...
And if you wish for extension, it is necessary that you place your hand over the thigh bone, whether it is of wool or linen, and according to the size of your need, extend and raise the furcula and cut the spere at your own discretion, following the fracture in the direction that was described.
And if you are unable to pull the end of the furcula to the desired parts, then it is necessary that you place your hand over the thigh bone, so that it is straightened over the hip, and hold it over the muscle of the leg with a cushion larger in size.
The minister presses the muscle of the patient on the parts that have entered until the bone of the clavicle is raised as in the preon, and you correct the fracture and reduce it to those that say.
If you feel pain in the clavicle and stiffness, then cover that part with something and take out those stiffnesses for ease.
And if it is held in the bone, you must insert an incision of the patient with one of the incisors that you have seen on this, because you had paused earlier the clavicle the sturment that serves the cipher; and the sturment is made of flint or iron of which this is the form of it:
It seems like the cut is of the kind of cook; and it is the latitude of that which you need for it, according to the size of the bone or the thickness of it.
The length of it should be according to what you can reach in the operation; that there are ends aways and one end is wide and the other is narrow.
If the disruption of the plague that you inscribed when you extracted the joint from the bone is wide, and it is certain to cause an abscess, then you should adjust the corners of the plague with sutures.
If the disruption is small, or you fear an abscess, then you should cover the plague with strips and powders according to the size of the plague's cut.
If an abscess occurs, then inform the patient that you will apply a dressing of ointment and oil, and stop there.
E tot, that no harm be made to the pelvis bone; and for this reason, that every day you see the womb, when the ligament is softened or you have already made the pelvis bone harmed, then you rectify this and strengthen the labia.
And then pause the fall of the patient over the chest, and pause further the pillow of the head so that they can sleep on their side in the bed with a small cushion; so that the helper of the patient's shoulder is elevated from the shoulder of that one, and thus the fracture of the acromion is raised to the muscle; or if the arms of the patient are by the collar of that one.
And do not unwind the bandage if it does not occur in the right place or abscess, enter within twelve days.
And if you have seen the face of the patient's head, and adjust in the closure and restore that and let enter when it is restored and the fracture of the acromion is coagulated.
And it becomes stronger and more comfortable every month for twenty-eight days, and some are made in the time of that man.
Capitol, Chapter Six.
On the restoration of the shoulder fracture.
The spatula is cut on the side of the shoulder and not cut except for the margins.
When the location of the bone is cut — and it is cut in the middle of the bone — and it is not known unless touched, then you should follow that the figure of the fractured bone shows you the preparation for the bone and reduce that figure to its natural position in the entire curve of the curve that is as possible for you.
Then place on the powder of finely ground almond and lemon; and then place a powder of double-dyed cloth; and then place on the flat side of the subtle table according to the quantity of the spatula, either a little or less.
If the table is now concave in the corners of the spatula's points, then you should cut that concave with lemon, and it may be equal to the table.
Then stretch the wet long part under the constraint of the table and enter it between the fixed parts so that it is not tightened to the place.
And consider the limb in every day; and all seen that it is softened, another seen and stretch it and hold the stela equal to the table if it is tightened to the place.
When the patient's leg is placed on the table, it means "When the patient's leg is placed on the table.
The spoon is restored in xx days or in .xxv.
When this number is completed, you dissolve the ligament, and you know certainly that it comes from the bones of which the beginning is not doubted nor their dissolution.
If you proceed to the location of the knee and wipe away the dressing, then cut over it and remove it, and then follow what has been said in the fracture of the femoral head of the hip joint if it happens here.
Chapter VII.
On the restoration of the hip joint fracture.
The hip joint some bones are broken in their place and then they are scattered; but the ends of the bones that are not chipped are still intact.
And when the hip joint is broken, it often happens that the fragments are inclined towards the parts of the dentary and cause great pain, difficulty in locomotion, coughing, vomiting, and intense fever; and it is declared in the cavity of the broken bone and not hidden from sensation.
And the restoration of the hip joint is that it is placed on its side over the opposite thigh, and a cushion is placed between the spots of the bone; and the muscles are pressed, and the ribs are adjusted to the most comfortable position for both ribs, and it is handled subtly in the operation and afterward in the movement that can be possible and convenient, until the figure of the bone returns to its former shape.
And then place your hand over the plaster and stop and rest on the table of fine sauce or of a brush and of those that resemble it in lightness, so that you wrap around that in cloth; and then finely place your hand on the cut bone that is not rough; and apply pressure along the back of some veins, and tighten that restriction evenly; and then consider the plaster throughout, and when it becomes soft, tighten that.
If necessary, cause the affected part of that corrosive or prickling, pain, or gout to occur in that place, then cut and remove that and remove the plaster and rectify what happens according to your medical care for the hand; and reduce the plaster if it sometimes affects the face; and adjust the stricture within what is healthy.
Chapter 8.
Of the restoration of the ribs when they are twisted.
You know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in large locations where the two sides meet, and from the ends of which nothing happens to those contractions unless it is due to those cartilaginous ones. I know that the patient is not anxious about the feeling of the inquisition of the doctor's hands.
When the restoration is done as follows: the fracture is closed with the thumb of the left hand, entering it from the side that is broken, and pressing and tightening the cut bone with the thumb of the right hand, if directed by the doctor.
If the rib fracture is inclined towards the division of the ribs, you will experience severe pain in the back and puncture, as if puncturing that which has bled, and for this reason the bones are placed in a gauze; and there will be difficulty in healing, coughing, and vomiting of sputum; and this is difficult to cure.
The first line of the text translates to: "Indeed, the Antixs were engineers in that particular art.
When it comes to the matter at hand: cover the patient's thighs with pillows to prevent inflammation and swelling, so that the abdomen is flat and extended, and the fracture is pushed towards the proper positions.
We should know this for the purpose of not causing unnecessary cauterization, if possible; and if it happens, help with that.
They should be told to close the wound as soon as possible and as tightly as possible; and it seems like reasoning, but it is feared that the wind may drive the superfluous air to the location due to weakness.
They should be told to cover the wound with lint that has been soaked in ointment, and place it between the ribs, ensuring that the incision is closed when filled, which is the lip that closes when the second part is pulled back; and apply it to the patient's abdomen for the treatment of gastric pain and medicine.
And if the abdomen is severely constrained and does not suffer, and the doctor punctures the membrane with the needle, be afraid of the abdomen, and cover the wound with something over the location, discover the torn costa, and then remove that instrument that preserves the cipher, the memory of which is preceded, and that inserts the bones easily, and extracts it.
When it comes to adjusting the mouth of the pus, if it is large, apply heat, and cover it with a plaster once it has healed.
If you have a wound from poison ivy, then cut the cloth and put powder on it with red olive oil, and place it over the area to cure the wound that is causing the poison ivy.
If you are sleeping on the bed where the disease resides, then go inside and it will be cured.
Chapter 9.
Of the restoration of a spinal fracture of the two and the neck.
Some people have fractures of the bones of the neck, and they are affected by the same spinal column as the back. And when you want to know if it is cured or not, consider that sometimes the wounds are less hard and stupefied, and dead, and cannot be made up, extended, or stretched, and when you tie them with strings or punches, and do not feel any pain in them, you know that it is not cured, and in the months of dispositions it is mortal.
If those painful and sharp points are made on those constrained parts, you should know that the nucha of the bone is preserved and that the leg rarely suffers from infection.
If you see the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if it is healthy or not, consider the feet of the patient.
If you see that the patient has become soft, look at those who are affected in the same way and when you touch the abdomen, you feel ventilation and defecation of his will, and some women have their genitals covered over the abdomen and cannot urinate, then you know that it is mortal and should not be cured in the patient's care.
If you do not find any cause for those, the cause is better and leaves more room.
The cure of the patient is that you perforate at the seat of the apoplexy caudex that you place over the vertebra that is red or pink, or as you wish; place over that some women's eyes and a few days later, some women's eyes see that the apoplexy caudex is sedated.
And you stop one of the plasters that are comforting and existent, and stretch over that with your hand; and command the patient to use rest and tranquility and not sleep on the part where the pain is before it becomes healthy again.
If something happens to the hip bone or any other cause that is already separated from the body, you should cover it with a cloth over the abdomen and keep those bones; and if possible, adjust the lips of the wound, using stitches if it is large; and if necessary, care for that area with an antiseptic solution, entering if it is sane.
If the hip bone is cut, and the end of the thigh is exposed, you should cover the left hand of the opposite leg in the anus, and tie the cut bone with the other hand as possible; and place your thumb on the plaster and bandage, if directed by those, and tighten it.
And if you feel that the hip bone is cut, you should apply a bandage on that area, remove it, and care for the wound as part of the previous treatment, entering if it is healthy.
Capitol. This is likely a reference to a specific chapter or
De restauracio de la ancha. This line translates to "Of the restoration of
The bones of the thighs are often broken, and if they break, their fracture is not only a communication at the extremities but are inserted in the longitudinal axis and decline to the parts of the dentition; and things happen to the pain in the body and puncture, and the camba is stupefied when the fracture occurs.
The restoration of the joint is that you extend your hand over that which is above the fracture, as shown in the figure of the hand.
If the fracture is at the end of the limb, simply, you should cut along that second line which appears to you as equal by equality within which it is similar to its natural figure.
If the fracture is at the end of the leg, which has already declined into the parts on the side, you should place the table over the patient's stomach within which it is prepared for you to restore that fracture. And when you have cut along that line, place your hand on the plaster, and place your hand on that frame of paste or nail, and press firmly over it, fearing neither puncture of the fracture nor movement of the staple.
And cut along that second line which is equal to the one you are pulling out, and order the table to lie over the stomach or to expose the side opposite it.
If you have an attack of gout, stop extending the limb and its restoration until the attack of gout is sedated, and place your hand on that second line which follows that one which precedes it; and return to the restoration of the limb and press that arm as hard as possible.
If you happen to injure or break your bones, you should treat them.
1. The text is a medieval medical treatise written in
1. De restauracio de la fractura del adjutori. translates to "Of the restoration of the fracture of
1. Adjutori is what is between the thigh and the neck of the shoulder.
1. And if it is cut, you should restore the restoration of the bone in one of the two hands, of which the one that you hold is the one that is most suitable for this form:
1. They are tied in two ends of the cord, and then they are hung up from the raised place.
1. And follow the patient on a bed; and then let go of the hand that is cut over the end that comes to the top of the shoulder in the place where the curve of the thumb is attached.
1. And then hang over that cause, or the master extends it to the parts outside; and then the surgeon and the fracture should be treated as much as possible, within which the fracture returns according to its cover.
The other hand is that the thigh be placed over the cervical spine and suspend the arm of the collar of the limb; and accordingly command two ministers who one of them holds that it is out of order with the fracture of his bones; and the other holds the pus further from him; and then extend this to their parting.
If you want the extension to be strong puddle, then hold on the fracture of the bone and on the other bone, and then the two ministers extend to their parts.
And if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then hold that the pus is placed over the tendon and the other further from the fracture, please take the coil.
And if the fracture is near the coil, then hold that the pus is placed over that place and over that tendon.
Uncover that ease and work on it, and according to how much is uncovered when it is covered and applied in good application, hold that ease and if it does not cause strangulation of the cauterization, then strengthen it.
If you have an attack of cholera, relax the stricture on the seventh day, and place your hand over the wet and red part that has stopped the attack, and continue to hold it.
The hand that holds it is what you apply plaster to over the fracture, and place an envelope of cloth around it; and adjust your arm over that assistant, and place your hand over the surgical wound.
And place the cloth and hold on the assistant's arm with your hand so that the arm is in its proper position, if not prohibited by any cause of the broken bone.
And use splints.
And place the splint over the fracture that is pressed and fortified with other splints; and leave a space between each splint of one-third of the total length, and the length of the splints according to the break.
And hold on the splints over the stricture that I mentioned at the beginning of the treatise.
And your stricture over the location of the fracture is pressed tightly. When the fracture is slightly open, it is called a "stricture.
If you sometimes notice that the situation of the pins and the stricture is as they said when you restore the member to its original position, then you must do this.
If you fear an asthma attack, then you should loosen the stricture and the pins as they said.
And after three days, consider the liament in all parts to prevent inflammation or swelling from occurring at the site; or it is forbidden for food to reach the member due to the excessive stricture; and then rectify everything according to what they have said.
If you are concerned about not causing any cause for this, do not dismiss the ligament unless after three days or more.
And is the patient's lying on the side of the abdomen over the right shoulder, and the shoulders are more on the stomach.
And place your hand on the full stomach of the lamb, and consider in the whole hour of the night or day that the figure of the cut member is not faded or dissolved, or that the ligament is softened, then rectify everything according to your virtue.
And pause the diet of the patient according to the order that has been given, in such a way that the diet is gradual at the beginning, and increases as it progresses; and you cover that you add more food to the diet.
Four common symptoms of the assistant and the patient's constitution are that they become stronger in 40 days; and you cover that they become weaker and are administered food and medicine, and are cured by those who correct them.
And if the fracture is already open, you do not close it with that ligament and staples within a few days or within two months.
Chapter XII.
Of the restoration of a broken arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called the ulna; of which one is small and that which is pointed, and the other is large and that which is left from the pointed one.
And very often it is cut the larger bone, or the smaller one, and very often they are triturated.
When the small focus is cut, you restore the skin of the area, and the surgery is pushed back a little.
When the focus of the bone is cut, the fracture of the bone is bad, and the surgery is difficult.
And it is bad when those bones are cut.
Therefore, if the bone that is cut is small, it is convenient for the surgeon to be present, and you should restore the skin, making it a little longer for ease of insertion, as it may be torn.
If the bone is large, it is best that you make the cut longer, and push the skin further with great force.
If both bones are cut, you should make sure to pull out the extraction as hard as possible.
And you should make sure to restore the figure of the face, and extend the extensive skin over a cushion, and place the parts of the face in their positions, and say that all other words are as follows, and the mouth is placed below the other words, and the throat is on a pillow.
If a cushion is placed under the patient's thighs or chest, so that the hernia does not protrude.
Then the minister extends the arms of the patient's side, either to the side or to the front, and another minister extends them in a similar manner.
Then the surgeon cuts the bones that enter the second better figure that can be.
If in the bone's structure there are sags, then you have to drill a hole through the entire thigh in the correct location for your virtue.
If there appears in the separated sack that punctures the noose and is not what you expect for the restoration of the thigh, then you have to do something about it and leave that one behind the other hand that they have told you.
If the fracture is not in a good place, and I have already done this for another similar case, then take the care of that one.
If you have an apothecary attack at the beginning of your restoration, then you must line a cloth with a certain amount of olive oil and white wax, and it should be more precise and subtle, and press the cloth over that subtle opening when the apothecary is ceding; and then remove the cloth and stop applying the prepared powder from the clay of the hooves, and stop stapling; and that staple is the one you should leave on the fractured part that has been made large and strong.
You know that the number of the shoulder bones in the larger positions is not in a single fracture or in two fractures.
Then stop the tightening over the location of the fracture with great and violent force, and when less extirction is made from the parts of the fracture or from the lower parts of the limb, stop the tightening a little sooner than the rememoration of the head of the caput.
The cloths that envelop the fracture are soft and not hard or abrasive, and it is the one that is most suitable between subtle and large, as they have recommended.
Consider the member and its limb for a short time. If you meet any cause for which rectification is necessary, act as soon as possible, and cover the member with wet cloth until that excitement ceases.
See that the member does not contract within which it pauses, and then return the tightening.
If the extriction has already been softened and the bone has been reshaped to resemble those, then you should correct everything with your own virtue.
When considering whether the nourishment is prohibited from reaching the member due to excessive stricture, it is customary to use a poultice that softens that part a little each day until it runs into that member, and then firm it up.
If the joint does not happen to be caused by any of those that have been said, then you should not think that it will take more than twenty days or around those to be healed.
And if you hang the joint of the knee up by its own movement of movement, and make it sleep on the right side.
You know that this fracture is restored in xxx days or in xxxii days, or rather in xxviii days, and then it is followed by the position of the complexes and the positions of the virtue.
Chapter 13.
Of the restoration of fracture of the thigh bone and of the toes.
You know that in the thigh bone and in the toes of the foot there is fracture, and it does not happen to them but by violent movements seen.
And when fracture or dislocation happens to the thigh bone, you should know that it follows the knee in its fall and that the leg is seen second in equality, and you should stop the joint of the knee on that extended one.
The minister extends the broken bones and the surgeon pushes them back into their proper position, as good as they can be repositioned.
And if you do not stop the bleeding with a plaster or bandage, it may happen to have an abscess; and then stop pressing on that part according to the amount of the wound, and you have already wrapped it in a cloth.
If the splint is in the joints of the fingers, and you make it look like a glove made of cloth, and command the patient to hold their hand with the splinted finger against their palm; then make sure the cloth is long enough.
And if the cloth is held on the hand with the splinted finger against the palm, and the thumb is applied to the cloth; then hold it tightly.
If the fracture is at the joints of the fingers, you should stop pressing on the cloth and another part of the same joint in the palm, so that the hand can be bent and turned; and then release the pressure, as it is wrapped around the nail between the fingers.
If a fracture occurs in any of the toes of the foot, if it is necessary to cut through it, make sure it is narrow and fasten it with a thread at the base of the toe and around the nail, then stop and leave a small piece of thread on the side that is raised and not sore.
If the fracture is in any other toe, follow the same procedure as in that particular location, or in the index finger, ear, or anus, and if all goes well, it is better; or stop over that small piece of thread, as they have said in the knot.
And consider, in your restoration, and as you have already done, the disposition of the cauterization and opposition — as in the previous operation — I believe that it covers when any cause occurs of those, according to the narrative of the one.
Capitulum XIV.
Chapter XIV on the restoration of a bone fracture of the thigh.
The bones of the thigh are cut open and declared to the senses according to what converts them to the parting point and the swollen pubic bone.
The restoration of the body is made in such a way that one limb is placed over the fracture and another limb further along the fracture, and the patient lies on their stomach with their face down.
The surgeon extends the entire limb to its full length according to the quality of the bone in the location of the fracture.
If the joint is close to the neck, then the limb should be placed directly against the point of the hip, so that the extension affects it, and the other limb continues the fracture.
If the fracture is close to the neck, then the limb should be placed directly against the point of the shoulder, so that the extension affects it, and the other limb continues the fracture.
The surgeon aligns the bones as much as possible within the joint, reducing it according to the similarity with the natural position and the bone is conjoined by good conjuncture; you cover the joint with plaster and stricture, unless it happens to the member itself. If it happens in the joint, then you must remove that for a certain number of days until the swelling disappears and return to your care.
The stricture of the patient's pain is that it covers over the fracture with a hard wire, bends it into two or three folds, and remains in place; and it envelops the socket within which the toe enters and the end of the toe.
Then insert a long pin between the thigh and the socket of the joint, and bring the ends of the pin through the corresponding openings of the parts on either side, and wrap them around the socket and thigh as much as possible over the hard wire.
Then place your hand over the thigh at the location of that broken bone, and place one stone on the bones of the socket.
Then fill the spaces between the socket and the calf with cloths, so that the stricture is coagulated.
Then begin to make a strong bandage over the location of the fracture with three or four folds, and as few as possible, your bandage will be stronger and hold better.
Then extend the ends of the pin to the corresponding parts on either side, and tightly pull the ends of the stones of the other part so that the bandage does not come loose from the desired location.
When you apply the structure over that part, it is understood that it will not affect the corroding or gouty joints nor cause inflammation or swelling; and if it affects any of those causes, then cut off this part from him, and correct all that happens, according to what has been said by the wise.
If the knee is painful in the knee, you should know that this is possible for you; otherwise, cover that part with something and rest it, and cure that which follows the remembrance when it is healthy.
And some wise men advise that this fracture of the thigh be treated with another method that is adjusted to the patient's condition, as has been said in the adjuvant and in the arm.
However, in the restoration of the patient with that method, it does not cause claudication in the thigh; and if it is restored alone, or another cushion is applied to the other part, you should know that this one must be claudicated from the one that is hottest.
You should know that the thigh is tightened for fourteen days or a few months or a few months, and this is entirely due to the diversity of the complexions and other compositions.
Chapter XV.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the collarbone of the neck.
You know that a fracture of the collarbone of the neck is usually caused by a sudden blow to the head or shoulder.
If the fracture is not caused by a sudden blow to the head or shoulder, it is usually a crack or split in the bones, and this causes pain or discomfort, and everything is affected by this sensation.
And the restoration of the collarbone is usually done in such a way that it is held together as much as possible, being reinforced and adjusted according to what is possible for equilibrium and ease and convenience and production.
And apply plaster and place it over that round surface, if you need to; and tighten it as much as possible according to the strength of the material.
And consider all the positions that have been recommended for other fractures, and see how to apply caution and similarity to those that opposed this accident in order to be healthy and safe within what is possible for this collarbone.

And then, apply extension, equilibrium, and relaxation of the muscles according to that joint.
However, if the fracture of the thigh is not caused by strong movements, then extension should be more gentle and lighter, and it will be easier for you to bear.
And if there is any cause of operation over the arm, and it happens when you pull out the sticks and that takes a long time to complete the operation, then you should take hammerheads of iron that are placed under the causes that are placed in place, and those that are thin, and not hard on the hands, and be as long as those that are long as the thigh, and from the middle of the hand to the end.
And then, cover it over with any cloth according to its length, and place one on the beginning of the thigh of one part and the other part of the other part, and they are inserted into the pus of the foot's bottom.
And if you have the cloths on three parts of the thigh and at the middle, then this restriction of the thigh is not allowed clinically to the right and left side, and it is good for the posture.
When the long end of the cushion has been administered; and it is placed on the chest to preserve that from movement.
And above all, make sure you do this in a fracture, and when it is truly necessary.
And consider the chest in every day and study it thoroughly, and you will guard against apoplexy and inflammation or other similar causes; and when any of those causes happen, stop what you are doing and attend to this as soon as possible that it may be cured.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and toes.
Not all ankle fractures occur; fewer foot bone fractures occur, and toes fractures rarely occur, and only occur due to trauma in the months of disposition.
And if the feet bones are fractured and those bones are sometimes elevated over them between them, you must place the patient's foot on the ground prepared as before.
And a similar pause the foot on that which is raised from those bones, and similarly heat those bones, and press them, and pull them back in when they turn in the sockets.
And a similar plaster and bandage, and pause here the belly of the foot on a small table with two pieces of plastic.
And similarly stretch that to the foot, push that with drapes and other causes of which you have indicated.
And when those three days or four have passed, you will loosen the ligament, and then you will find the bones engaged, or they are dislocated, and the operation on them will be successful with screws.
And if they are dislocated, you will restore them, and pull them back in as I have told you to do in the restoration of those that you have mentioned. And a similar restoration of the dislocated bone is made along the length of the bone, and a small piece is placed under it; and then the foot is placed on this table that I have recommended to you, and you stretch that to the ligament.
When a joint is compressed by two or three or more bones, you should place your hand over each point of compression and wrap it with a cloth, then pull the table up to the base of the foot and hold it steady over one of the corners of the table for the abdomen of the foot to ensure good retention.
It is convenient for you to not overlook that you do not consider all causes which have been said to you in other fractures of the accidents that have been told to you; and pause here with all accidents that come to you.
Chapter XVIII.
Of the fracture of the humerus of the arm, the femur bone of the thigh, and the knee of the leg.
When the humerus of the arm is compressed, you make that cut in that direction, and then lean it towards the end of the two, and hold it behind.
And if the midwife does not cut the shoulder, and makes it as the shoulder should be; and if the thigh is broken, then raise the two sides of the little one a little by little, until all of this is outside, and return the humerus to its place as it should be and the shoulder returns.
And then place powders on the back of the patient, and when you want to urinate, make the path easy and easy, and reduce and return that second pillow to the first one that was placed at the beginning, and return the first powder.
And fast for seven days or until you are recovered, then you will be restored.
And if you want, take once a day a piece of linen and press over the abdomen of the patient a canula of wax; and enter the whole vesicle into the cavity of the patient, and sprinkle it through the canula as much as possible while the vesicle is inflated due to the cavity, so that the fracture returns.
And then cover it with feces and stay for several days after that have been recommended, until you are cured.
And when the teeth of the penis or vagina are broken, administer in the restoration and injection of water that has been recommended in the bone of the ankle.
And water that is not hidden in these proximal fractures and that does not come out much, mainly to the one who studies and uses this free word; then that fracture means to you in the largest possible ways in restoration and stricture of the penis, and therefore understand.
When the woman's hair is caught in something, take a knife from anywhere, and put the hair in that; and place a cloth over it within the drapery envelope, and keep it covered for three days or until the swelling subsides, and it will be healed.
Capitol .xix. is not a complete sentence and does not provide
Of the restoration of bone fractures when they are broken.
It is convenient for the one who sustains a fracture, and especially if the bones are large, such as the thigh or shin bone, or seem to be, that you should apply the reduction as quickly as possible, according to the conditions of flebotomy at your disposal or as witnesses testify.
And if the fracture is open, you should know that you must apply the reduction to the part of the bone that you have powdered on the side opposite to the one that is broken, if there is no other cause for your delay.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that day, and do not prolong it if you do not have a relapse.
If you happen to have an abscess, then you should restore the restoration of the affected area within nine days, once the abscess has healed, and do not approach it again for three days after that, as you will be performing other unfortunate accidents.
If the bone is protruding over the discovery of the wound, then cover that and reduce it to the extent possible and as quickly as possible with your own hands.
If the extension is not prepared and the force of the wound is on your shoulders, then reduce that to the extent possible with your own hands; and this instrument is made of iron, its length is seven inches or eight, and its width is according to the quantity of plague; and therefore it is necessary for the surgeon to grasp those three or four according to the quantity you indicate in the cure throughout the species of fracture.
And it is good, and there should be little grease for you that is not bent in the compression over that at the time of the operation.
When it comes to sharp extremity, which is located at the end of the limbs; and when the doctor's hand is large and enters the parts inside.
This is the form of him.
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", which is a small palette.
Because when the extremity of him is lowered, it comes up high on the end of the prominent bone.
And he presses it in a way that returns the bone, and it is held fast by some equilibrium.
And he tries to hold the extremities of the fracture together, and if the end of him is cut subtly, and does not pull on the stitch for good exception, you should know that you have inserted the end of that bone inside where the instrument has power to do so.
If you cannot reduce the bones of all that have been recommended, insert them inside where they should be, or use one of those bars in any way possible.
When you observe that the bone is rough and some of its edges are cut off, it is called a fracture.
When the bone is reduced and the pain in the thigh becomes very intense, you know that the bone does not return to its natural position; then do as you can to relieve the thigh.
When you have completed your restoration and applied the ointment to the bone, immerse your hand in a black stinking ointment, and do not pause on the plague or any other cause that may be present, so that no further damage or decay occurs.
And after the hour of the midnight complement of the bone restoration, and discovering the plague that has been scratched by sharp tools and used according to the amount of the plague.
And keep you all caution that you do not strain the plague at the fracture, for if many watches are made on the thighs, and there is damage or corrosion or sudden death, it will be sinful. If the second strain is more rigid, it is softer and different from the strains of other fractures.
If the plague is large or bad, and you fear that those accidents which have happened will recur, and cause pain in that place, then do not cover over those astels, but rather make them more firm by putting draps of hard cloth over them, and strengthen them with those am.
When the plague has already begun to manifest itself, that is, if there is inflammation in the area where you previously placed the cloth, and you need to maintain pressure, then place another cloth over the same area and administer medicine, as we usually do for plagues, such as tetrafarmacon and similar remedies.
It seems that you suggest that you should slide the limb and consider the plague in every day and evening when it is well-established and closed, and make sure that this member is prepared in such a way that the dressing runs from the part to the areas further away with ease.
If in the plague there are several days, and it is not yet consolidated or has not abscised from the inflamed area, then you should know that here are signs of small wounds that you should be concerned about the plague coming. And from those signs there are those that remain attached and extracted, those that of them are not separated and put the member and cause pain, then it is possible for you to insert the second one after the first one.
If you encounter the plague or cholera, it is a sign of another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then cover that part with a piece of cloth that suits the part of the body that needs treatment in the case mentioned in the preceding chapter.
And if you cover that part with what I have said and present your case: when it grows larger, lean over the member as if it were the thigh and the helper, and seem like those of the large members, and do not presume to attract or extract from it, nor does death occur due to that for about 20 or 30 days; and you cure the plague if you see it, and if not, then.
Chapter 20.
Of the cure of nodification that occurs in the healing of any fracture.
Nodification occurs in this cure in the healing of any fracture, and mainly that is seen in the joints, and it is pressed by the swelling; and very much you forbid the member from its natural operation.
When considering if the node is recent and administered in the medications that have antiseptic effects on the skin, eyes, mouth, anus, and genitals, and also on the limbs; it is necessary to take some or all of those, and apply them to the nodes with the antiseptic solution or albumen of blood, or saliva, and then place those over the node in a bandage, and secure them with good tension.
And the extension that does not close it in days; and if it does not close it, then repeat it another time, until it becomes firm on that layer of plum descentment, four plums having property of remaurant totally as much as is inflamed in the members.
If the node has already been converted into stone and is tightening, and causing great pain, and you cut it open through the part of the pus that is most separated, and insert the superfluous and eminent parts, or remove that which has been resected within which it is tightened; and cure it within which it is healthy.
I apologize, but I am unable to translate the provided text as it
When repairing a fracture, if it is restored and approximately follows the natural position of the bone, it is considered a successful repair.
When a bone fracture is repaired, if it is restored and approximately follows the natural position of the bone, there are several possible causes: one is the lack of proper liquification of the joint or ligament, not following the correct course; or due to excessive stricture of the ligaments within which nutrients cannot reach the member; or due to excessive embrocation; or due to movement that does not occur at the right time; or due to insufficient sinus in the thigh and debaque in the ligament.
And the cauterization is given to open the thigh and make the member stretch within which the sinus is multiplied, and administered with a bandage, and enter gaug and leticia over it.
And place a bandage over the member, so that the bandage attracts the correct nutrient to it, or continues embrocation of the wet substance, within which nutrients are allowed to flow and return to their natural figure.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the text you provided is not in a
This line seems to be discussing the treatment of bones that have been restored and are now prohibited from being operated on due to certain reasons. However, without more context, it's difficult to provide an accurate translation. Here's a literal translation:
When one has restored the member to health, according to the surgery for its tortuosity and eminence at the third and fourth phalanges, and it is in that form of the member, but the member is not prohibited from the natural operation of the wound, it does not mean that you receive the word of that which existed in that member is of a new trinity.
Many have already done folk remedies and restorations, and this operation is often criticized with great fear by the hand of the one who makes it, which is mortal.
If claudication and noderation are recent, it is said that they are infiltrated with water in the one who has them, as if they were fuels of altitude and roughness, like mellilot and similar to those; and it should be made with an emplastre of mollification, as the best dyallquilon can be made; or that it is a preference for the rasping of altea and it is contuced with gray of gualina or am oli of cirami, and it is applied to that; or that they are prefers of fat grasses and they are twisted with the fems of colom, and they are similar to those of the medicines that are named for the consolidation.
When some women are dissolved due to frequent rubbing of the skin that is dry and wet, and the member is moved in all directions at any time.
If the curvature of the bone is already bent and becomes more and more so, and it is necessary to go to the doctor for this, you will find that the pus is located in the lower part of the cavity and the continuation of the bone is dissolved, and it is cut off that which is superfluous from the bones that are being cut with sharp instruments, and there is an easy maintenance in that area of concern and study.
The text you've provided appears to be a medieval medical treatise written
in Latin, and it seems to be discussing the subject of dislocation or misplacement.
A dislocation is a sudden displacement of one of the joints of the limb, which prevents movement and causes the figure of the member to be distorted, leading to great pain and injuries.
When you encounter an dislocation, you should pierce as much as possible to reduce it, and do not delay in doing so, for if it is delayed, the area becomes inflamed and it becomes difficult to reduce the dislocation.
And so, do not think that it is not enough or tight in the moment of reduction, for many muscles are affected and it causes spasms and painful contractions.
If something happens, you should cover that you sit with the patient's groin, and place your hand over where the reduction is made; and the member should be held firmly by the tail and the tailor, and the reduction should be made easily.
And all members should be treated with care of that which causes the memorandum to come to their place.
And you have already ordered the capital of dislocation according to what precedes fracture; from the side of the head, push inside to the side where it is located.
Capitol xxiv.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the mandible from the side.
When the jaw bones are displaced and do not return to their place; and the displacement of the teeth is caused by one of two hands: either they are loose in their sockets for a short time, and then become soft; or they are completely displaced and locked, entering that it is soft at the joint between the cheek and the corner of the mouth, which cannot hold the tooth or close the mouth, and the tongue of the patient is enveloped in the throat.
When the displacement of the tooth is slight, it usually returns to its place for no apparent reason.
When the displacement of the tooth is complete and locked, it is necessary to administer a reduction of the jaw, and it should not be delayed for too long.
And is that the minister holds the cheek of the mouth, and inserts the doctor's hand between the teeth, either in the part where the jaw bone is displaced, or in both hands if it is displaced in two parts, and the others say that they are deformed for those who engage; and commands the mouth to close its jaws and release them from any part; and the doctor grips the jaw and releases the jaw when it returns to its original position.
If the reduction is difficult, and especially if the jaws are dislocated, you should administer an opiate injection of water and oil, and then enter that it is a slight reduction of the jaws and not a long-term reduction of the jaws, as they have said.
And when they return and the mouth is closed and not relaxed, you should rest on those powdered drugs of mercury, and it will be a little help in making the wounds less painful; and then it will be easier to dress them.
And if the man lies on his side, and his head is placed between two earpieces, so that it does not touch the part of the head that is to the right or left; and you do not force any cause; if the bed has been fastened with a leonine fetter, then when the pains are aggravated and the jaws are dislocated, you should know that it is time to call for help.
And if it is administered with ease, and you do not work on the edge of the mouth, but rather on the nutrition and bodily fluids, then when the jaw is dislocated and healed, you should know that it is time to call for help.
If it is difficult to reduce two jaws when they are dislocated at any time and not converted into their proper places, then you should make continuous movements of the eyes, which cause fevers and frequent sweating, and the belly of the patient becomes full, and the belly often vomiting pure choler.
And when you see this, you will know that it is lost; and eyesight moves towards that which has happened in that one day.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the shoulder and the end of the muscle.
The shoulder is not dislocated from the lats by its continuous movement in the belly; and some are dislocated to the wrong place, and that is declared by the sensation.
And the restoration of the same is that the patient lies on his side and extends his arms. And make sure to cover the place with your hand with strong pressure, so that it returns.
And place your hand over that plaster and powder and tighten that.
When the end of that which is being cut is continued to the edge, it should not be dislocated on any day; you should cover it and reduce and enwrap as has been said and as you appear to need.
And place your hand over that plaster, powder, and exfoliation, and command the thigh to adhere to the crest and to be peeled from there as it becomes healthy.
And when this cure is reduced, the end of the muscle is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the displacement of the muscle.
You should know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated at the beginning of the thigh to the end of the thigh.
And the second is that it is dislocated at the beginning of the muscle itself, and this is done through force; and it is not dislocated in the rear by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in the front by the nerves.
And the muscle is most dislocated and deformed in the parts beyond the thigh, and most in those where the bones are few, and less in those where there are many; and it is most difficult to set in those where there are many bones.
If many people suffer from impact or bruising, and the muscle of the patient is affected by cauterization, and it is because of this that it has already been dislocated.
I advise you to enter immediately if you are overwhelmed by the patient's care, and you will process in the cure of the patient.
It is known that the dislocation of the patient occurs when you leave the parts behind, so that you can distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the other muscles; and you touch between those differences in manifestation; and you touch at the top of the concave muscle and the cap of the muscle, and at the ankle it cannot reduce the force to the inner side of the knee, nor can it be held for all movements.
If it is dislocated, you need the pain or suspension, and you touch with your hand to feel the manifestation, and do not hesitate.
And this dislocation is made with a slight reduction when it is fresh and the ankle is young.
And the reduction of the patient is that the master lifts the force of the patient to the parts; and he places the hand on the top of the dislocated muscle, and raises the joint with strength in its own place, and the master lifts the force of the patient, and extends it there; and he places it afterward when it returns slightly.
If the pain does not return after a few days, and the dislocation began to occur, then it is possible that the thigh is swollen with water and needs to be treated with a poultice of linseed, millet, and honey, mixed with water, and applied.
Then the thigh should be placed on the patient's back and held in place with the doctor's hand, lifting the head of the muscle, and pulling the thigh towards the joints to prevent further damage, and another servant holds the thigh in place, so that it does not cause further damage. When this is done, the thigh should return to its original position.
And if you want to reduce the second one: and it is that you present a man who has a long thigh, and is from the side of that bone, and enters the muscle of the thigh with the titillate of the thigh and raises the titillate of the thigh to the parts where it will be suspended in the air, and another servant pulls the thigh away from the belly of the patient. When the thigh is injured, it is necessary to cover that which is hung, because that other cause is suspended, so that the dislocation returns as much as possible.
When the swelling is reduced by another hand: and it remains on the ground a long bone of its head, like a piece of mortar, which is neither thick nor fine, and is placed at the end of the thigh; then place your hand on the top of the bone of the leg, and the thigh is placed secondary to the length of the bone, and extend the arm of you over the parts of the other part; and extend the arm of the other part for strength, so that the joint returns to its original position quickly.
If it is difficult to reduce the joint by all causes that have been said, then use this treatment: and if you take a bone of the quantity that is in the long of two brasses, and the length of which is four fingers, and the largest part of it is located at the top of the tittilic according to this form:
Then place your hand on the reduced part with claws as if the bone does not affect the thigh.
And place your hand at the end of the thigh, and extend the arm or the other arm over the bone that enters into the parts behind, and see the bone on the assistant and the arm and the end of the arm.
And place the arm over a scale according to latitude, and let it be extended to the parts beyond that, and the other part be suspended from the other side, so that the joint does not come out of its place.
When the joint of the patient is completed according to any method that you can possibly do, and you cover that you pause from me after the tightening of the titillating part of the lana de engual with enough quantity; and you pause applying a plaster prepared with powder of mollusk shells and albumen of hooves over all the muscle, so that it revolves as before, and you strengthen it furthermore the titillating part with stricture decent; and the liament is revolve over the plaster, and the member of the patient is annexed to the col of the patient, and it is lessened, and not harmed the member of the patient for seven days.
And cover that the food of the patient is little, and when this member is comfortable, then what is pushed to the sanacion of the patient.
And if the food is given more in seven or eight days or exercises a movement; and then if it stops and does not soften, you have already been healed.
If the joint is dislocated by movements seen due to humidity that happens to it or by another cause, you cover that in that case, three points are administered cauterization, according to what is said in the capital of cauterization.
If everything is done correctly and it takes about three days for the joint to heal and the joint does not remain closed, and the plaster and stricture are reduced over some wounds, and do not remain closed and cannot raise that arm to the parts desired, you know that those nerves of yours, which are at the top of the muscle, have already been inscribed or extended or made smooth, and you know that the joint will not remain closed in its place for long.
From the dislocation of that which is made you need the chest and the nipples or the parts behind, the reduction is made with impulse and extension to the maximum, but when it returns.
And if another stricture is administered there, and cures that which is healed within.
If the cure is delayed too much in the member and the movement of it, you use the thigh or the knee over that when that gravity is removed and it returns to its original nature.
Chapter 27.
Of the cure of the dislocation of the thigh.
You know that the knee joint is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all parts, and particularly in the part adjacent to the part behind, and the dislocation of the knee does not depend on your effort to stretch or stretch the other leg, and when you adjust the dislocated knee, it is clearly declared to you that the knee joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor touch that the other muscle.
And cover the joints, and reduce the dislocation as much as possible that it comes to the gout cautery, where if you see the gout cautery, difficult is the reduction of it, and more easily when it is in the rear parts, and most of all when it is in the other species of dislocation, and more pain, and unseen motions of that knee.
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the leg of it is extended as much as possible, and the arm of it is expanded, and the most of the doctor's fingers are over the knee and below it, and he presses the joint with his fingers on the bones of its knees or on the palm of his hand entering therein as it turns in its place.
If the displacement is in the parts that are doubled, then return to your hand what doubling it was for your hand, entering where it pierces the palm of your hand.
And if the displacement does not comply with the reduction, then administer vehement extension and firm movement.
And it is that two ministers extend the arm, and hold that extension with those two ministers so that the extension is not harmed by the extension.
And if it is necessary to rotate the arm, you must turn the entire part, because it will be wrapped around the doubled long over the hand of the patient, or limb.
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, apply that oil to that part so that it is those causes that help in lubrication of the joint and facilitate; and press the joint with a firm push within which returns.
And the reduction of that cover that is placed over that ointment which is sterilized and exfoliated in the album of the wound, and is extended over the stricture descent, and the arm is hung from the collar, and is laid for a few days.
When the joint is formed in the desired location, then you should cut the tendon of the patient and leave it there.
If you see that the joint is not tightening, then you should apply plaster to the tendon and leave it there for several days until it becomes tightened; and then cut it.
If you see that the joint is not reducing in size, and the disposition of the patient is moving, then you should apply moisture to the skin and gentle pressure, and compression, within which the patient is released; or place a cushion on the reduced joint, it is a fatty joint; and then cut the tendon, and leave it there over the bone and the nail. And then put on a bandage; and when you dry it, then you should gently rub the joint with the reduced tendon, and then go over that reduced joint, which is moving slowly, one way and the other, and the third. I am in bandages, when it is limited.
And if you want, place a bandage over that wet and sanded cow's horn, and apply pressure on that; and make some turns, four of them, around that, and reduce it to its position.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided text "Capitol .xxv
De curacio de dislocacio de malassen, so es de la junctura que es entre·l bras e la ma.
When a joint is dislocated in some part of the body and the reduction of the dislocation is difficult, and it is not due to other dislocations, but rather because of the speed at which the reduction can be made in that particular joint at the time of the displacement, it is likely that the location is edematous or that there is an issue with the edema of that specific joint.
The reduction of the dislocation is achieved by placing the joint of the patient's thigh over a table and extending the hand of that leg, and then pressing on the elbow or palm of the other arm against the prominence of the joint, and pushing it back to its original position.
However, it is likely that this should be considered if the palm is already on the abdomen of the thigh, then the patient's hand should press the two hands of their own thigh on a table to extend and reduce; and if the dislocation precedes the two hands of the thigh, then the position of the thigh of the metge should be placed over the immediacy of the joint on the table, so that the palm of the patient can press on the prominence of the joint.
If the swelling returns as soon as it leaves, that is good; but if not, tighten that which you have separated from the scar and lay it aside; and do not wait any longer, for if you do not help or cannot in the reduction of the pus that passes through the days.
However, the joint pain follows its own course; and I do not notice any cause in the thigh, except that it is softened and cannot be strengthened by any cause; you should know that the nerves are divided or compressed, and you are not engaged in it unless it is tightened with a cautery at the base of the toe and fort with enough force to confirm some cause.
If the swelling returns as soon as it leaves, you should stop on the empastre that has been recommended, and let it be laid aside and tightened for several days; and then it should be deslided and laid aside and the pain of the patient should be exercised.
If the movement of the patient is not stopped and happens to be severe, you should relax that which has been tightened and let it be soaked in water with some vinegar and let it dry before being removed.

Of the cure of dislocations of the fingers.
When some joints are dislocated in the entire limb.
And when some fingers are dislocated at the back of the hand or in the abdomen of the patient, then push the finger and return it to its place, if possible.
And hold the finger tightly, suspend the finger above the part where it is dislocated, and leave it there for two days.
And suspend the finger and extend it when it is dry in that day.
And when it rains, read that second part of the story and do not continue to slide it in the day and exercise it with movement, and read that again; and do this for several days until it is straight.
And make it appear as if this is the case, if it is dislocated in the abdomen of the patient, and hold it there and perform the first operation again when it is cured.
And in the same way make it appear as if this is the case when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter.xxx.
Of the treatment of spinal dislocation.
When an injury occurs to any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and there are many more vertebrae in other parts of the body, they do not receive treatment, and death comes to the buttocks.
When it comes to the matter of the patient's menstruation, it is not within their will to hold back; and if they are seen, it is softened by the members of the body or the changes in the body or the breasts, or one of those; or a spinal column is made at that location, where four parts are made and four parts are removed.
And that has already been divided into the back parts and is not narrowed.
The treatment of the patient is that if the narrowing occurs due to puberty, then that is not treated or cured in that part or in that part alone.
In that which is felt or percussed or seems to be in those parts, the ancients had many ways of treating, of which the least profitable was returned to the most profitable; and you have already been opened for that which has caused too much pain in the patient, due to the proximity of the exposed part, of which I have explained and made instruments of different types for that which is shown and expanded there.
And of those, it is not cured except for the one that occurs in the two parts mentioned by me, as I recommend.
And if the patient's thigh is extended over his face as far as possible, and it is extended further down the stomach to prevent the chest from being compressed, the chest will not be hurt.
And place another cushion at the end of the thigh around the head of the patient, and another cushion on the other end of the pillow.
And the midwife holds the cushion, and does not stop in the socket; and another midwife holds the other side in that form.
And cover the head of the patient and pull the string tight; and extend the end of the string to the cushion that you need for the head of the patient, and tie it there; and stretch the other string over the ankles of the patient's legs, and adjust all the strings and tie them on the other cushion that you need for the feet of the patient.
And if the physician extends the limb to the point of the knee, and does not cause any pain to the two knees and the limbs in which they are inserted, but rather does not stop until it is done as they have said.
And the physician places his hands over the spine for strength until it returns, or places them on that one table, and adjusts the weight of the feet as it returns.
If it does not return in this way, then you take a table of which the latitude or longitude is three degrees, and dig into the side of the table where they have said that one end of the maze is located in the extreme part of the table. And the physician stops the track of the table over the spine, and the physician places his feet on the other end, and then enters as soon as the spine is straight and returns to the original location.
And if you wish, open the door that turns the maze. And it is necessary for you to stand on the ground, as the cap of the maze is at the end of the two knees, the longitude of which is a hand's breadth, and the cap must be at the end of the two knees, and each hand must turn one revolution, and each must not remain on the ground for so long that it causes pain.
When a stone is lodged in the urinary passage, and it does not pass, it is necessary to make an incision in the abdomen and draw out the stone with forceps. The incision should be made on the side where the stone is located, and the forceps should be inserted through the urethra.
At the end of the stone, there is a narrow passage formed by the urethra, the length of which is similar to that of a cock's comb; in the other two urethras, it resembles this.
Then tightly tie the strings that you have tied in the abdomen at the top of the stone, and the strings that you have tied in the thighs at the bottom of the stone.
Then each point must have a minister who tightens the point with his hand and makes the spine bend according to what has been said.
Then the spine is returned to its original position and the area is relaxed, as if you were pressing an excised piece of flesh against the album of the thigh, and then stop; and place your hand over the excised piece of flesh that is three inches wide or more, and the length of the spine is the amount you took from the area of the whiteness, and over the end of the spine it is.
When you have found the part that was mentioned, and use the medicinal food subtle within which it is healthy.
If you find any signs of inflammation in the end of the cure, know that certain medicines have been administered that moisten and dilute the administration table for a long time, which have been recommended; and already, in that place, the liniment has been applied.
If some signs of inflammation appear in the back of the spines of the two, and it is due to that dislocation; and that part of the one who has already had it, so that it does not cover that it is a proper cure for this medicine, as much as you can add to your death.
Chapter 31.
Of the cure of a dislocated ankle.
You know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the muscle do not always mean dislocation, but only in such cases, and does not happen to those that happen to the other small removals and hollowings.
And when the joint of the ankle is dislocated, it is done in four ways, that is, by the parts of the fingers, or by the parts of the forehead, or by the parts of the chin, or by the parts behind.
When the joints are dislocated, it is mainly in the fingers and less so in the knuckles or back of the hand.
And when the dislocation of the joint is seen, it is clear that the hand is too long and the thumb is too prominent, and the hand cannot be bent without causing pain, and this is the place where you must apply the cautery for cautery apoplexy, since the end of the thigh has already arrived here.
And that is the reason for the injury seen in that place, because the accidents of the hand are opposite to this accident.
And when the dislocation of the joint is seen in the knuckles, it is clear that the hand is too tight and does not cause pain in the thumb, and if it is pierced through the anus, it cannot be over there; and the urine of the patient is retained and the penis is cautery apoplexy, and you must place the ambulance on the sole.
And when the dislocation of the joint is seen in the back of the hand, it is clear that the thumb does not expand and cannot be bent by bending the knuckles, and the hand is shorter than the other, and the penis is softened, and the end of the thigh is at that place.
The first source sentence to translate is: "Mays reduccio de las specias de aquesta dislocacio es que tu consideras, lahoras, si la dislocacio es vetusta et antiqua, que ja es anticada am le havent aquela aprop tu aministras reduccio de lu e roman segon la sua disposicio, lahoras no es en aquela curacio de tot; e adonc no cove que en aquela sia fayta prosompcio.
When the dislocation is recent in that particular part, and it is one of the four types of dislocations, then you must pull towards where the joint is stuck and extend it to the parts of the fingers and the parts of the thumb, and also to the right and left, as much as it can return without requiring another treatment.
If the dislocation does not return in this manner, then you must prepare to stretch the bone of that part further forward, or as much as it can, or as much as possible; and another person stretches the end of that bone as far as it can reach the fingertips; and hold down the tendon on the top of the thigh, and hold another person at the end of the tendon.
And if it is extension of the bone or of the finger to the angle of the elbow to the angle of the shoulder, or to the angle behind the thumb.
And if it is the extension of all those to a single direction within which the thigh is raised and the leg hangs down.
This type of extension is specific to all four.
When the dislocation returns, as they say, then do nothing; but if it does not return, then you must use everything possible to speak about your own cure.
In the reduction of the own, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is in the parts of the finger, know that the thigh should be pressed against the side as if it were hanging on the end of the thumb in that place where the head of the thigh meets the point where the elbow is; and extend the limb from the part of the shoulder to the other part of the wrist.
And if another stronger minister takes the braces of the thigh and pulls out the large end of the thigh, and extends the parts of the thigh apart for extension, so that it returns to its original position.
This method is used to perform this curative procedure in which this member is reduced that the other methods do not.
If you do not obey the instructions of this method of curing and do not follow the rules, then know that the two ends of the thigh are attached to the strong, firm limb, and the toes and heels are tightened.
When measuring the length of a part of the body according to the quantity of four digits, and the malady's extent is greater than the other by two digits, it is considered severe.

The elbow is dislocated in three ways: first, by the parts in front, second, by the parts on the side, and third, by the parts behind; and the parts that are not dislocated are not dislocated.
And the sign of elbow dislocation is that you command the thigh to apply its cushion to the buttock; you know that the elbow is dislocated.

If you are prohibited from reducing the leg as recommended, make a jam over the patient's thigh on the ground, and create a flat mattress on the ground, and place it between the patient's legs, and you have already covered the patient with a cloth that does not expose the leg.
When the minister holds the patient's thighs, and another minister extends the foot over the patient's knees or the calf that lies on the back of the foot; and extends that same minister against the extension of the thigh, and the hand is present between the patient's thighs, retaining it, so that this part of the leg does not become inflamed beyond its extension.

Capitulum XXXV.
Of the species of dislocation that are caused by plague or fracture or in any other way.
When an accident occurs of that kind, and you are in the cure of that and in the restoration of it, you may see that success follows.
And therefore it is not to be presumed that in the cure of the patient one knows what is best, but rather what is in the art, after long experience, mercy, and compassion, gradually, not hastily nor presumptuously; and that one should use the beginnings of medicines that are given aspostemas only, and leave the thigh to divine judgment, not to that which one hopes for salvation from perdition, but to that which brings relief from malady, and in which there is some hope. When you finally begin to work on the patient's reduction at the beginning of the cause, it will lead to an incision with a cautery.
If the member returns as you want, apply the necessary medication that contains cautery and cures the wound as desired for the drying of the engorged areas.
If dislocation is considered a fracture and occurs in the separated bones, you should perforate the stem of these, and do as has been said in the simple diseases of this, that it is preceded in the places of those.
And keep and avoid according to your virtue that intrusion in the ways of fear following what precedes my preaching; for thus it is better for you to serve the true Creator, and less permanent for your glory, and less salutations to you as you see those in your time. This is the end of the paragraphs of Albucasim perfectly made from which God will not be benefited. Amen.
