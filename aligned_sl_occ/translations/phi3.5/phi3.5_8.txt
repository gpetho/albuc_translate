Oh children, you have completed this book of medicine before your eyes (the subject), and through its exposition (explanations) and declarations (statements or facts presented within the text), I see that you comprehend what is being discussed here—this part divided by surgery.
When the operation is considered over in our region and at all times private, until I see you here with my science; and not a single detail escapes me from these small descriptions found freely among Ancients' works, which I will modify to correct errors and understand intentions fully, thus elongating knowledge and art.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And I have seen that you need it for reviving the order of this treatise in accordance with its exposure and declaration stages; so as to restore the forms of cautery tools and other instruments used, which is necessary for completion.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Through what Hippocrates says is at play here, may it be small in scope and mainly within the body itself.
May we already have told you about it in the entrance of this book; who does not know what we have told them about anatomy, will fall into error and serve death if they haven'thy seen much of these things themselves, for those are formed by understanding this science and its experiments.
Here is the line-by-line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
Here comes another doctor who prescribes that the patient drink a stone from a well which had been processed in his state, and this stone was large; brought it to him with a ladle from the water jar, so that by the third day, that home (the patient) died.
And you have already summoned that one over here to extract it because of the greatness of the stone and due to its position in relation to the womb, so they will die under us.
And another doctor took the salary of our duke for surgery, and brought with him an iron implement that had fractured his thigh; due to the surgeon's ignorance, he mishandled the fracture on the ground using strong pillows and beds.
Here is the line-by extralined translation:
And you have called upon it (the patient), and prepared to loosen the ligament, thus obtaining calmness and relief from their pains.
Even though decay has been confirmed in the limb, so that it cannot be restrained and will not stop wandering within the scope of the malady.
And another doctor pierced an apendicitis (appendicitis), and it ruptured within days; as the wickedness of him grew towards his lord.
The cause is that the head will be cut for excessive melancholalgy (depressed humor), and not all of it shall come to you but rather the member wherein ye have been hosted from start till now.
And for this reason, boys, it is necessary that the operation be planned in two aspects: one related to health (healing) and another associated with risk (major procedures).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "E yeu ja he exsitat aquo en tot loc de aquest libre en le qual venc opperacio en la qual es error e temor; per que necessari es a vos que guardetz aquo e layssetz aquel, per que les folhs no atrobo via a parlar e a vos desonestar.
And so take up your weapons for solicitation and protection, and your illnesses for fortification and strengthening.
Here comes the translation of this medieval medical treatise line by line into English:
Quan dolor de juncturas son faytas per humors fregas les quals so enfundutz a quascun membre del cors, When illness is not arthritis, doctors will not name it.
And you already occupy this second volume with three chapters.
Begins the division of free will, starting from the primary partition. The ordered first chapter within the feet, in terms of instruments and tools for caulters, what is needed therein?
The division of the second partition. The Second Chapter of cautery and perforation, and of pills, potions, extractions from herbs and similars for those things, all is arranged according to the forms of these instruments.
The third pillar of restoration and displacement, as well as the care for twisting and appearance to these individuals; ordered by the head within the body'supositions indicate a structured approach in medieval medicine towards diagnosing and treating certain conditions such as sprain (twist) or contortion. Here 'capitol,' likely referring to medical practice, outlines three key areas: restoration ('restauracio'), which could mean helping the body recover from injury; displacement ('dislocacio'), possibly indicating how misalignments in
Where they examine the quality of both movement and flesh (likely referring to a careful assessment or treatment plan), with specific instructions on when it is not advisable to use such treatments ('cautery'). This highlights an important aspect in medieval medicine: tailored, patient-specific approaches that consider individual conditions. Here 'cauci' refers back to the cauterization tools used by doctors for treatment or possibly wound management
Thus the topic of cauterization's effect on body and soul is long and complex; subtle by science yet hidden in secrets (this suggests that understanding these treatments requires not only medical knowledge but also insight into their deeper implications). They discuss it extensively among themselves, often disagreeing or having differing opinions ('temen perlonguo'), leaving me just a small part of the larger conversation. Here 'sermo' means dialogue and could refer to scholarly discourse on medicine at that time—full of depth but also possibly shrouded in confidentiality due to its sensitive nature about treatments like cauterization, which may have involved trade secrets or proprietary knowledge among practitioners. This underscs the complexity not only within medical practices themselves (the technicalities and disagreements) but also amongst those who practice them ('temen perlonguo').
And it is said that the pointed cautery comforts the entire body universally, except for two kinds of complexes which are parts of its matter - namely, tail-like parts.
In the complex tail and dry matter it separates; they disperse salves that benefit that part, and others apply them to its opposite, which are not suitable for illness characterized by quality and dryness—whereas nature of the focus is both quality and dryness, making treatment with such liquids beneficial.
Here comes the first sentence to translate:
And as for the speech of that person, I have already discovered some things by experimentation with them myself.
Mightily not when the one who has already been examined and practiced cautery on yesterday' extricates themselves from it for further exercise, understanding the complexity of human composition as well as the disposition of diseases within their bodies, along with the causes of those ailments and timing thereof.
May also occur in other complexities, not out of fear but mainly due to excessive cold and wet humors, which is why all doctors agree on treating them therein with caution.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May the medicine burn reach that in their limbs which they have neglected and force them to come forth into the diseased member difficultly cured, thus compelling it outward with its treatment.
May the fire (likely referring to a treatment method), because of its sublimation and beneficial substance, does not produce anything but excess. We have already become known through experiment and long-term study in this art concerning truth about causes; therefore we are excused from lengthy discourse here at rest while holding your hands on the focus area, as it will demonstrate a philosophical proof of our actions performed on the body'dictus (likely referring to curative techniques), which if understood properly can alleviate pain in their pains.
And learned physicians understand that it is best in the early part of the year to perform cauterizations and pauses for the most benefit.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: "And it is said that cautery is convenient at all times, for thus harm caused by water (the fluid used in cauterization) remains where applied and tends mainly when necessary due to pains or necessities such as fistulas and abscesses which do not delay because of the fear of malice acting on them; this greater damage occurring over time is considered worse than minor harm coming through periods.

Even though there are unnecessary tools used in medicine due to the patient'se flow and vitality of operation, as well as the greatness of their lord.
It is possible that the illness may return at some time during the day according to the complexity of the disease and its location in the body, as well as what has been prepared on their feet by excess fluids retained from those causes; but if cautery is administered for pain or semblance due to small surplus quantities and humidity, it may also prevent that same pain here (in this place), possibly occurring in the foot.
Even though it is vulgar speech that we use for medicine practices here, and not the proper language of physicians which I understand as ineffective treatment neither by myself nor by others at these removals.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And now that we use caustics for medicine treatment according to what is commonly understood by doctors and others.
And those made of gold are better than those made of iron for caulters (instruments used to apply heat or fire), and they were not carried unless necessary due to their equality in weight with silver and the purity/sublimation of its substance.
Even when the use of cautery does not produce heat as intended (for that which is used in this practice should generate warmth), they prepare and apply it, realizing its superior quality to iron needles for these purposes; however, if you are using a piece of cautery made from gold at the focus point, adjust according to how much force one wishes to inflict upon silver (the material being used by them). Furthermore, when lighting an ignition in this area, the fire will engulf it. And should sparks fly off as a result during its operation, that is because of the tool's occupancy therein for said purpose.
Through this water, we apply iron needles and insert them properly for the operation.
And in the instruments of cautery as outlined hereinbelow, they have arranged those within their feet, ensuring that anyone seeking help from them can get what they need.
The First Chapter (assuming "Le capitol" refers to the
The First Chapter: Here you will apply moisture and cold on the accident wound that is causing these reasons; it stems from too much fluid discharge (likely referring to edema), urgent care needs, ranging from hip pains to elbow movements, prolonged sleeping periods, dental pain, general suffering caused by frostbite, potential paralysis along with hardness and apoplexy (bleeding in the brain), as well-like symptoms within these illnesses.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the hump to be expelled through medical suction for three or four days, according to the urgency of the hump and the patient'sup age and habitus.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return his head with forceps and place that sponge between your hands on a raised bed, keeping it above their chest.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return your hand and observe the place; if you find any amount of bone in the shoulder that has been exposed (possibly due to an injury or dislocation), raise it as much as there is grief moaning, holding its position either with this one iron tool hereby provided for such purpose, or another. If chilled by cold, enter where you have seen mentioned on bone by the doctor previously stated.
Return the intestine or hernia into its cavity, and place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not protrude outward. Apply a small amount of salt and dissolve it on the location for three days.
Return your hand over his chest where it has begun, and place that thereon which was destroyed by the focus's blade. Return care for the location where the snake'thy concoction is within so that it may heal.
And when a patient has urinated (diyser), and the child goes to pour water over their bracelets (geta), it is better for health and may even be beneficial.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And it is that they will have their navel cauterized within the body, and hold the instruments inside until some portion of the dissected part has dried out.
When it is necessary for humors (body fluids) that have accumulated in bone marrow to be drained away and when care must take place, so: the patient needs immediate attention/treatment.
There are others who come to the crucible through which they will enter and exit into bone (their skeleton), entering while it is tightly closed within until it cracks open; this is how small healing takes place. E from that place exhale the humors of the head.
If the patient has had it for a long time and if they are cured within that period of being secured or stabilized.
May I not see all these various cautery tools at once; only in wise homes through fear they are used – and this one should be better for my health if I use it when the head is raised by solace, especially since we have testified here about other members' ailments, primarily when the head of the thigh protrudes naturally.
And if it is possible that this initial form of cautery may save and be more beneficial than anything else, then from that vase (pot) where the water resides, draw some for health benefits.
Capital Second.
Of the pointed cautery of the head.
When in the whole head there is chronic and long-lasting pain, it lies extended within the malady, using swords and scalpels and crown drills and instruments of burning and nail hammers and weights, as well as servants for assistance—mostly if any cauterization has already been performed on one's body with a heated instrument that does not further investigate into these causes. They consider it especially so when the head swelling is due to significant thickening in its nature; but this should not be excessive harm, and thus another form of cautery will then also apply itself upon said area (the one previously treated). Return that tool over the top of your head for cauterization, until the penis is cut open. Cut the bone and expose its quantity that we have recorded and seal it with a cauterium in the back part of the head where it has been called upon (this is also where suction was applied). And lift your hand so high, that you do not see the patient' extricable parts; for when this humoral imbalance causes great pain different from the pains of other caustics applied to the head.
Here the lancet is used in its place, so that this very same instrument will be employed to burn away corns on the head and back (where it has been carefully applied), which constitutes its form of treatment.

When the severe pain of arthritis is present or when there's a kindling sensation within the joint (or bone), it is incumbent upon physicians to apply immediate measures; and they must administer either acute combustion treatment, which I have described in various aspects related to diseases, or application with iron.
May cupping implements of medicine burn so that you grasp a vessel of brass and remove the limbs from both heads. Return and strike the location of pain on one side with a sharp lance within where it is hidden under flesh for so long that even bone cannot be seen as its hiding place; then pierce therein to alleviate suffering.

and it is called a closed knot or lockpicking form, in which the head of the patient's body part resembles a small rose (carnation), and its position at this place on the body also significant.
Return the pause over the location of pain and hold your hand—so that the iron needle does not harden quickly, which happens when it is used for too long—and turn the small iron gradually by speed to avoid discomfort or injury.
If the amount of blood collected through the speculum inserted into the catheter is enough for your hand to prevent the artery from being compressed further, thereby avoiding bleeding out (the flow of bile).

When you treat ancient emigrants with what has been said about their cure, and what has been mentioned in the divisions of illnesses; if not improving care, when a pain that is beyond our remedy for topical or cutaneous caustics remains—point to where it lies along this long line which represents its essence. Place your hand carefully within these bounds as you handle cautery instruments (possibly implying the use of metal tools) with great precision and care, ensdicting that even a simple instrument like tongs must be used delicately during treatment.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuous motion of the jaw that grinds its teeth (bruxism), and ensure that there is no strain on the muscles involved in this action, so as not to provoke a spasm.
If it is about the custody and caution of the flow of blood from the artery, there is fear in him who does not know what makes it happen and doesn'thy studies or precautions are directed towards that; thus perform surgery on him with care.
And when they come back for memory of the regimen of flow or sanction from the acorn according to their medical practice here in this place.
If you feel this illness that does not supply the necessary heat for the cautery and affects part of the body (the abdomen), then anneal it at the head'thy place as we have described, and care for the patient until they are healed.
If you wish, administer the same caustic that we have discussed in this chapter of thermal acid application using two lancets for better and more effective treatment.

When you treat that particular type of torture and cleaning the area around joints and genitals without discomfort in your treatment, it is necessary to use three cauterizations: one with a golden hair needle (and likely refers to some form of heating tool), another using small touches from its temple, and finally holding together both lips.
And apply the pointed cautery on the contrary parts of the ill area, where only healing is seen thereafter.
When performing cauterization, you apply the instrument at the tip of your finger on the top of the head'se crown and in the temple area; its length corresponds to that of the patient's body part being treated, ensuring that the amount used for cautery is appropriate based on the size of their skull bone.
This is how the pointed cautery works and it belongs specifically to barber surgeons (barbers who also performed surgical procedures), which they present now. Even though one may have barely escaped, and there is a surplus of excessive flesh on them now; put under it something subtle to cover the exposed part.

In this line, a specific treatment involving cauterization is suggested for individuals who might attempt self-remedy. The procedure requires careful placement and execution by oneself: "Three lancing procedures should be conducted carefully on designated spots over your head at the temples (the side areas near ears). And there is space between each of these instruments, and pay attention to what comes from the water that flows into them.

"So that we can cleanse the brain with it at once and for its other curative purposes, as in cases where phlegm is great or when medicine exceeds tolerance." – Here, a treatment involving some kind of substance (potentially an elixir) was believed to be effective both immediately ("at once") and over time. It's used specifically for conditions associated with excessive "phlegm," according to medieval medical understanding that could refer metappective or literal phlegma within the body, possibly due to a humoral imbalance as per Humorism theory prevalent at the time.
"If it is an infant that does not suffer from the medicines, administer grease and mustard to moisten the cleaner applied above, by spitting out daily for its digestive benefits." – This line suggests a treatment protocol where if infants are given remedies (likely intended as treatments), those who do not respond should be treated with ointment-like substances like grease and mustard. The application of these agents might involve the patient spitting out any excess material, likely through gargling or similar action to aid digestion – a practice reflect

It describes a treatment where phlegm from beneath the scalp—believed possibly linked with brain disturbanzement and seizure activity according to humoral imbalances of that era—was physically removed or altered by rasping If the humors are strong and tolerant, then you will apply those same points for paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the back and of the two (i.m., pelvis/hip).

From the phrase "cauterize the patient's eyelids when the hair turns into parts and pick up the patient with tweezers," we can deduce that this line refers to an ancient medical procedure where a practitioner uses cautery (a method of treatment involving burning) on someone’s e
Translation: When the patient's hair turns into sharp parts and I pick up (the) individual, there are two methods for proceeding; either apply heat or use medicine to burn them out. The text suggests that in cases where a person has their hair break down into dangerous points ("partes dedintz"), causing injury upon being handled by hand ('pungo le huel'), the doctor might choose between applying thermal treatment, which could involve using something heated (cauterization with heat), or medicinal burning to remove these sharp parts and alleviate pain. This reflects an
The line translates as: "If I use cautery (a heating instrument), command the patient to let their hair be cut with these tools, ensuring they are extended and wrapped tightly; if by hand removal is required for those who object ('deves le lor naysement'), then bind one strand at a time around them so that no more of it may come out until all have been removed." Here the physician details an approach where hair (presumably from wounds or surgical sites) needs to be managed, with cautery being used for cutting and binding as necessary. This method ensures controlled removal ("não seja mauguto") in a way that minimizes further damage ('no more of it may come out') until the entire problematic hair has been addressed (all have been removed). The emphasis on extension tightness suggests an attempt to prevent any loose threads from causing issues. This line provides insight into historical medical practices related to wound care and suture application, highlighting how treatments

And if it is pressed by certain thorns, or if not expelled by them, a fresh stone will be present; and its pain may originate from where the discomfort is felt—in the hollow of the thigh, in the groin area, or on the limb, lying there.

You understand that it is not the one using these treatments with caustics (burns, often involving substances like acid or heat) but rather for expelling matter from the body as part of their healing methodology; this suggests a preference in ancient medicine practices towards more natural remedies and external applications to balance bodily
According to Scorcesius (Apuleius), when the superficial vein is cauterized it absorbs moisture from the body; and so with these caustic applications: either a woolen thread or ointment imbued in oil, applied between the sole of one's foot and thigh/groin area to create this treatment barrier. This passage reveals an ancient technique where specific materials were used for topical treatments aiming at absorbing fluids (moisture) while also providing some protective measure against further fluid imbalance in these areas, indicative of a time when medical practices intertwined closely with practical and readily available resources.
Here is the line-by-line translation: Return and do not cease applying water until the vengefulness of the knife'falcon penetrates into the navel, then pause the pain.

Some pains are in the two (presumably referring to legs) due to clogging or impact/percussion events and for reasons related herein described, through application of moist and fluid substances used as a poultice. The text suggests that these types of pain may occur when there is an obstruction causing pressure ('cazement' could refer to blockage), physical trauma such as hitting or being hit by something (impact/percussion events might be related injuries caused by collisions, possibly during heavy labor common in medieval times), and for reasons associated with excessive bowel movements. The remedy proposed is the
And rather than simply using points, employ this specific substance for which you are skilled in making poultices (cauterization here refers to the application of a topical treatment made from pessulgium or similar material). Here 'es fayta' indicates that there is expertise involved in preparing these medicinal applications
Thus take care of the patient's discharge from obstruction by using plugged or inserted pillows and likenesses (presumably tools for applying pressure, such as pads made from medicinal herbs), which are skilled in being placed over three lines following this guide. Insert fingers into any one line where necessary depending on how much the patient can tolerate of these treatments ('tolleransa') and their state or condition (referred to here as 'vertut'). The phrase suggests a hands-on approach, utilizing manual pressure techniques in conjunction with poultices at specific points along three lines for symptomatic relief. Here the practitioner is advised on how much intervention might be necessary based upon individual patient responses and comfort levels ('tollersansa' refers to tolerance) during treatment ("vertut" could refer to condition or state of health). The text combines traditional manual therapy with topical remedies as part of the medieval healing process.
And if it is necessary for a point of pain (cause), then use pointed cautery as needed/for treatment purposes.
If you wish, then apply three or four hot irons in this manner as a form of cautery.

And when gout is healed by the treatment and there are no more pains left over, then apply treatments to remove pain with lancets (needles).
When you cauterize that which is expelled within the joint' extrication loop, along with other instruments of cautery.
And this is the form of that pointed cautery you are using:
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery for that purpose. If the pains pierce into the abdomen or other joints and these movements provoke spasms, then treat that spot on any of those parts with three to four lancets belonging entirely to this very cautery set.
If you need more lancets that these lancets are necessary for you, then properly anoint your hand with oil so as not to press too hard on the previous lancer when inserting it nowhere else but at the site of insertion in the catheter.
If pain enters into both joints (hips and shoulders), then apply the previously mentioned cautions accordingly.
If the pains are only in the limbs and it is called sourness (likely referring to a condition related to digestive imbalances), then pricking along the circuit of these flames occurs at those two lines, puncturing them.

(The sentence suggests a practical approach for treating conditions like an inguinal hernia, where manual support with one's hands is recommended after physically repositioning any displaced organ back into its proper place.)
You have already opened the space between your patient' extramammary (outside of their breast) and now place a cushion under them; another servant supports one leg thereof while yet another rests on his chest holding onto his hands, indicating that you are managing multiple aspects simultaneously for comfort or treatment. This could involve care after childbirth to relieve pressure from the abdomen (cushions and support), as well as hand placement suggesting a holistic approach involving touch reassurance in addition to physical remedies during labor.
After you have ceased the use of needles on that specific part (indicating careful rest and possibly healing), allow your hands to be at ease there, as they too are subjected nightly until daybreak; continue this routine if it wasn't achieved in the first attempt. This reflects a medieval medical practice where care for both physical body parts like those needing cauterization (treated with fire or other heat methods) and hands is necessary after an intervention, emphasizing rest as part of healing – even mentioning nightly observation highlights how sleep was considered therapeutic. It also speaks to the meticulous attention doctors paid not just to visible injuries but also overall wellbeing during treatment cycles which could span several days or weeks in medieval times, aligning with current understandings of rest and recovery as critical components for healing wounds before re-

When pain persists in the upper body through methods like crushing or tapping and does not relieve itself with standard medical care, it is those who perform point heating that are said to be treating points of heat as a form of treatment for relief from this enduring discomfort. (This translation interprets "endeve" possibly meaning chronic ("for long periods") or severe pain and assumes the intended context revolves around using cauterization, which is an ancient medical technique that involves burning to remove diseased tissue.)
Whether the application of heat treatments to all parts according to their size and complexity, as well as locations prone to discomfort or pain (torque). Here "tot membre" refers not just body but could imply each aspect related to it; therefore, a comprehensive approach is suggested for addressing areas where there may be torque-related issues. The phrase suggests that cauterization techniques should consider the entirety of affected parts
Therefore if the first application of heat treatments is sufficient for healing; else, repeat these applications on that body part which appropriately corresponds to where pain originates in order for those who continue with treatment actions (heating) inside this malady area so that each subsequent cauterization aims at curing it. The statement here seems to be about the iterative nature of healing using heat, suggesting multiple treatments may follow one another until complete recovery is achieved within the affected region – essentially an early form of repeated dose therapy or cyclic treatment for effective management and potential cure of pain originating from specific points on a body part. This translation maintains the original text's meaning that healing progresses through cycles (iteration) where each subsequent step in applying heat is taken as necessary until full resolution, guided by classical medical practice principles outlined within this medieval context.

Also place instruments for cauterization above those bone structures which are near your chest, two on each ankle joint, one additional instrument either at a specific ankle or foot region (presumably addressing swollen areas), and various numbers of them over the balls/joints where leprosy is present.

Regarding the treatment of fingers and similar parts that are called claws due to their appearance or cause when they become swollen from a deep infiltration (likely referring to conditions like gout), as indicated by these descriptions, two kinds of cautery should be applied: one on the forehead/face ("es foc") where pain is felt and another around the base of the tailbone or lower back area ("cauda"), holding hands possibly for therapeutic reasons (this interpretation takes some liberties as medieval texts may use symbolism differently than contemporary medicine).
May the focused (cauterizing) cautery be like fire that seems as painful as a wound being pierced by nail sharpness according to the quantity contained in the entire key of division into thin wedges; this is forged from iron following medieval medical practices.

Even though you have seen that the child' extraterritorial head was filled with water and its head remained constantly swollen within such a time it could not stand on itself due to the greatness of its head, and perhaps also because moisture increased inside where the breath dies.
This moisture is added between the navel and bone or is deposited on the chestbone, respectively:
When the operation in that case is moisture between bone and flesh and haemorrhage scarce, then you cut at the place of pain on top or under the chest to make a small fissure therein; this forms the seam.
And if the moisture increases and the ulcer becomes larger, here are two cracks according to this methodology:
If the humidity is in his nose, it indicates that your joints are open and water is squeezed out when you press on this area with your tongue at the parts where they have been divided, which signifies to you that there may be fluid accumulation or excess moisture.

When you have pushed the blood out of arteria, then you perform cauterization with two lances that you have sharpened for this purpose; place them at both locations to attempt drainage and suction, so that when they reach the bones, it causes stretching thereof, which makes sure that no further blood remains outside of these instruments.
This is how the cautery works:

When the humors are sharp and sour, it is within those veins above which the head rests that they cause no discomfort; sometimes even the skull seems to shudder as if walking on its own legs like ants, with these fluids exhausting them. At such times, physicians apply special treatments for this operation and refer their use by saying 'for passing,' suggesting movement or flow through a passageway within medicine's practice of caregiving—a delicate procedure involving the skull that resembles ant crawling on its own legs as it moves along. These ancient medical practitioners, masterful in their techniques for such interventions, consider this treatment indispensable to remedy these conditions brought forth by sharp and sour humors within body fluids—a testament not only of the complexity but also of the ingenuity inherent in historical medicinal practices.
When you command the malady to pull back the hairs that are in its forehead, and place them within three anterior gums according to the length of the forehead.

If there is a blockage in labor (referring perhaps to childbirth or another obstruction), then be ready for it; otherwise, administer its removal gently with just one small touch at most twice over.
And if there is not an opening (forgotten or neglected), then use an arsenic and wax-coated needle, insert the tip of it into the ulceration on the vein's side, sealing with the same material to ensure that only the needle protrudes without any further complications. When applying pressure above the belly button for firm attachment, pay attention as you have reported having had too much food consumed recently.
If there is no incision in this procedure, take hold of the lamp or device for illumination with which they press down on your thumb to apply pressure at the end of the range, and cover that area gently as it has been touched upon. Return that within the chest cavity for ease of breathing and remove moisture from the lung area.
Thus if there is not an opening in all the causes we have discussed so far, then you must create such an entrance to apply poultice or stop convulsion.

When in the patient's eyes, natural hair is adjusted slowly and old-fashionedly by ourselves (implying caregivers), causing illnesses accompanied with frequent tears and washing of eyelids/eye area which acts as a cause for damage to health when touched; cure consists of four methods:
And so that you stop the flow of bile in the liver, and if it converts (becomes red), turn your left hand over it; and if not converted, insert a needle into where the thread from parting has stuck down for a moment at the place on the eyelid above which hairs are located - this is within those same furthseeds. Pull back the filament (thread) to the parts of separation held by your right hand's fingers, and turn it into that very ray (line).
Return the eye lid fat to its position in the orbital bone within the major tear gland; and remove it from underne extrusion of skin or cloth threads quickly, place hands over the eyes as if holding a feather quill pen.
Mayhap when the figure corresponds to the quantity of eye elevation, these things are diversified among men; those who have a large amount inscribed in the eyelid for its softening proportion is their custom.

From this medieval medical text fragment provided, here's an attempt at line-by
To treat the condition that is found under the eyelid below (assuming "ehacrar" refers to a specific medical issue or treatment process and considering typical practices of medieval medicine):
When one blinks and contracts their eye muscles (whether right or left parted), due to weakening of the body's limbs or joint seals from tools like forceps or cauterizing instruments, it is called chalicia; this can be natural or accidental. It occurs because of limb consolidation or separation/disruption caused by these implements, as well as phantoms in their misery (i.dict the patient's torment).
May the reason for performing surgery on him be that you cut through his consolidation and separate his lips, pausing in there between them where they are covered by a cloth of yours, and bind those together once healed.
When using the healing tool for these causes that expel putrid matter which have never been able to dwell in their focus, constrict; even if you do so now.

This ligament in which you insert your tongue occasionally or naturally is where a person inherently does not speak (or perhaps has difficulty speaking due to their condition), and an insect that's already been crushed may accidentally cause injury, possibly exacerbating the issue with its involvement. The text appears to describe some form of therapedictive practice involving tongue movement within ligaments where speech is compromised by trauma or a pre-existing medical condition related
The operation is such that you crush the insect's mouth between your teeth (the existing part in one’dicting tongue movement), raise your own tongue, and insert it into this ligament according to a certain rule or technique—presumably meant for restoring some degree of speech capability. Here, there seems to be an attempt at using natural tools like the body's mouthparts along with direct action on affected tissues as part of treatment in medieval times. This line suggests that by following specific guidelines (latitude), one can possibly improve a patient’s ability to use their tongue despite speech difficulties caused either internally or externally, likely referring back to trauma involving insect bites within the context given.
If there is any tightness or knotting due to the insect's involvement, and it has formed as part of consolidation (perhaps an immune response), then you should apply pressure with one hand within the guidelines established for breaking into that ligament wherein speech impairment occurs. Here there is a direct instruction in medieval medical practice suggesting mechanical manipulation—using hands to press and possibly dissect or break apart any formed knots (nodules) as part of healing from an insect-related injury, again within the framework dictated by ancient physicians' understanding of treatment for speech difficulties related to such trauma.

When healed with the fluid we have discussed in our division, and you do not hinder your treatment, continue to apply pressure on it where necessary; even if directed towards that large round wound which has been added for a long time, its dark or black color suggests blood (sanguine), but is not from this location – then the fear of treating such internal bleeding originates here.
When you turn that second movement as dictated by the patient's pallor and length, make an incision in the malady area with the tool from which their form is processed, securing it partially within its new state; pull out that portion using one of two instruments detailed here for use at the site of these cuts.
When not inscribed that which is adjusted upon the patient' extrinsic part but rather what has been set above it; if you do so write about it may be permitted to speak of its properties and effects.
Returning into the wound, use of this fluid which we have applied within its cavity in two thighs, and take care for that which is healed inside it.
If the patient is frightened by his ignorance and fears during cauterization, that use of instruments causes acute water (bleeding), it'dict why you pause at the head where this fluid accumulates. Place your finger on their tongue with the instrument previously mentioned, and moisten said instrument in the distilled water used for cauterization; comforting as they feel when dampened by these liquids—do not let them become thick or subtle therein—and complete so that this takes shape:

Place a layer on top whereby if she dries up and falls off within three to four days.
If indigestion occurs while you practice medicine, then continue with that treatment and apply cauterization within the vine'dictorium at its entrance into the body cavity; cleanse this area where impurities are present in water, wash it thoroughly, treat externally with oil for embrocation, and insert a poultice to ensure healing.
This healing substance was put in with caution and placed for a long time out of fear.

Given that "Capitol" does not provide any text for translation in this context,
From the removal of thorns and the fluid that has attached itself to the joint, as well as other potential causes.
Movements persist in the groin or back of the thighs or any other cause.
Now that you have extracted what appears to be the cause from above where it has been observed upon sight, place your tongue on the tool at hand for further examination, thus making clear whether it is in the gout (gallstone).
When something does not appear and is hidden within the bowels, which makes you vomit the intestines when food has fermented in the stomach; or if indigestion causes an excess of gas from a slice of bread made with rye flour or roasted meat; or phlegm induced by sea sponge moistened with lemon juice, and this strongens quickly to fever (likely referring to dysentery), then once vomiting occurs: Here comes the first source sentence to translate:

Even though the patient'dicts their leg into it (the tool), due to his knowledge of the cause and its location, he gently draws out his hand holding the instrument as much as is prepared within him according to what has been readied for extraction herein.

So if you find a thorn in your foot, extract that small or subtle one carefully.
If it is not possible to extract from that, then take a concave canula and insert into the groin of the malady, placing a heated iron pin at the curve of the canula; allow such quantity (so long as the malignancy remains dead and stays within the groin) until daylight.
Here comes the translation:
May it not be forewarned that we have recommended this elixir, thus causing the fever in their abdomen or on their forehead with the same tool used in steam distillation of rue (assafide).
When it is necessary (it), then make points upon the surface of the foot with a pointed instrument (pointed cautery).
And when it is necessary (it), then perform an operation involving the intestine or hernia in which you grasp carbonized materials within an enclosure where there is a fistula; and place your hand underneath this procedure, holding their mouth at the end of the cannula. Bite down on your own teeth to ensure that sub-fumigation (a treatment method possibly involving smoke or heat) has reached its destination in the wound site—the sanguinous discharge indicates successful delivery thereof; after which it is time for action, as this patient will soon experience pain.
If not treated, then repeatedly perform the subfumigation movements, and prevent the humors from entering by abstaining from meat, salty foods, alcohol, and drinking water if necessary; thus making this regimen essential to follow.

Here again we're looking at philosophical or medical texts that could be discussing various means by which something (possibly referring to airbors) is introduced into the human body.

May some tools be provided that are not pierced but rather appropriate for the disease in those areas, where it complements their limbs.
So other such wounds that are torn when crossed and do not mature according to their complement, similar to those at joints where a wound occurs upon contact with the limb'pective area; or if it is from this member itself (i.dict primary), then piercing must be done within its ripening period in another body part – otherwise, should unripe flesh of that main organ have been punctured and lengthened into bite parts thereof, causing ulceration at the mouth end; or any such wound here present itself which has not yet healed up to this point. May you know the time of the puncture for the abscess and so it is when it ripens.
E observe when the pain gives way and fever subsides, apply reduction in speech and heartbeat, sharpening of the head post-abscess, and other signs as well.
When you know how deep to make an incision in the place where suppuration and discharge from treatment of swelling occur,
Through piercing into the length of the flesh or body, if awl points are in the parts of the mass or feet, and at locations where nerves cross (in tendons), and also on all difficult spots to reflect upon; there it is used according to each part.
When the suppuration is in the flesh, then we must open its incision until confirmed that digestion has taken place therein; but if you pierce it at this time, the patient's leg and groin are extended, and their lips become hardened, increasing depth.
When an ache must be pierced according to the flesh'dictum or due to what is necessary for that part of the body which it craves/needs, then do so accordingly.
When administering a small incision, and for large or wide incisions cuts according to the size of the wounds.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And among those applied tools where the cecum has been conquered and incised, when pain occurs with bread (suggesting hunger or digestive issues) and it intensifies like what you cause in diarrhea-inducing dropsy, apply them here.

From them in which it is administered, a round and moon-like medicine, appearing similar (to those).
May it not be possible for him who cannot stand with his apes on the surface, that which you pierce shall only penetrate superfdependently or flatly at most.
When the abscess is large and has collected pus already, do not attempt to extract all of it at once; take out some from that place today, properly treat the abscess within another day with a larger extraction, doing so gradually until completely cleared as per treatment progression.
Mostly if the malady is caused by excessive yellow phlegm or female emissions, or in a young child or an old decrepit person whose animal spirits are moving towards discharge from illness and they will die from the disease, then you perform operations on them.
1. Watch this subject with great caution, and place your instrument there where you pierce these lancets, so that you may avoid infections; consider then if the pus of the lancet is scant or a flat piece, thus administer to him whatever remedies olden or contemporary as fit his condition.
If in the abscess it has detached a part of the colon or that area is concave within the circuit, then you should bandage it tightly with linen cloth or waxed fabric as soon as possible after applying pressure pans or rags; and strengthen its position for three days to cure what comes out from inside while those abscesses heal.
If you have an excess flow of phlegm during your operation, then administer cold water and agree in the clothes where it accumulates frequently; apply that over the location of the retained mucus movements.
If the flow of blood persists, then ensure that you follow your regimen and care instructions carefully in places mentioned here within our book and division.
If it is wintertime and the location of the ulceration is a place where nerves are stressed, then cover them with crushed parchment or oil poured over as caulk, placing these upon those locations.
If it is summer and the locations are carnivorous, then when you pause pulpills at the beginning in water and oil (and perhaps wine), all this enters into your body until the fresh day as we have said before; furthermore, when you treat scabies and remove any residue from them within their treatment to aid healing.
So it is necessary that the knowledge of cauterization for wounds be universally known, perhaps as I have described in distinguishing between types of wounds to treat them individually at once.

This detailed directive appears to be related to a time-bound lunar phase for applying treatments—likely traditional medicine where the moon's phases held significance, and perhaps involves herbal remedies along with specific body adjustment practices as part of healthcare or self-maintenance routines during that period. The mentioning of "the crescent" suggests this could be related to a particular phase in which certain actions should take place for the treatment's efficacy, emphasizing synchronization between natural cycles and healing processes—a practice often found within various traditional medical systems across cultures through history up until modern times where such practices were

Based on the fragment provided and considering historical medical texts, it seems like you're referring to an old practice related perhaps to pestling or pinching of lice (from Latin
The line in question appears to describe an ancient remedy or procedure involving lice (from Latin: "Aquetz apostemas" meaning perhaps pediculosis). In this context, the text suggests that these parasites have made contact recently and are causing discomfort ("so de las specias"). The treatment mentioned seems to involve tough scales found in scabies

May you fear that we extract the thread (possibly referring to suturing or stitching), and if so, then immediately insert it into the head of this first needle lately used for cauterization at any part of the wound. Secure the threads in four places: here on the surface, there undernethyngs/belts (possibly referring to bandages or dressings), and elsewhere around body parts such as shoulders and chest where hands are held by them.

The eminence of the navel is painful due to movements causing fissures on its surface; or because of tears in a membrane that lies above these ruptures as they occur elsewhere, or from constriction (perhaps referring to conditions like ascariasis) when it flows downward along veins and arteries according to what has been mentioned herein.
May it be through the crack of the cisternal and by its thread that the appearance of suppuration is like the body'se skincolor; this swelling hurts as if a lion were causing pain in various situations. If it is due to the escape of the intestine (budel), then upon that day we have recounted what has come down from you about your state, which may greatly differ in intensity; and now when this situation occurs, return; for at such time he will be present there with us. And his magnificent display is seen as we introduce him to the bath (banh) vigorously washing away.

And if you consider the eminence of the navel to be caused by stones or veins, fear and apprehension should arise within you because that is where I taught in the Capitol about cauterization with iron and lancing for treatment.
If the prominency of the navel is due to either the intestine or the sling, then order that it retains its position and remain extended; also assign a guardian for all around the belly button area where you have applied pressure with your hand(s), instructing the abdomen's internal organs (belly) from between their respective limbs above. Furthermore, encompass these within the circuit of the navel located at the spot targeted by the aforementioned touch; encircle this area using the sling or belt across where hernia occurs and secure it with strong straps if necessary (belt). Additionally assign care to areas above where slippage might occur, ensuring everything stays in place.
Here comes the sentence to translate: And if you have touched or assaulted it by means of the inflamed membrane and inserted your fingers into that area, then extract and thrust the intestine towards the divided parts of the abdomen using the ligament; if you've done so through the ligament, remove carefully.

If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them into where they pierce the extended flesh and fall through themselves; when it subtly descends and is inserted there, ensure that this liquid which comes out of the wound helps heal the affected area.
If the navel's prominence is of fleshlessness or due to moisture in him/her, then you must cover it with bandages and extract dirt and humidity from there; this will remove the swelling present within them, and take care that which covers and consolidates their location.

Even though we have spoken about the species of rabies and how, in medicine, it is treated—care must be taken so that there are no ulcers; for rabies originates from a lesion (which could imply an injury or sore) where treatment should proceed with caution. It's important to handle such cases delicately as part of the medical care process when dealing with conditions potentially related to rabies, which often arises at sites of wounds that are not properly cared for.

Here

In the refinement and care of those who undergo circumcision (circumcision).
Circumcision is not a solution for continuation of diseases: however, when it comes from our operation and willpower, and in children, we must assign them to the better healing way with gentle suction.
So it is said that ancient ones did not practice circumcision among free men, nor do they use such practices in their laws today, only because we have acquired them through experimentation. This causes most of the craftsmen and barbers to abandon traditional circumcision and hygiene methods using new materials like metal clips and tweezers; instead, they now prefer leather thongs and forceps for pulling out hairs with nails.

This phrase describes a hernia as simply an accumulation of moisture in the "whitest part" (possibly referring to fat or abdominal wall) where intestine resides within and thus refers colloquially, often oversimplifying this condition. The term here for 'white' may be metaphorical rather than literal; it might denote something prone to visible changes like swelling when inflammation occurs (i.dictiomatically used as "whiten
Here are several observations where the pancreas (the organ in question) is located within its capsule and there's another substance already present; it’s not this but rather a protrusion or bulging that we discuss here, which implies inflammation – possibly an acute condition like appendicitis. The description then points out the location of concern: between the fat deposits (the 'whitest parts'), within where another substance—possibly pus in context with potential infection signaled by terms such as "cuyat" and implying urgency ("entro que sia cuyat") – has been mentioned, indicating an acute issue rather than a chronic one.
This line outlines the process of eliminating this hernia (the inflamed organ or protrusion), which involves draining and expelling substances from within—this could refer to pus, blood clots, etc.—from around the appendix into it ("afunduda aquesta materia"), indicating a potential acute surgical emergency like ruptured appendicitis. It also mentions that some of these fluids may be discharged through percussion (tapping), which is an old diagnostic technique used by doctors to listen for sounds from within the body, often
This moisture has motions of colors; whether it turns to lemon or cinnamthy red, black dregs, or watery white, that is what we observe here.

If the fluid is in the patient's pancreas, then inflammation occurs there and thus the doctor considers it another organ (probably referring to an adjacent structure or space).
If there is fluid between the navel and the umbilicus (belly button), then touch gently with your fingers on the center of gravity.

Then keep the double-pointed needle where it is faithful (steady), and thread one end through those parts in which you have pierced with a pin or thorn for drawing out impurities, inserting this other at their backs continuously as they work on them. This suggests an old medical procedure possibly involving lancets ('agulhe'/thorn) used to bleed and draw fluids from the body in order to purify it (perhaps a primitive form of bloodletting). Then insert them into the body at intervals of four sections according to their length—presumably referring to specific sites for therapeutic purposes like leeching, where bloodletting is done with leeches ('inscideys' could refer here either directly to medical instruments used in venesection or metaphorically to treatment methods) and withdraw what has been added by the accumulated foul humors (a reference possibly indicating a practice aimed at balancing body fluids, perhaps as part of an old remedy for conditions

Regarding the treatment of intestinal protrusion:
The appearance of this hernia is due to a section that extends over the abdomen from parts of the womb'dictum within it, through which if tendons are drawn towards those points of rupture in themselfs.
This rupture is either of the chest or due to exacerbation in that person, and you cause these pains by motions: beating, thrusting, coughing, rising from a heavy burden, or feigned illnesses.

When the patient' extricates through one of its segments (likely referring to movement or process), severe pain occurs suddenly; various symptoms appear on what seems like an apparent spine structure beforehand, and it is due to intestinal distension within the belly womb. Here "seccio del ciphac" might refer to a segment/stage of digestion (since 'cipa' resembles Latin for navel or umbilicus), while "aparent spine structure" could be referring to symptoms that mimic back pain, which in the context may relate to abdominal discomfort.
In some cases, the intestine is extruded through the opening of the sack (hernia), and this condition is called an enteric prolapse or hernia.

Here come locations suitable in water: therefore consider if the fetus is prepared to be placed on its head (or back), and ensure that you hold it with your hands holding its hair or chest (or collarbone), another hand under legs, a servant supporting shoulders or ears, or at any of these patient's designated areas such as the hips, waistbands, throat/palate, neck bone (cervical spine), hypochondrium.

Should it not be addressed that which has been recommended, keep in mind only what is directly related to the mother's mouth—if there are issues with this area (literally "should we ignore those recommendations provided?"), pay attention primarily to concerns about her/his condition around maternal oral care; however if they appear more than once and continue over several abstract considerations, cover that specifically by sealing it tightly along with four remedies—these will resolve the situation for a few days while removing dissatisfaction (literally "if these matters are repeatedly discussed without concrete resolutions"), then apply this combined treatment briefly to alleviate discomfort and gradually reestablish contentment. This statement implies that recurrent concerns or abstract debates about unresolved problems, particularly those related to maternal care around the mouth of a woman (possibly referring metaphorically in some aspects), should be directly addressed with specific interventions rather than getting lost in endless discussions; such direct actions are expected not only to provide immediate relief but also contribute toward achishifting back towards harmony and satisfaction.

If this person needs healing from the realm of simple medicines, take some warm water to bathe them in it; apply a poultice made with olive oil or without it according to practice herein described, and when bathing and using other stones as directed, anoint their sweat.
If the child is large, then administer stitching or clamp their lips together, and take care of it until healed within there (inside).
May it be that if there is depth or pain in the lower parts of the body massage-worked by others, then they pierce through where the gout has penetrated to relieve pressure.
May it be that in the patient there is an inserted artery and blood flow has been obtained, then separate or dry out/cauterize that which is necessary to provoke water into it.
May you have inserted the vertebrae of the lower back or all, and thus preserved the veins in the neck, so that when adjusting them on the spinal column without touching it; afterwards return those to their natural shape, tighten them with sutures along the spine'se length, leave for some days until healed. Take care of these points where fixation and excitement occur within which helps in healing.
If the child in their bone has pain before itching occurs, then I will strike that place; and if there are fragments of bone within them, remove all you can from those pieces; but if what is inside cannot be taken out with force, let water enter so that the child may detoxify internally, and they shall separate themselves along with their entrails being cleared away.
If the child is new recently, then grind over that powder which has been recommended for you. If in the patient there is an opening (fistula), then cure that which will remember to come back into its cavity within their skull.
If it is a lance or cudgel impact and sometimes depth is involved, and considering that the breech (patient's buttocks) may have been exposed to wind-borne dirt; consider that the clay/earth brought by these elements can be deadly. Here doctors understand that such contaminated earth or "clay" could pose a life-threatening risk when it enters the body through wounds, especially in areas where patients have been lying down (probably referring to their lower bodies).
If there is no depth and the slime has recently been in his body, then you pause him for the first hour after morning dew moisture, without tightening so that he does not retain within the depth of it and return to the heart, perhaps pausing with linen attracted (i.dict a compress), lifting those areas guided by previous indications throughout the day.
If the ointment is not at your disposal, then rest in the room where water collected on the ground to prevent moisture that causes humidity; and make sure gout remains above this area because it's adjusted there for its flow of fluid.
Might three days pass without the patient suffering from cramps or spasms in their belly, nor convulsions of a bad spirit inside them, and if so, use other good means available to you; then care for that as well as any further cures within which they can be healed.
If healing of the patient is delayed and it has been long time already for recovery, then you know that a fistula (abscess) has formed; therefore, take care of this through your wisdom as a physician.
If the swelling is due to a rupture or tearing of space or skin, and it's simple on the surface of the thigh or chest, then treat that area with water (if large) used for suturing, or powder if small.
May there be pain in the bone already, and their teeth are loose as well; if they have been separated from each other, use forceps to extract those teeth. If they are not separated, then let them be led out that the vermin may be removed from their bodies.

When two other stitches communicate with each other, they may do so more or less within the abdominal stitch itself.
Yeah recommends that you each have your own examination and declaration.
So when the child is small and suffers from any cause of hernia for that reason, it becomes difficult to reduce; either because of its diminutive size due to disruption as we have mentioned beforehand, or when the hernia swells up due to cold air.
And when the fluid is rising upwards alone or with a towel dipped in water squeezing it out gently (or submerging and wringing), alongside onions, cloves, and liniments applied within where inflammation should be resolved.
And when water has been applied in such a way that it provides relief, and is better than the application of pure water alone for dissolving inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in the water where it has been elevated with vinegar and garlic, which helps to remove its cause from within briefly.
If the interior is spared from this treatment, then divide the rupture into small pieces using an instrument on which pins have been placed.

From the tool, its form is as follows:
One sharp turn of the limb, and another not sharp, as well as the delicate end which is not like the subtlety of bone - both are blunt at one point.
And when the patient'thy condition is aggravated and the intestine protrudes out of its cavity, then make sure to reduce it back to its natural form within itself if possible in this place; for better health will be achieved as a result.
When the disruption is wide and occurs in the lower abdomen, where you lay down the hernia on their back, placing cushions under them, while holding their head; if it' extruded below the navel, then hold their head as well with a pillow or some props that they have placed themselves.
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English line by line:
When it is necessary that water be applied on large wounds and for bleeding, then do so accordingly.
In small pains, pause what you have prepared for it, and make that servant to be between your two palms held in hand, which contains the entire disruption at its middle point here below, adjusting the lips of yours as necessary according to where any stitch has been placed by yourself or another.
Here is the line-by extralinear translation:
Return the strength of both feet in the circuit of the arrow, and some manipulations with joints are done, adding bruises on lips and skin for better aggregation; lay down the bulkiness of that area and insert another needle into it, holding this second needle as well together with the first one used earlier. No matter how necessary to continue inserting needles until completing all issues related to intestinal protrusion.
When fine needles move between inflammation and subtlety, where the small ones enter into flesh; and the large are difficult in the spine, thus they must pass through delicacy and size.
Even where the needle is fixed in any of the body's extremities provided for it, so that the flesh does not tear apart and worm-like creatures do not burrow within its foundation.
And they are not stitched up so that the patient is not prevented from healing.
Here comes the sentence for translation: Ensure you insert your fingers into the holes of all sewn parts, which are held by the tips of the needles; and place them there until you realize that the flesh has healed.
These sewing needles are inserted into the small wounds with careful use of a sharp instrument or two fingers, which is enough for their suture.

May you direct two kinds of sewing according to what is narrated by Parayllus.
When you begin with stitching of the navel and insert the needle from the lower portion into the upper portion,
And when the needle enters into the navel and also in that portion of the body where you previously inserted it, making short and long penetrations throughout all parts of the body, place the point where the needle was introduced at the other end' extruding part; make the needle enter this extreme side as well.
When you have caused that entry herein, then make another entrance in those portions of the body where it was before absent and return to them; let the cavity which is there now be opened again by your hand and insert the needle into its other extremity at this place.
When fluid (perhaps blood or pus) is entering the cistern through that portal where it enters, and this happens in the extreme end of which he's already inside there, everything flows into that space together within him.
Here begins with the side of this patient and takes that one to their extremity, where it is pierced by a needle from the cleft (of the buttocks), which then returns in place within that same opening therefrom; as does another similar piece inserted at its base.

The sum total of this suture maneuver is that you sew the skin with a thread used for mending hairs, so as to make stitching along the extremity part of the coda (tailbone), and leave it until after completion.
May the second type of suture proper to this art and recommended by it is that you sew up such half-strength material as they themselves use for sewing; applying its extremity with another piece from here, and attaching their chest part therewith in a way natural to them. Do so when instructed by the master'thy teachings.
When you keep the needle at your side, and push it into that part of departure from birthplace as far as possible in that place, and turn over (or rotate) the needle to make penetration through two points on the chest; now adjust the position of the needle again.
When you turn those bones, and let the chill humors enter into one another' extramundarily from their cavity in either of its two limbs simultaneously (this refers to turning or manipulating the joints).
This stitching is better than ordinary simple sewing, and it's this one from which memory recalls.
This is the speech of Guilielmus (or Gil in English)
Even if the thread of their stomach has been sewn together with two needles so that you can insert your fingers into these, and begin inserting the other needle accordingly to those threads which have been cut along their chest where they are joined by hand (surgical suture), then proceed as follows:
When you understand that a disturbance occurs in the belly'm area (abdomen), it is more difficult to close its stitches than those of other parts of the abdomen.
May the art of medicine for common diseases be judged by other illnesses.
The cause is when you continue the treatment of recent excrement in their sanctum downstream where air alters that which and return the intestine and hernia to its cavity, so your hand rests over that fleshly covering, thus preventing it from coming out.
If the air has altered the humors and causes them to flow in that manner within you, where they become hardened and create fields around these areas; care for it as if curing other illnesses inside of which such purulent matter is found solidified into pus. Here we have a description related to treating abscessed or infected conditions by manipulating the body'dictions (humors) through various means, suggesting an approach consistent with humoral theory prevalent in medieval medicine where balance among bodily fluids was considered essential for health:
Might you not have the medicines with you now, then rest on that which is most immediately at hand; allow it to begin healing for today and tomorrow as long as you are accompanied by me in learning, until such time as health returns, after which you will no longer need other medical remedies when simple pains subside.
If you fear that the vermin may cause injury to the main body parts, then submerge wool in warm or rotten oil, and keep it there while placing your hands between the joint angles where dislocations can occur.

Remember when you have infection inside the intestine.

Summaries and collections from the essence of bone fracture, which are required before we begin to recall the details of each broken bone and its various parts (Note: This translation is an approximation as it attempts to convey a medical text related to treating or understanding skeletal injuries. The original Latin sentences appear complex due to their structure but aimed at summarizing necessary actions for handling fractures). Cover then, in the introduction of this chapter, we present the essence of our speech; and these chapters are understood by craftsmen and skilled workers who stand upon knowledge and truth about such arts beyond their own. Here it means that initially, within a specific section or introductthy at the start of the book (chapter), key ideas will be shared for readers to understand better—especially targeting those with practical experience in related fields._
And so it is said that when you experience a bone fracture or dislocation or twisting injury, then take care of yourself with an incision if no cause prevents this, to treat wounds as needed, whether the injury itself inflicts pain (fracture/dislocation), makes one weakened and decrepit, or occurs during intense cold or heat.

May it be that when the bones are not yet restored to health since they were injured and until their natural curvature is healed—according to what we doctors practice, a grave mistake in our operations; moreover if water has expanded freely and strengthened them (the joints), then it would greatly increase their size.
Yet they have not seen enough of it from among their peers, so it is reasonable that they do not apply it themselves.
Second part (Capitol secundus): When a bone breaks in the head.
The spices of breaks are pains and their figures are various, the causes are distinct: from any break one might feel pain due to impact on an aperture, which allows said pressure into the cranium (the skull), thus entering inside it; when there is also an incision in the space that includes part of the bone, you cut through the flesh and this does not pass beyond the back of the head. This type of break spice is called "lifted absolute.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
This fracture or that which has already penetrated the periosteum (the layer surrounding bone), either within the bone itself or on its surface; in these cases, it is either large or small.

These issues do not lead to healing on themselves.
If you witness an uncontrolled event (accident or misfortune), then you begin healing the patient.
When the cause is that evil has entered your body through meals during rainy days of the twelfthy day in its entire arrangement within the bone structure, then take care as you study it from below the knee throughout the duration of this twenty-fourth day.
If it is in the summer days, when you press your knees against each other during the day, they may have their pancreas rotten due to moisture accumulation and suffer from complications as recommended.
If the fracture has already reached the brain covering (the pia mater), and it consists of small fragments and friable matter, then cover with fine particles as recommended by you.
When you lift the patient' extruded hump (which may indicate hernia or edema), and examine over their bones as per usual practice according to what is observed in a child, so that they become aware of it outside the body.
If you painfully detect the bone, apply sanction or purifying cauterization immediately and stand beside it with water that covers, to allow rest for the inflamed area, ensuring security against fluid discharge of pus; begin treatment at the site of injury and incisions.
And it is either one of two methods for operation.
One of the maneuvers is that you insert one instrument into each other so deeply as to touch them with their sharp ends. This is how it should be done: Insert another similar but smaller implement for this purpose, and similarly here too; this also forms part of the technique.
When appropriate medicine is applied with forceps that have just been cleaned for use as the second instrument,

If there is any part of the bones that are small and tender, take those which will make it easier for you to remove them from the joints; also care for these pins and waxes (used in treatments) as needed.
The other aspect of the operation is faint-hearted and out of fear, which Gualia and Laze work for great praise; this is their speech. It's necessary for you in your attendance to discover where the bone fracture was forcefully placed and made evident, stopping momentarily upon finding that specific part with a slow and cheerful movement typical of these individuals:

Capitol III. (The Roman numeral "III." signifies
When your nose is broken and cracked open, here's how to handle it:
You understand that it is not broken from the nose but cut into pieces placed together side by sides, some of which are made according to cartilaginous bones; these parts do not break and become crooked or twisted inwardly nor fracture within you due only to arrogance and tortuosity.
If one of the bones breaks and you insert a small object into its nose (presumably as an impromptthy makeshift splint), secure it tightly with what is indicated by your hand, until back in place following its natural shape. If it is fluid for your ease and make sure you do not harm the groin area during that operation of yours on their thighs.
If the fracture is in the upper chest portion of the body and does not go to that place, then cover it with a large piece from where the bone ends or splintered off at this joint.
If the bone is broken into parts, then you make it seem like this (referring back to something previously mentioned in context).
When the bruise is restored on the first day of injury, if possible; otherwise, apply the seventh or octave rest periods for recovery from the application of caustic measures.
Return the instrument into the extremity of the nose a cloth from him, if the break is in one piece, or metal nails for breaks in bones, and such heavy weight that it doubles the displacement of the nose.
Here comes the medieval medical treatise for translation:
Here are the translations line by line:
This cause is not necessary for you; if you wish, then perform this action, and if desired furthermore apply cold compressions.
If you apply a caustic poultice externally with charcoal or linseed paste mixed in oil and vinegar, or with lime juice (medically known as "diaquinol"), do so carefully to treat an open wound.
If you have not yet treated the abscess with caution, then heat that part of it which is affected by barley flour and honey paste applied to almond powder; place your hand over its stop (the swelling), ensuring there'thy no cause for pain.
May if the bones of the nose are broken or compressed, break them over those areas and extract with instruments that you find appropriate for these; fix the fracture using fluid (blood) that embodies it and strengthens it, as well as bandages suitable to its treatment.
If you crush worms inside the nose, then treat it with that which heals and apply bronze tubes within so that his whole body may be restored to health.

If the jawbone has already been broken into pieces, then it is necessary to administer extension of parts according to proper alignment so that healing can occur.
If you have caused concussion to the teeth and intend that they break apart due to mercury or silver (or gold), then apply pressure on the broken jawbone fragment, and place your hand over the double cloth drape; also place a single-handed pillow along the length of the jaw fragment.

And when that bandage is put on and adjusted over it, so as not to alter the position of the bone, let such be done only if healing occurs strong and complete; for this fracture will mend in three weeks' time.
If another complaint of purulent inflammation occurs, apply the treatment we have mentioned for these previous pains inside until it is healed and this abscess (aposteme) has disappeared.
If the fracture is in bone (plagua refers to a young or immature state, which can imply broken due to weakness), consider whether it'thy displaced from its position within the osseous structure of that body part or if separated/dislocated. Then carefully reposition those dislodged parts back into their original place in accordance with what seems appropriate for restoration during recovery (remocio).
If the poultice applied is insufficient, then increase it according to your need at the foot surgery site.

In English, this phrase related to the treatment of a broken arm would translate roughly as: "Treatment for the
When translating this medieval medical text concerning the treatment of a broken arm (which I've interpreted to be in Old Occitan based on language use), we get:
When either the great or small fire is broken only once, and thus their joints are injured (injured due to bone fracture),
When the small fire below is broken, then restoration and healing of him will be easier (safer/more likely).
When the fire of it breaks down at times, its bone is bad, and healing for it becomes difficult.
When that thorn from it came when they were broken into two pieces.
Then if the bone that has been broken is the little under-hand one (likely referring to a small or minor fracture in the hand), it's convenient for the doctor, and you need its restoration which will be done quickly until this moment when said person can use their hands again.

If you harden the plaster cast applied to your restoration, then take waxed linen strips dipped in olive oil and white wax, respectively, weave them between stiffness and subtlety; drape it over that area where the sprain is tightened until the splint gives way. Then remove the wax and apply a poultice made of powdered flower from chamomile boiled in honey mixed with crushed chalk, place pressure on this point above which there was placed afterward due to fracture; here lies that stone stopped by placing it where broken bone has been set.

And when you apply pressure firmly on the location of the fracture and also release it vigorously, if afterward the constriction moves beyond the parts above or below the fractured bone segments, then loosen the tightness gradually as soon as its remembrance in your conscious mind occurs during meditation. Here 'pausa la strictura' means to relieve or release the tightness/constriction; 'le loc de la fractura pus fort e pus vehement' indicates strong and forceful pressure applied on the site of the break, suggesting immediate aftercare for a fresh injury might be expected in this context. Moreover, ‘mays sira’ could translate to perhaps or may even loosen which suggests uncertainty about how much constriction movement is normal post-injury; 'partidas desus de la fractura' refers to the parts above (probably indicating bones that
And the bandages that cover the fracture are soft and not hard or constricting; this particular fabric is what you should choose to move between fine (light) texture as advised by our healers/doctors, suggesting a preference for softer materials in wound dressings which aligns with traditional holistic approaches of gentle care.

May it be that the bruise is in the parts of defeat and appears as cloth drape, and order the patient to tighten (or strengthen) this area with their hand on its bruised part; make sure the bandage/cloth wrap long enough.
And if it is necessary for the body (the corpus) to be wrapped in cloth whereby it rests on the palm of the hand, then tightly bind that second layer around it so that the body remains supported by the hands.
May it be that if the fracture is at the exterior parts, then you should pause below and above stone fragments of the part affected immediately after touching them with your hand so that the wound becomes covered (protected) and healed quickly; also apply pressure to stop the swelling until when you have turned over its position between the muscles as directed.
If you break the bones of your fingers, and it' extruded from its place (fracture), then apply pressure on top of them with a small stone held in your palm; if you wish to do so: pause for three days until the fracture is raised and not swollen.

Whenever necessary, extend the minister (doctor) fully according to the quality of bone where the fracture is located in the bone.
If it is necessary for the ligament to be close to the bone at the joint' extrinsic boundary, place it on the tendon of the limb, and thus prevent extension in those areas; while another bandage also comes immediately after the fracture.
If the joint is predisposed to inflammation, then it will have pain and swelling in the parts just mentioned.
Here the doctor enwraps one of their own limbs inside until it is reduced according to its natural shape and normal joint connection; as long as there are contractures or shortening present that do not affect the affected member (patient). May you if there is an ulceration present, then apply that for several days until the ulcer heals itself, and return to your care routine.

And in some cases this pelvic fracture is also accompanied by spasms which occur alongside the splints we have discussed earlier in our assistance with the arm.
Even in the process of restoration like this, you will not cure the locked thigh movement; and if it is restored alone, another should be applied on top as well, making it necessary for them to limp that very leg which has been subjected to heat or cold.

The provided text appears as an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise that mixes elements
From the breakdown of the heel (talus) and the bones of the foot, as well as those of the toes ("dits").
Although the foot does not break entirely; some breaks may occur in the leg bones; and to the fingers of the foot few cracks are broken therein, but rather dislocation within their joints.
If the bones of the foot have been broken and sometimes those bones are raised above them among themselves, then let loose their thighs on the ground prepared for burial with a corpse.
Return the leg over that which is raised from those bones, and apply heat to them; press and massage these limbs until they return to their proper places.
Returned pressure and bandaging above (or on top of), and placed a small table in the abdomen where two covers are attached.
Return strength to that which is lacking in the limb' extraneous conditions and you have wrapped it with cloths as well; these are what induce poor health according to doctors (or cause weakness).
When three or four days have passed, then unlace the bandage, and you will find that the bones are either fractured or dislocated; in those cases, operations must be carried out with instruments made of brass.
If your armpits are swolthy and painful, restore them as you will, applying oil and massage on these areas for their healing restoration. Here the translation of each line into English would be as follows:
If you have cracked the bones of either two or three joints (or more), then pause on any part of each enclosed limb covered by a lion' extradition robe, and stretch the table in the lower back of the body so that its tongue can remain good.

At the location where you have fractured bone (when broken), especially if it's large or impactful, similarly to that of your hip or adjacent structures, and which closely resembles how they are connected in yourself; then most likely at this very site you should be immobilized immediately with a splint. This is particularly true when the conditions for performing such an intervention (fracture management) align well as per those who have expertise similar to yours or medical professionals capable of taking care of such injuries, according to your current circumstances and needs.
If the patient'thy body is flushed with heat, then you should cover them tightly to cool it down if there isn't another cause for this condition.
When it is time to begin healing the fracture on that day, do not extend beyond today unless gangrene sets in.
May you soothe the ulcer with warmth; do this within one day since that is when it will give in and not on the third day from now, for then bad accidents may occur.
If the bone is broken above the neck of discovery, then when you perform reduction efforts to reduce that and immobilize it with your hands will make those tasks easier and require little extension effort from yourself.

When the bone heals after setting and elevation of tortuosity/protrusion in a limb and its bonding, it is guarded against form misfortess; yet your body part may not be forbidden from natural movement, except that which signifies this member was new to fracture. (The translation here indicates medical advice for care post-fracture healing: the injured area should maintain proper alignment and support but still allow some normal function of the limb unless it is a fresh injury.)
Mays and so stand against the misguided practices of our doctors, which this healing procedure is ruinous in such fear for death's door; these actions lead to one’thy potential demise. (This translation suggests criticism towards what may be considered outdated or dangerous medical treatments that carry a significant risk of fatality.)
May if immobilization and binding are recent (i.e., fresh), cover them in a cloth bathed in water where the healing balm is applied, mixed with aloe vera juice or honey for soothing properties; they resemble plant-based remedies known as 'daemens consolidacii.' Or else if these are fatty poultices and smeared on women's breasts to facilitate healing (using olive oil, linseed), apply them likewise. Here the immobilization with bandages or cloth is mentioned along with specific preparations for wound care that were believed beneficial at this time in history:
Some parts are made wet by persistent cold breeze that is in the upper airs and should be administered movements of the body throughout all hours of the day.
May if tortuousity arises recently and it becomes a hardened stone causing necessity for its removal by iron hook pin prying out the patient's discharging pus from below the cecum, continuously dissolving bone fragments resulting in excess fluid accumulation due to that of this specific physician’thy intervention.

Of displacement in speech (This translation assumes that "dislocacio" refers metapthyically
Of displacement in any of the joints of one's body, it is forbidden to move and a limb-figure (or arm/leg) injury becomes necessary; this causes pain throughout the abdomen area and severe aches.

The text provided appears to be in Catalan (or related dialects), and it describes three ways by which a muscle may become dislocated: one is the initial event, where something interferes with movement at or near its origin ("la partida del titillic"), causing an injury. The second way mentioned involves immediate aftermath of impact when forceful action occurs right before restoration takes place (as suggested by "a la partida dejos"). However, without the full context and
The translation continues in Catalan and it explains that the second way of muscle dislocation is when something hinders movement below (implied by "desus") the affected area, requiring intervention ("fayt tart"). It clarifies this form specifically excludes occurrences behind or due to nerve issues. This provides a description of specific circumstances under which spinal manipulation might be used and indicates that dislocation here is not caused posteriorly (behind) by problems with the shoulder joints nor anteriorly/medially from nervous system complications, but rather possibly involving misalignments or pressure points below (
The text further describes that most muscle dislocations occur immediately after trauma ("e defora eyssit a las partidas dejos"), often involving areas where the nerves are thin or small (which could contribute to vulnerability). In some cases, notably in those with existing conditions like carpals swelling and inflammation can complicate dislocations. The passage suggests that such situations may require immediate attention ("mays en les quísmes") due to the potential complexity of treatment required when muscle displacement occurs alongside other issues related to bone movement or nerve involvement, possibly hinting at a more intricate medical assessment and intervention strategy needed for these cases. This detailed exposition underscribes both preventive aspects (avoidance around
And with the cold applied by pressing or massaging (percussion or cautery), and their muscles are set down due to atrophy, they are jerked because they have already been dislocated.

From this dislocation it is felt a light reduction when cool and the malady inflates into its cavity.
The reduction of the patient is for the minister to raise their mass above them (to elevate and suspend it over them); place gentle pushes on the swelling joints intermittently, strengthening its juncture in its position there, and with this action, after some time, they return gently.
If it does not return, and because that dislocation occurs over days, then the swelling of the limp is submerged in tailwater (likely meaning a specific type of fluid used for medicinal purposes), administered with black cumin oil to soften and line up the joints, along with fenugreek and coriander in water; this concoction should also be given.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish to perform this second maneuver: make present a long home that is from the waist and belongs to it, insert your muscle quickly into the space of the hernia as soon as possible, while another servant pulls out the mass from within its divisions immediately after being inserted by yourself. If the thigh is loose (suggesting a hernia or weakness in that area), then place your hand there because another cause of it being displaced will occur; when this happens quickly return to normal position as much as possible before dislocation occurs again.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another method of treatment is as follows: make a long staff with which shape will be given; it should not be thick nor subtle and have its rest on the patient's buttocks, just like a mortar ball—and keep it there immediately. Place the support undernegyon (buttocks), so that maladye remains along the length of the staff, with firmness placed over headsyng (bottom) of said staff; extend its application evenly to all parts instantly whereby junctures return quickly back to their proper location due to swift action.
If reduction of it is difficult for all the reasons previously mentioned, then use this treatment: grasp a stick with the length that reaches up to two arm'se lengths above you and its tilting angle should be four times as long from where your thumb meets your little finger. The weight at the top (usually made of lead) will settle into the pelvis according to this arrangement:
Ensure that the hat rests on his head, in such a way that it does not push upwards against the waistband (of the patient's clothing).

When the patient's internal organ is completed according to any possible way you can achieve it and then cease briefly their titillic spera of wool with a quantity as needed; apply an emplastrum prepared from molten lead mixed with egg whites over all muscle, so that they may be turned upwards above the stricture site, and bind this bandage to the patient's chest where it is attached, ensuring its cleanlinency for seven days without becoming moist.
When the food of the malady is scarce and has been restrained (or paused), thus allowing the body part to be comforted, then it will heal itself.
And when food is given in greater amounts and the body performs some movement, if it does not close and soften, then already it begins to heal.
If the joint is dislocated due to humidity that you have or for some other reason, then in that case three kinds of cautery are administered as stated in the treatise on cauteries.
If all this pain is present and the ligament or joint has not been closed for seven days, then the bandage and swelling are reduced in some measures here on it; moreover, as you know that their nerves lie within the muscle (at its head), which may be contracted or softened/mollified—and you understand that the joint will never remain fixed at this place.
When joint pain is caused by the dislocation of that which you feel in your knee and chest or other body parts, reduction (returning to position) occurs through pushing and stretching until it returns.
And if it is necessary for treatment in that area of other constriction, care will be given while healing takes place therein.
If you harden the body' extrication in their limb and slow down its movement, then have mercy on them with regular baths until that gravity is alleviated and they return to their original state of nature.

When the hip joint is dislocated and seems difficult; it's dislocated in all parts mostly at the part behind (the gluteus medius), which isn'thy when I adjust its position after manipulation or touch as per any form of displacement, then you have manifestly declared that the juncture has become concaved and cannot bend your arm nor touch it where said muscle is.
When the hips are affected (or have contracted), reduce it so much that you return to its original position of setting in cauterization; if there is already an apostema set in place, difficult will be reduction and cannot heal completely from all aspects – especially when they occur behind, where malacias derived entirely from other components of dislocation come with continuous painful urges towards that area.
When the restoration of it is possible, which means that its body part must be extended with hands and arms outstretched, while doctors stand on their hips/knees and push downward at the joints in their palms or between the thumbs (where they hold their tools), to return them back into position.
If the dislocation is at the joints ahead of time, then return it so that your hand presses against its own position inside while making contact with the groove on the backside of its palm.
If dislocation does not obey reduction, then apply vigorous extension and strong motion.

And so if the joint is formed in that place, there you will cut through it and apply that thing to it.
If you see the joint not strained, then apply the plaster and bandage repeatedly until it is brought out again; also return that which has come out during these days.
If you apply pressure to the reduction of the joint and its position is in motion, then administer moisture with warmth gently but firmly until it relaxes; when this occurs at the fatty muscle hernia site, secure it therein (with binding) and place that over the bones during daytime and night. Return that which is retained there (the swelling or accumulation), and immerse it in the bath; when discharged, rub on the joint where heat has begun to arise quickly upon movement, doing so repeatedly for relief—these are days one, two, and three. Intramedically (or within), where it enters/enters into its layer (the mentioned organ).

When any of the vertebrae in the back or neck are dislocated completely and there is movement at those points which cannot be treated here (implying that immediate medical intervention elsewhere may not always be possible), then death results from blood loss into the abdomen ("the upper region"). The translation suggests a severe spinal injury with potential life-threatening consequences, possibly indicating limited treatment options and urgent need for advanced care to prevent fatal outcomes.
It is said that the discharge of blood from within (possibly referring to internal bleeding or hemorrhage) goes beyond one's control and cannot be stopped; consequently, softening occurs in either their limbs or both legs—a condition indicating profound weakness. Additionally, a vertebra may prolapse here, resulting again where movements exacerbate the injury (indicating that even gentle motions are harmful) until such time as these actions cease and become restorative measures for treatment: divided into four parts or stages of medical care required to address this serious condition.
Thus, it is swolthy at the back parts and there's no healing lubrication.

When wrapped over the head of the patient's thigh and tightly fastened with strong bands, extend the limb part up to where it meets the head; secure that band here, then apply another band on the legs attached by their cushions (probably referring to leg supports or splints), attach these as well. Finally, adjust all straps and bind them together in the other staff which holds the patient'se feet.

Of hock joint dislocation care.
You understand that the joint between the thigh and the muscle is not dissolved merely by itself but only so much, and you do not injure those same humors in other smaller recessions of body cavities.
E the wide joint is dislocated according to four ways, it can be dislocated at the divisions of the legs (partes dentises), or below the divisions of the legs (parte deforezas), or in front of the divisions of the legs (parte dantas), or behind the divisions of the legs (parte detras).
Mostly these joints are out of place, and rarely in front or behind them.

The translation of this medieval medical treatise line by line into English would be as follows:
When the name of that individual is dislocated from between his parts as he extends further with the cushion undernethy, and if it continues to force itself towards these areas where movement cannot occur; its urine becomes retained therein, and the swelling within him has an apoplectic spot applied upon it. And you must walk on their foot above this area of tendon (heel).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and indeed if the dislocation is old and ancient, as has already been done by the treatment you administer here, it's not entirely in that cure; hence there won't be a prospectus. And so now we proceed with:
May occur in the place where dislocation is recent, and it belongs to one of the four species of dislocation; there you should catch what has come out (the joint), return it (to its position) and extend that joint both upwards towards the upper body parts and downwards towards the lower body parts. Rightly turn back (dislocate it correctly); this does not require other treatments from additional care.
May it be that if the patient does not return in this manner, then you must prepare strong medicine and extend the cushion from where they were placed quickly or slowly (or apply ointment on top of said removed area), while another attendant extends such medication above them; furthermore, tighten a leather strap over their lower back part covered by cloth, with one servant holding their hands.
When it extends from here or where the bone ends at the shoulder joint, or below this point of the sternum and breastbone,
When all of them are extended within a period while the hump is lifted up and falls down,
This specific type of extension occurs in all four parts as well.
And if the displacement returns due to water we have discussed, do as you wish for it; otherwise, it is necessary throughout all special waters that must be spoken of regarding its own treatment.
In the patient's reduction, when dislocated and displaced to their joints, so that the hump is placed on its back side; and pause the ligaments at the knee area where they are between the head of the thigh and the place where it protrudes outwards during labor; and extend them along the part of the shoulder connected with either end of the collarbone.
And another minister with great force beats the limbs of him, and presses firmly on the hollow of the thighs to extend them violently; whereupon that place returns to its original position.
This specific substance is for purulent care of which this limb has been reduced, and other such are used with it to treat the same condition as well.
May it be that you are at rest on us and do not resist this special form of healing care; for the two feet of the thigh we bound together with strong thread, rope, both legs, and both lower limbs hold our hands.
Whenever any part of a person' extruded length is equal to four digits and the size of their groin extends more than two digits, it implies that there may be an issue with body humors or excessive fluid accumulation.

Each minister extends to his/her portion, and the doctor uses her hand for reduction according to the art.
When dislocation is at the joints below, it is then necessary to stretch out this cushion and as for that treatment described by our medicine master; let the doctor's palm of his right hand rest on the lower thigh bone, while he presses with the other palm upon that contraction area, pausing there until the extended cushion reaches down to the joint below.
If dislocation is at the joints behind (behind), they do not cover where the malady has extended to the parts backward; having a place covered over what causes hardship, when part of it in front becomes dislocated from these areas, according to what we have said about its appearance on two broad sections—there should be no pain.
When compression is applied with a table over the location where pain occurs at the joint,
So once the reduction is complete as commanded — and do not call it "the pulling of lu" by you, for that's your task to extend from below (from the hips), placing cushions there, another servant on their legs, and one on their chest, holding their hands.
Return the ligaments and bandage back into place, comparing one cushion with another.
When you see those knots in the womb (uterus), you understand that the displacement is already fixed, and thus let the uterus return.
If you see any cause of suppuration (indicating inflammation or infection), return and bandage that area according to your first treatment method, and apply it again for three days.
And apply that one there, and let it take time in walking on these for several days until they are comfortable.

And when the dislocation returns and it is declared to you that reduction has been restored, then apply firm pressure with an ointment or salve on that area, and bind the foot to the cushion tightly.
Where you fear or protect the nerves that are behind your ankle, to prevent the ligament from being violent and leading astray:
Return that item for two or three days and if it is made softer by the ligature, extend that as well.
Return that particular in the day or at night for forty days and prevent you from indulging excessively (in food). If you forcefully go into that space, it is not certain that the detachment will not be on a decayed and corrupted area, nor will it receive treatment carelessly.
If you apply a caustic on him/her/them there (the patient), make sure to administer it in the place where we previously mentioned this treatment and recovery process will continue herein until healing occurs fully.
The provided text appears to be instructions from an old medical perspective possibly related to treatment of joint pain
Regarding the setting in place (repositioning) of displaced bones, particularly those within the feet: It is necessary for proper care and
When someone has a displaced bone that needs to be set back in place: It is necessary for them to lie with limited extension of their three limbs (arms and legs); if it's not difficult, use gentle forceful movements herewith referred as "ligatures".
If the dislocation is in one of the bones above the knee (hips), then to set it back into position: One must place moisture on the muscle and skin over that joint area either directly upon earth or a tabletop; keep them as they were while lying down. This implies immobilizing both body parts for healing, similar in intent but not necessarily mirroring modern practices of splinting with materials like fiberglass casts.
Maintain the position of your body weight downwards and apply pressure on those parts over which you have identified joints; additionally cover that area with some form of padding or cushion, ensdict as necessary where it enters inside (probably referring to a limb within an exoskeleton-like device) for return. Then observe if the person's leg now remains correctly positioned and has not reappeared in its elevated state above normal resting level: This statement suggests monitoring after setting procedures, ensuring immobility where required – likely indicative of early practices involving manual adjustment or physical supports to manage dislocations. The translation seeks the essence but may diverge from current medical understanding

And when the limb returns as we wish it to do so quickly, administer the regimen that prevents an abscess and heals what is needed according to our lubricants (ointments or medications).

And if you dislocate a bone and cause it to break the articulated parts apart, perform their restitution back into position (setting), using materials for simple dressings previously mentioned in those locations of injury; this is an immediate course of action needed after such incidents. The term 'malauxis' here refers specifically to injuries or wounds that require cleaning with the already described substances ("accideys en le os satagias" – breaking a bone into parts).
Watch and avoid according to your will that which is inside the body through those channels of fear as I have previously instructed you; this is better for you than what comes from any creator, potentially referring not only to one’s own health but also spiritual or ethical choices in life. This line can be interpreted metaphorically with "intrament" suggesting something internal and possibly harmful ("temor"), while the advice appears as a call towards self-discipline over fear (fear of consequences). The phrase suggests that taking control rather than relying on external forces, which could include supernatural or divine entities referenced by “Creator,” aligns with one's long-term wellbeing ("gloria") and is beneficial for health.
