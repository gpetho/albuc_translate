On the treatment of children born with imperforate urethras, or with narrow openings, or openings in the wrong place.	On the treatment of boys born with imperforate urinary meatus; or with the meatus small or not in the proper place.	0.7526756
Some boys may emerge from their mother's womb with an imperforate urethra.  It is necessary to proceed immediately with its perforation as soon as he is born.	Sometimes a boy is born from his mother's womb with the glans penis not perforate.	0.5965504
With a very fine scalpel, like this:	So at the moment of his birth you should be quick and make a perforation with a fine scalpel figured thus.	0.44389033
Then place in the hole a thin lead probe and tie it in place and keep it there for three or four days. When he needs to urinate, remove it and after he urinates replace it. And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows through the opening will prevent it from closing.	Then put in the opening a slender leaden sound, tie it and keep it in for three or four days. When he wishes to make water, it will be removed and he will do so; then put it back. If you do not put in the leaden sound it may be that the urine passing through the place will prevent the wound from healing.	0.86046153
As for the one whose opening is narrow, it is treated with the lead probe as we have described for many days until it widens. And those whose opening is in the wrong place, that is, some are born with the opening at the end of the penis, so they cannot urinate forward.	The case having too narrow a meatus should be treated with the leaden sound, as we have said, for many days until it is wide enough.	0.5429882
So he must lift the penis with his hand in order to urinate. And he is not born this way because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line, and this is a very ugly condition.  The way to operate in this case is to have the patient lie on his back.	In those cases having a misplaced meatusâ€”for example, there are some born with the opening at the edge of the glans so that they cannot make water forwards until the opening of the penis is lifted up by hand, nor can they beget, since the semen cannot reach directly to the uterus, a disorder which is very ugly.	0.6026472
Then you stretch his penis with your left hand, stretching it firmly, and you cut the tip of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel, the size of a pen, or as if you are carving something so that its middle protrudes, resembling a penis, and so that the opening is located in the middle as it should be.	The manner of operating in this case is for the patient to lie back; then with your left hand draw out his glans firmly and cut the end of the glans at the place of the meatus with a broad knife or sharp scalpel, as if sharpening a pen, or as if you were whittling something, so that the middle of it protrudes like a glans penis and the opening falls in the middle as it should.	0.741687
And be cautious during the procedure of bleeding, for it often happens, so counteract it with what stops the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.	And beware, in your operating, of haemorrhage, which often happens; meet it with styptics and dress the wound until it heals.	0.7151989
