This is an abscess enveloped in a covering resembling a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;	A varix is a twisted tumour resembling a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, which makes movement and exercise and walking difficult for the patient.	0.63871676
and the treatment of this illness is almost as dangerous as the one before, and yet we will tell you the procedure for it, according to what the ancients did.	The treatment of this condition is of uncertain outcome, akin to those conditions just spoken of. Nevertheless we must describe the operation for this condition as it was performed by the Ancients.	0.67166084
You must have the patient sit on a raised seat, then push the suspensory of the testicles down with your fingers, along with the vessels that are next to the penis, and have the assistant hold them, and stretch them firmly;	So I begin by saying that you must have the patient sitting upon a high seat; then push down the suspensor of the testicles and take hold of the skin of the testicles with your fingers together with the blood-vessels near the penis; then let your assistant take hold instead of you and draw out strongly.	0.8180047
then cut with a wide, transverse cutting spatula near the vessels, until they are exposed, and then dissect on each side, as we have described in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;	Then with a broad sharp scalpel make an oblique incision in the direction of the vessels so that the vessels are laid bare. Then dissect on all sides in the same way as I told you for extracting the temporal vessels.	0.6951983
then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the screw came, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, along the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted fluids;	Then run through them a needle doubly threaded and tie at the spot where the varix begins and tie it again where the varix ends, then cut through the varix in the middle with an incision at right angles to the length of the body and draw out the turbid corrupt humidity that has gathered in it.	0.79421496
then treat the wound like the others where you generate pus, unless some vessel falls that nourishes one of the testicles;	Then dress the wound with the wound dressings usual where you wish to encourage suppuration, so that the vessels nourishing the one testicle may perish; there is no harm in that.	0.61420107
for no harm comes from this, and if a screw comes to all the vessels, then it is necessary to pull the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and they dry up and cannot be helped.	But if all the vessels are varicose then you will have to remove one testicle with its vessels lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment through cutting into the vessels; for it will wither and be of no use.	0.6986924
