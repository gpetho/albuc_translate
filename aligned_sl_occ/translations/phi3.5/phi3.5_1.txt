Oh children, you have completed this book at the end of science or medicine (here "es derier" is derived from Latin and means 'is near'/'has reached'), which I hold in high regard as a result of your effort/diligence (implied by “la fi en lu”), through explanations ("exposicios"), statements, implying that you have made it clear to me how much dedication has gone into this subject matter. It's impressive because the book is part of surgical operations or procedures ('operacio am ma'), and even relates directly to (or possibly involves) cauterization ("es a mi vist que yeu complesca aquel").
When the operation is subdued in our region and at all times privately, while I remain hidden from him; only a few descriptions written freely by ancient authors have been altered by me, which correct these errors and their superstition, establishing clear intentions of them and lengthening (expanding) both the art and force.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May be the reason why not to abandon our craft at this time as medicine is long and it requires that one exerthy oneself in anatomical science which knows Gualia within what he/she understands about the forms of their limbs, joint connections and separations; also knowing bones, nerves, muscles, names of these parts, blood flow pulsing places and quieting points as well as locations for medical intervention.
Through Aqua Ippicus's teachings we understand that it may be small in work and primarily within the field of medicine.
May we already have told you about that in the entrance of this free space; who do not know what we've told them regarding anatomy, they will fall into error and serve deadly purposes if they see even parts of these things, as those formed herein are derived from our knowledge and practice.
Here is the line-by-line translation:
Here comes another doctor who prescribes the ingestion of a large stone that had been processed in his state, and which was heavy; he pours this stone into a vessel from where it is drunk, so that by the third day this body (the patient) dies.
And you have called her out for removal due to the great size of the stone and its position within the bladder that led to death.
And here comes another doctor who takes a salary from our lord the Duke of this land to perform surgery; and he brings with him a black instrument which was used by him as a fracture fixer in his patient'thy thigh, preparing himself due to ignorance. He fixes the fracture on the ground using strong structures like pillows and tables, without laying down breath for it there.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: Apply it according to your wishes, and apply pressure as needed throughout each day; this is when the thigh' extrusion enters the rectum hole, arriving at evacuation (implying that applying correct methods of treatment or managing such a medical condition can prevent further complications).
And they called for him, and provided instruments to loosen the ligament, achieving calmness and alleviation of his pains.
Even though decay has been confirmed in the limb, so that it cannot be restrained and does not cease to spread within while under the malady' extraterritorial influence (the external factor contributing to or exacerbating the condition).
And another doctor pierced an abscess, and it became ulcerated daily until the wickedness of him came upon his lordship.
The cause is that the skull has been heated with melancholalgy humors; however, it does not affect him entirely but rather the member wherein he was already affected.
And for these reasons, boys, it is necessary for you to devise the operation in two parts: one that concerns health and another where there is risk involved.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "E yeu ja he exsitat aquo en tot loc de aquest libre en le qual venc opperacio en la qual es error e temor; per que necessari es a vos que guardetz aquo e layssetz aquel, per que les folhs no atrobo via a parlar e a vos desonestar.

When gout appears in some of her patients: Not a physician of illness does not know its name.
And you have already delved into this free second volume three chapters deep.
Begins the division of free space, and first from the primary partitioned area. The ordered first chapter within the feet, in terms of instruments and iron tools for cauterization, what is needed therein.
The division of the second partition. The second chapter on probing and puncturing, and of vials, and pus extraction from herbs and similars, all is arranged according to the forms of instruments used herein.
The third part of restoration and displacement, as well as the treatment for twisting and similitude to those patients within their bodies: ordered by head inside weighty forms using instruments.
When you determine the quality of that poultice and its effects on him/her, and in which part it is forbidden to apply cauterization.
So that the language of cautery and its obscurity is long and complex according to science, flowing with subtleties; they discuss much about it among themselves, and I have heard enough for my needs.
And so it is said that the pointed cautery comforts all of the body universally, except for two types of matter within its substance. These are tail ends (caudal parts) of its material.
In the complexity of a dry and arid matter; they find that tools are beneficial for treating it therein, while others recommend those opposite to facilitate healing, as this condition is characterized by its quality and dryness, making moisture treatment inconvenient. Here'dictates:

Through the speech of that person, I have come across some experiences myself.
Indeed no cover that which has been drained and worked out in the chair of cautery for yesterday's exercise, understanding the complexity of human composition and the disposition of illnesses within their bodies, as well as the causes of those ailments and the timing thereof.
May also in other complexities there is not fear on you, mainly due to the chills and wet humors, whereupon all doctors are agreed upon these matters; they have no concern with using caution when performing cautery here.

May the medicine that is applied burn to reach him in those parts where he lies ill and make it difficult for his sick body part as well as making them leave (recover or get better).
May the focus, due to its sublimity and beneficial substance, only exert what is necessary It has already been understood by us through experimentation and long study in the art concerning truth about causes; therefore, it excuses from lengthy discourse Here you are now present at this pause for our secret amuctions on the focus area. The quality of your operation within the body' extrusion that expels illnesses is demonstrated philosophically herein reflected upon (with) in these pads
And wise ones know that it is best for applying cauterizations and breaks when the first season begins.
Even it is said that cautery is convenient at all times, in such a way that the harm caused by water that has been retained due to the use of cautery heals itself, and mainly when used for pains or necessary punctures, needles, which do not suffer delays because they are feared as malicious influences causing greater damage than small injuries over time.
So do not touch your feet or legs; these are only valued by the common people and ignorant physicians, which is why curing with cautery cannot completely eliminate this ailment, nor can you halt its consequences.
E the cause is not due to excessive drinking whereas cauterization occurs in a place of medicine that changes complexity and removes the dampness which are causes for pain coming.
Even though surplus instruments are used in medicine due to the value of their function and greatness of work done by one'thy lord,

The First Article/Chapter (assuming "Le capitol" translates to an introduction or initial point in a medical text): This cauterization will confer humidity and cold on the accidental instrument used for these causes, which is soda and excessive airflow from breathing, applying pressure downward from head to limbs and chest; this includes prolonged sleep, dental pain, general suffering associated with frostbite or hypothermia—often accompanied by paralysis, numbness (sody), convulsions (apoplexy), and feigned conditions.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the malady to be expelled through medicine cleansing for three or four days, depending on how much urine it excretes and its habits.
When the lord commands his head to rise and places that segment between their masses on top of an erected bench, holding them there over their chest,

Of the pointed cautery of the head/capillary (as '
When in the entire head/capillary there is chronic and long-lasting pain, using swords and lances and cappurges and emplastrates, among other things; primarily if any such has already been cauterized with a tool that does not alleviate it—consider whether the swelling in the head/capillary is due to strong calcification inherent in its nature. It's neither folly nor brutality for significant cause of inflammation, and thus this other instrument should also be applied there immediately. Return that over the patient's head (possibly referring to applying pressure or heat) with caution, as long as the spine is divided/separated for treatment purposes using a heating device like an electric blanket or similar source of warmth. Translation: Cut the ribcage and expose its extent as we have counted and sealed it with a cauterizer in the part of the back where you call upon us to perform this action—this is the place where suction has been applied. And lift your hand so high that you do not see the belly (abdomen), for when it aggrathyously crushes, causing great pain different from pains of other cautery on the head.

Capital torture.
Of ancient non-antidotal cauterization.
When severe pain occurs in the head or when it becomes stiff and causes discomfort therein, medicine is administered by medical professionals for treatment, which has been mentioned among remedies for diseases; without this action one cannot fully address it, hence cauterization can be performed using either medicinal acid combustion tools or iron.
May needles be used in medicine to apply a hot iron and take away the pain from both ends of your limbs; grasp that vessel tightly with one hand while removing each extremity bit by bit using another tool. And apply pressure at the location of pain on the temple with one lance inserted there where it is hidden within that site of flesh and bone.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And there ensure care for that which is within it so healed.
If you come, apply some of these burned remedies that have been written in the section on burning medicines to the wound.
May the cauterization be with iron according to this method: which is of this kind.
And they call it a tightening of the joints because the head (the top part) takes on the shape of a little flower in which some curving occurs at that spot where there is heat, small and concentrated within the body.
Return the pause over the location of pain, and hold your hand—so that it is not crushed which has just come—and turn the iron needle slowly by speed.
If the amount of blood that has been collected through the catheter is as much as when it was inserted and you place your hand over to prevent the artery from being pierced further, thereby avoiding bleeding out (the flow of bile).
Return the wound to water soaked in salt and leave it there for three days, then apply pressure bandage on its edges, and take care that your hand is inside until healed.
If you go, then perform a cauterization at the tip of the scalpel according to proper procedure, and keep yourself away from cutting an artery here which is not yet ancient (i.dict).

When you treat empyema (an old method of dealing with this condition), and what has been discussed in the past about its cure, if not properly addressed; sometimes when even more than just the initial salve or applied treatment for abscesses does not suffice—when the poultice is ignited within the cavity to heal it (the place of pain along a long line which signifies where that issue lies), and you rest your hand over this area while using incense, allowing smoke from burning herbs such as sage or lavender; thereby providing relief.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuation of jaw movement since your teeth are crooked and need chewing (mastication), so that the jaw does not ache and do not provoke nerve pain which may lead to spasm.
If it is about the custody and caution of blood flow from an artery that expands, there is fear in him who does not know what causes this expansion and how to treat it—and perform the operation at once.
When they come for memory recall of the sanitation flow according to their ruling system here in this place.
If you feel that the patient cannot bear this illness and if it becomes necessary in their groin where we have previously mentioned applying cauterization (using heat), then perform such treatment there while taking care of the inside to heal what is within them.
If you go onwards with the pointed instrument we have mentioned earlier in heat treatment for stopping bleeding using two hot coals as a heating source, better is this and further action will be taken.
Captain of this matter (or) Chief physician overseeing
The captain, or chief physician here is in charge of the treatment for joint pains caused by golden humors (referring to yellowish substances believed to cause
When in the thigh there is pain caused by congestion and it requires treatment for these causes (suggesting blockages or accumulations), they are addressed with cauterization as mentioned earlier. This refers to a specific form of this procedure, which involves puncturing—the method described previously where points may be made on the surface using pointed instruments like cautery needles. The pain is not alleviated by mere heat; rather, it requires active intervention through these methods (cauterization and possibly aspiration or reduction as indicated in surrounding text).
Apply the puncturing for cauterization here (referring back to needlework or incision), and it should be done across all of the thigh affected area, moving in a circular motion like when spinning with an arrow—or alternatively along any specific paths if pain is localized elsewhere. This indicates that physicians may choose different techniques based on where they identify arises from within this body part (the movement being analogous to treating wounds or abscesses by ensuring thorough coverage and circulation of air, which was believed important for healing). Long after you have used the caustic of this thigh, continue to apply it where there is persistent purulent (puss-like) material that may be present and indicative of infection or inflammation; suggesting ongoing treatment at those specific sites with cauterization. This underscpective medical practice aimed not just for immediate relief but also
If all points made on their entire body require heating and care for the locations that have been healed, then do so with caution in those places to ensure they remain healthy.
In this translation attempt of an archaic or regional medical text mixing
The phrase "cauzereza oti" seems like a mix-up between the Latin roots and possibly Italian
The translation appears to be attempting a blend of Latin with potentially regional or medical jargon that incorporates Italian terms:
Avoid using specialized caustic for such that it does not enter due to dryness or because of nervous spasm.
When you heal that special type of torture and cleaning the thighs and genitals without causing discomfort in your treatment, make sure to use these three cauterisms for treating hernia: take a golden needle firstly, then apply small touches with its temple, and lastly combine kisses from both of your lips.
When you stop the pointed cautery for the contrary parts of the diseased area, there is relief only in the healing portion that appears healthy.
When performing cauterization, apply the instrument at the very tip of the erect penis and in the temple where it is as long as his body length; place your hand inside so that a portion can be burned off until sufficient has been consumed by fire for what'dictates from the bone socket below.
This is how it goes with the cautery, and this form belongs to those who practice cutting (surgeons). Here they sit down nowads. May it be subtle that such a little excess is placed there; and where in the body there is an unnecessary surplus, place one of these as well.
Return care for what is now proceeding within so that it may be healed.

Caustic treatment of ancient apoplexy." This translates into English as follows:
When apoplexy is ancient and the remedy we have discussed does not concern your medicine or patient' extraneous temperament doesn't present fever, then perform these four cautions: on all heads of their skulls; in the spot where hair grows atop the head, as well; within the neck area – similarly to what has been mentioned before; and inside the ears. The operation of the cautery is said according to what has been previously stated.
And it has been cauterized on the stomach' extruded, and may he be healed by the water that flows through you (as if implying medicinal treatment).

Return your head completely under the patient's waist and place your hand on their chest, where it is described in detail within the treatise of appliances.
After some time has passed, that is when it becomes necessary for a cauterization. When that same doctor who was mentioned has already ordered it as stated before.
So if healing occurs through these means; otherwise, three cauteries are applied in the lower part of his head (the posterior part up to where the nape is), which belong to that portion coming from above. And there is space between each caustic of it (the treatment), and care must be taken for the water that comes forth from them.
If you increase and the patient' extrusion is tolerable, then apply heat at that spot with caustic substances; if it increases significantly, then burn across both corn areas.
Return that which has been healed within it; and use those cauldrons as they have been provided by the doctor (in reference to applying medicinal treatments or poultices).
The given medieval medical text appears incomplete or possibly contains shorthand not
From the provided fragments, it's clear that this treatise discusses methods for dealing with worm infestations and healing of all body parts:
When you process in the caulceration of the head and apply what we have discussed; return your attention to the skull'se surface, applying that very same pointed cautery where pain is felt on top of the head, as well as over all parts thereof divided by it (the division), also three times upon each spinal disc.
If it is necessary in the illness of suppuration at the joints and if the disease itself is severe, then apply four types of cauterization to the vertebrae of the back, and insert into where there is discomfort from the neck bone's motion, raising up the swelling. Return that which should be healed within it, and this is for caution with olive wax.

The sentence translates as: So, we must purify the patient's brain through consultation and other care measures determined during division when phlegm is abundant in its quantity or quality, and it tolerates no further medical intervention beyond these prescribed actions for treatment divisions. Here "mondifiques" refers to cleansing rituals which may have been a part of medieval medicine practices aimed at restoring balance within the body by removing harmful substances like phlegm (a concept from humoral theory). The phrase indicates that further intervention is not considered appropriate beyond these specific measures, suggesting an early understanding and respect
The translation of the sentence would be: If it is a child who does not suffer from medicines, administer gargarism solutions and masticatories for cleaning purposes, through mouth application over several days, with good food intake as nourishment during this treatment period. This line suggests an approach to treating conditions such as throat infections or dental issues using home remedies like saltwater rinses (gargarism solutions) and chewables for maintaining hygiene while ensthyers the importance of nutritional support ("good
The translated sentence would read: Raise the phlegm from the head and apply a caustic there where it has formed (perhaps as an abscess), following previous indications; another application of caustics is made on the back part of the skull, along with cauterizations at any spot upon the patient'se head that was treated. Here physicians in medieval times are guided by a specific humoral approach where they believe phlegm (a key humor imbalance) needs to be removed from certain body areas and uses caustic substances as an intervention, which aligns with historical treatments for conditions thought to involve excessive fluids or impurities If the gallbladder is strong and tolerant, then apply that which I have described upon it, causing numbness and softening of the body over the lower back and pelvis bones.

When the causes of melancholy are rotten and thick moisture, then apply those same caustics that we have for arthritic joints in order to treat it (the state). Here 'cauterization' is used metaphorically as a treatment method. The text suggests using caustic substances traditionally employed for treating inflamed or infected body parts, which they believe can also be applied internally within the abdomen ('haven') in order to address paralysis associated with severe melancholy (depression
If the cause of melancholy is excess and causes inflammation in the body (maelstrom), then apply what has been used before to purify one's mind according to when it was first divided ('division').

Here they suggest using a compress made from hemp fabric over wounds where instruments have been used (to prevent fire hazards) while ensuring control of any nosebleeds by properly applying one'dict clamping device without causing further distress to oneself or complicating the patient’s humoral state. The line combines medieval medical practices with a concern for both safety and symptomatic relief, emphasizing careful handling during procedures that could pose risks of fire (given heated instruments) as well as nosebleeds which were common treatment indicators at the time.
So if the instrument (likely for treating nosebleeds or similar) is inserted into the mouth during treatment, then be; but otherwise iterate the use of said tool as directed by skillful practice and leave it therein until three days have passed—and apply a pause over that border area with borders soaked in expulsive ointment to aid healing. This instruction underlines hygiene (cleanliness) during treatment, recommends timely reassessments of the condition treated by such instrumentation for up to three days before additional intervention is considered or possibly required—and suggests a therapeutic measure involving expulsive ointment which could have been used as part of medieval wound care routines. The use of 'borders' and specific timing indicates an approach that balances direct treatment with restorative practices consistent with the period’s medical understanding, wherein observation over a fixed duration was standard before further action

Thus, when pauses (likely referring to intermittent pressure or cauterization) are applied above the opening of the fistula in either a heated cloth or water, the lead deposits themselves stay within that location and consequently heal it miraculously.
If the fistula is healed by the water we have from cautery and treatment, then it will be; but if not, you must administer purgatives internally and reduce the fistula in its natural place as soon as possible when it comes to that location.

When in the throat or on the palate there is an abscess and decay, which we address by bleaching it with our remedies as much as necessary according to how severe that condition within its cavity appears—this implies a treatment protocol using heat (possibly through applied fire) targeting where metal instruments reach those lesions. We provide care for the same issue while not overstepping or misusing healing, ensuring no further damage occurs; thus we place our flame in contact with that abscess's cavity and let it penetrate until such a time when (after some use—implied to be one or two uses) its effects are felt within the affected area. It’s important here for health care providers of this era not only treat but also understand what appropriate healing involves, ensdicting caution in applying heat as part of curative measures with awareness and restraint during such interventions—this highlights an early understanding that treatment should be both effective yet gentle to avoid exacerbating the condition.
So if the disease has been removed and healed, be well; otherwise, it is necessary to discover where it resides and hold back the decayed bone as it comes forth in its course.

When toothache is due to dryness or the presence of a cold/worm that does not respond well to care as provided by medicine, then there are two types of caustic interventions: one at the cow'thy borders and another on the mouth (referring potentially to specific areas used for treatment).
Cauterize is where you grip the edge of cowhide and iron, and wrap it over the extremity of the torture point, applying pressure to that bordered area until it becomes inflamed (or "burns"). Wrap another piece at the borders where blood has hit this spot, enveloping it entirely. Apply gentle pressure there so long as is necessary for the painful spot within its dentition begins to swell and burn.
When you apply that certain medicine for several times until the force of the fire reaches the core of the heart, wherein lies its seat (the mind or soul).
If you wish, submerge wool or cloth at the bottom of this passage, and place it over the sore tooth, placing your hand on top where the heated iron enters during treatment into the cavity of the affected tooth.
Must the cauterization be done at the focus (source of heat or iron), and if there is any swelling in the chest, ensure that the focused flame does not reach the mouth of the malady.
Return the brand of this instrument to its shape, and hold it over your teeth so that the cautery becomes heated; apply some oil several times whether the pain is intensifying today or tomorrow.
When the mouth of that patient is opened by the action of such caustic for an hour, and their tongue is wiped with it at this time, then this is the form of the caustic.
And if you can perform it as directed by means of caustic (which is what I will use), then proceed accordingly with that which has been indicated for treatment according to your ability.

And when external protrusions (like hernias) are formed by infiltrating humors and fluids that do not conform to the body's natural shape, you use a cauterization tool shaped accordingly; with two handles so it can be ignited at one end while held or supported near its other extremity. Ignite this device for some time over the protrusion (apothem) and stop when symptoms have lessened to that extent of relief, ensuring you leave no residue on the affected area; if further intervention is required after ignition has ceased at the site, ensure it happens before healing starts.
If the apopulation is small, then use the points of the cautery according to its quantity; apply it for three days and pause over it until such time when the fire from the focus has burned out.

There is also cauterization for hernias and an additional caustic above, likely on either skin (as mentioned later), the thoracic cavity—potentially related to issues of breathing or chest pains in historical contexts where such symptoms might have been attributed differently than today's understanding. Plus two cauterists between each pair of spines and another caustic at the very tip, which could signify treatment for conditions affecting extremities like fractures that required immediate attention to prevent further damage or complications in an era when medical interventions were limited as compared with modern standards. The quantity of the depth of the cautery is determined by the sharpness of the needle.

From the context of your previous translations and considering that "cauterize" refers to using heat or some form of treatment (which could be interpreted as early forms of medical intervention),
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and when this kind of pain occurs in the feet, it has become a common practice among doctors to refer to it as gout (podagra).
And when gout pain due to cold humors is healed by the treatment of medicine and there are no more pains left untreated, then apply treatments with hot cupping instruments.
When you are cauterizing that portion of elimination in the circulatory channel between the foot and the groin, with your own burners.
That is the form of this tool: (The olive wood used for it)
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery for that purpose. If the pains penetrate into the abdomen or other joints and their movements become restless, then treat that area with three to four of these same caustic applications from this cautery overall.
If you have the necessary cautery tools here, then apply that one to where needed without pressing too hard with your hand at once; send only enough of what is already on the needle therein (to the lancet).
If pain penetrates into the area between the thighs and knees, then apply the treatment that we have mentioned in this chapter.
If the pain is only in the feet and it's called sour excess (indicating a condition possibly related to acidity or imbalance of humors), then they will make an incision along the circuit of the bilious passages, making punctures in those two lines.
If there are residual pains in the head and on each bone of the mouth (which could imply issues with teeth or jaw), then make a puncture at the circumference around every tooth and under the tongue'zymes, where their blood flows.
If joint or muscle pain occurs during the days at the knees or shoulders, then they will perform cautery on all parts of their aids (assistants).
And if there is a blockage in the malady and good regimen along with intake of medicine allows for its removal through this cautery instrument, God helps.

This means using gentle pressure or other methods to ensure the wound inside will heal within its own time, avoiding aggressive interventions when they are unwarranted for proper recovery according to medieval medical reasoning presented in this treatise fragment.
In this fragment: "E aprop segua le malaute entre las tuas mas sobre le sieu dos," the physician suggests following up with gentle treatment of the patient'dicts lower parts, specifically over their legs (which might be referred to as 'bodies'). The instruction is for someone else or an instrument ("lu") holding and controlling how much pressure ('their hands') should apply. If a hernia appears near these regions—where it may have pushed through the body wall into this area, known here simply
In this fragment: "E aprop retorna aquel am les tieus ditz e senha am tenta la ruptura sobre le os del pentenilh," the physician is directing to return what has come, which likely refers back to any material or substance that was used previously in an attempt (possibly cautery) on a specific part of the body with fingers. Here, "pentennial" can be interpreted as referring perhaps to 'fifteen years' old', though this is not common medical terminology and might simply represent confusion from translating archaic

Therefore if it is healed by the first application of cautery, be; but if not, repeat over him those same applications of cautery until his malady (the swelling) has been reduced to a point where its movement ceases and enters into that womb from which they came. According to custom for these pains it is said that the points on each limb directed towards their origin in the uterus are punctured, so as to prevent further progression of those same cauteries within the malady until healing occurs.

And when you intend to cauterize that one, consider whether the leprosy is present and has been treated with the water we have discussed in this division, nor here or there does it remain, nor on the body of him/her altogether; for a lancet will be used at the top of the head where hair grows back, between two pubic mounds, behind both shoulders (servants), and over two calluses.

And let that pointed cautery enter into the hollow of the neck with a few. Return that which is inside of it with care; for when it has been healed within its cavity by this means, then remove your cautery (the pointed instrument used
In some cases the patient may experience numbness in their arms and legs, as well as at the vertebrae of the spine where nerves pass through; these symptoms occur even before surgery for this condition (gout), which involves cauterization to treat areas like those mentioned.

In this translation of "Capitol .liii.", I interpreted it as referring to the treatment or identification of movement corruption within the limb—comparable to how dry wood burns with fire, suggesting an organic decay process that can be seen in certain medical conditions. The sentence implies a need for intervention similar to cauterization used historically by
Translated as: "Therefore if you observe the movement-corrupting area where was previously subjected to cautery using a small twig or bone splinter, then burn with fire large enough according to what is necessary at that location for which corruption occurs." Here, it seems like an instruction on how one might readdress areas affected by decay (referred metapsychologically as movement-corrupting) through the application of heat—implying a form of cauterization using fire. This aligns with ancient medical practices where burning was used for healing certain conditions,
Translated as: "Therefore heat the area fully where you have managed to remove all decay and eliminate any cause of illness." This sentence instructs on a healing process, possibly following an operation or treatment aimed at completely clearing out disease (represented here by 'corrosion') from within someone's body using fire as a tool for c
Translated as: "Heal that area for three days, and pause over the cauterized locations until all scars are completely healed out, and total decay is eliminated." This line of instruction suggests a post-treatment care regimen focusing on recovery time from both physical wounds (scarring) and internal corruption or disease. It indicates that complete recuperation involves patience during the cauterization period followed by thorough healing without residual damage, which would be essential knowledge for medical practitioners in a historical context where understanding of pathology was
Return care for that which is in fleshly origin within them (the humors causing pain).
If in three days the flesh that has just been born is clean and healthy as such, then no treatment (cauterization) is needed; otherwise, repeat the use of caustics on what has become spoiled in those places.
Corrosive substances are used in some acute medicine treatments; that is where they act as caustics. May occasionally applied focused heat from a poultice be beneficial for draining purulent (pus-filled) joints.

Leaves that enter for three days after beginning therapy with gout treatment are as follows: Here the cauterizing agent is applied to that wounded part of salted hemp fibers and it should be spread over there for a moment until said wound disappears from their reasons/causes.
Return care for that location where flesh has been generated inside while it is being healed.
If it is not converted (turned into water), and bleeding continues on the surface of the body, mostly in hands and feet, you must apply moisture with a cupped or iron cautery hand, holding these items: either an earthen jar containing water, barely filled; place your hand over this vessel. Turn it (the instrument) continuously until compressed completely by your hand; then secure the nozzle of the container into the keyhole already made in that part, and forcefully expel a stream through this hole down to where you inserted the needle previously—wait for only an hour after applying said moisture before rinsing it (the instrument) off. Afterward, if necessary keys are bent outwards as intended by their use:

When arterial flow is obstructed in these areas, it'thy not possible to restrict the vessels therein unless one of four methods are used: or with cautery where we have them inserted (instruments), when they should be extracted if extraction isn’t performed and upon removal their extremities will burn up and further constrict the vessel, or a pinch is applied using force for strong extension (or bone setting) of those limbs secured by mortise joints in sturdy splints.

When the operation in that case is where moisture (humidity) is between the chin and bone and the abscess is small, then you cut at the warm location of your head to create one fissure along the jawline, with this being the form of a spur:

Strengthen the head for equal balance; feed dietary dry food until there is comfort and healing in the body part concerned.
Here comes another operation method you should consider: the size of the ulcer and the collection of water around it may sometimes occur at the back of the skull, or in the area above, or on the right side, or on the left side; therefore pay attention to where the ulcer and fluid accumulation appear, so that when they do become visible, you can proceed with incision.

When one comes to catharsis and continues with it, sometimes the intestines of malaise (implying an imbalance or sickness) become tired, and their examination reveals ulcerated lips and fur from licking them excessively; inside the head there is a sharp, throbbing pain extending beyond conscious understanding—these are signs that these matters have not come directly but through veins of disintegrating parts.

Therefore, the consideration is that if such great size originates from water appearing in their eyes and affects the entire body due to its moistness, it stems from cold (or 'leuggier' as per medieval medical terminology).

When treating the condition that is present below (in) the lower part of the eye lid, this line suggests focusing on an issue located beneath the bottom eyelid in medieval medical terminology:
When the hue lid is contracted (shut tight), it occurs with contraction of part or all in either side ('right' and 'left'), due to poor consolidation of foulness or flesh, as well as tendons or thorns/cauteries – this condition may be caused by such malformations. It is treated through the cleansing (purification) of impurity within these parts; when it arises spontaneously ('natural') or accidentally due to them being in poor repair, which can also simulate diseases:
May the cause of labor in you be that which cuts through that solidification and separates their lips, pausing within the cloth between those two stones where there is water, binding them while they are healed.
When using the method of curing for its causes that remove humors (presumably referring to a therape extrication technique), constrict; but if it returns blood poison, there is no place in this life where such illness can dwell forever.
Use that which mollifies the joints when mixed with honey and taken in water wherein are crushed stones or dipped quills of flax (fenugreek), or waxen drops dissolved by alkaline waters into it, then immerse yourself therein for healing.

When you address speech continuity in one of these connections (referring to the act of speaking and maintaining control over saliva), there is little concern unless it's about men with certain conditions that might affect their ability, possibly related to motor disorders or neurological issues.

So, if any of these causes affect men (referring to potential issues causing drooling), consider that it might be due to fresh food stuck under the tongue ("sieu sanc"), and you should adjust your lips accordingly when performing a stitch or surgical repair; also ensure proper care for whatever is lodged in their mouth. This translation reflects practices possibly related to dietary causes of drooling, suggesting that medieval medical practitioners recognized certain food items as potential irritants requiring dental attention and lip adjustment during treatment procedures like suturing where oral hygiene might be a concern due to the condition being treated. The emphasis on care for whatever
If the lips involved in speech continuity have already been separated (which could imply surgical separation or some other form of intervention), and there is any healing necessary, then cover each separate section where it appears that food remnants may be present; this suggests a focus on hygiene to prevent further complications during the recovery process.

The text appears to be a medieval medical treatise discussing the condition of inflamed gums (possibly referring to gingivitis or periodontal disease), with particular attention given by "doctors" (referred to as 'apelero' in this context) who observe these symptoms and seek remedies. Here is an attempt at translating it into modern English:
Return your hand above the area treated with crushed or cauterizing powders, or worms that excrete such materials.
If that flesh returns, then immediately inspect it and cauterize it; thus the cautery will not return.

Now we have seen their work done by barbers (medical practitioners at that time often included minor surgical procedures).
So that you can confirm what the painful tooth is and understand it'dictly, then cut into the circuit of the affected tooth above which there may be any movement (implying an abscess or infection), dissolve whatever remains within the entirety of its gum line, and apply pressure with your fingers gradually inside where that has occurred until when you feel those tender areas.

When the tooth that has broken down requires removal due to any cause, you must pause there overnight or for two nights until the location is softened; and then apply an analgesic pillow with pieces of cushioning material (such as foam rubber) between which are assembled forceps. This translation suggests a medieval approach where time was allowed to naturally set before extraction, followed by careful pain management using specially designed instruments such as couches or makeshpective padding fitted into the beaks of birds for use with these tools (forceps).
The pieces are made from sharp stones like flint or agate as dental instruments, indicating that in medieval times they used naturally available materials to create cutting tools for extraction procedures without modern anesthesia. The mention of "flint" and "agate," which were often fashioned
If you do not follow your instructions while using these forceps or pliers, then bend over the root and remove all flesh with that tool which has this form (describing a specific shape of instrument), holding it by its small handle. This translation highlights an alternative method where one would manually extract what's left from dental extraction sites if proper instruments were not used or understood, emphasizing reliance on simpler tools like bone files for cleaning out residual material post-extraction during the medieval period before modern technology was available in medicine.
And if it is a small but heavy limb that does not break (i.e., cannot be broken), then do not attempt to forcefully manipulate or fracture it.

The text suggests that these sharpened instruments are crucial
Of the triangle cut either long or short, which is not heavy and does not begin to bend: this should be ensured for it must hold its form without flexing under pressure.

The passage suggests an evolution in medical understanding or practice, where new techniques are being developed to deal with illnesses previously outside the scope of traditional knowledge—an artisan's (physician) progress and their expanding toolkit for treating diverse conditions hinted at by "species." It speaks to a time when medicine began recognizing more than it could before, perhaps

From the extraction of a ranula, place your hand on the tongue area so as not to let the sucked out substance
Some times, after suctioning out the ranula (a mucous cyst in the floor of the mouth), there are acrid sensations on the tongue due to local anesthesia applied during minor procedures; and fortunately this is limited within that which has been inside the mouth.

This passage provides instructions on how a medical practitioner should proceed if they encounter moisture and white substance—which could be spit or saliva-like mucus—when attempting an intervention such as treating for a ranula, possibly suggesting methods of gentle probing to assess what needs further treatment. It also advises on how the practitioner should pause if distracted by wind (noise) during their work and briefly rinse or clean affected areas with vinegar-like solutions while being careful not to touch stones inside the mouth, which could be remnants of food particles that need further

With your hand on that tool which we have mentioned beforehand, also place it in contact with fresh water as indicated above in the methodology section of our treatment plan; this will comfort them and ensure proper depth (not too thick nor subtle) for completing the concavity shape needed by this instrument:
The external cavity in which medicine is applied as with the handle of a knife, and where we place our tools within it for its use; hereby saliva or mucus from that person' extrinsic body emerges into this space through their mouth so that none may arise therefrom to harm whatsoever upon them.

The care must avoid causing ulcerations as part of its healing process; and it suggests attention should be paid to both prevention measures taken before delivery, like prenatal care or environmental factors that may affect fetal health ("cranc"), along with the postnatal treatment applied during labor (the "causa" relates here not only to birth processes but also potentially encompasses preconceptional influences).

The provided line from the medieval medical treatise appears to discuss issues related to male genital health, specifically mentioning pain in the foreskin at the head of the penis and due to corruption (likely referring to decay or disease) and adhesion (stickiness). Here is a possible translation:
Movements worsen this condition in the belly and it is an excess of fatty tissue.
From that one it is harmful (or malevolent), and from others not so harmlthy/maleficent.
No malicious, cover that detaches subtly and separates what is within it entirely; and pause over that spot submerges in Egyptian oil, and apply this ointment inside wherein the patient shall be healed completely.
If the gallbladdig is evil and of dark hue, then make sure to apply caustic preparations internally into its liver and kidneys.
If the foreskin is present on the head of the penis, and one part has been cut (circumcision), while another remains intact because you have it there; once this division has healed within where you hold it to support, after treating that uncut portion as well, your care ensures that no separation will occur when caring for the circumcised area.
And examine the testicles and foreskin blackness and hardening; consequently cover all that has already been darkened or is at risk of corruption, placing linens on it soaked in honey made from ground flaxseed mixed with berries and crushed herbs.
Return that treatment there is for it inside so as it becomes healthy again.

The refinement of children and the care for those who are circumsized, please translate:
Circumcision is not a cure for the continuation of diseases: however, when it comes from our work and intention, and in children specifically, we must assign them to better healing methods as quickly as possible.
So it is said that ancient ones did not perform circumcision among free men, nor do they use in their clothes, and only acquire them through experimentation. This causes the loss of a large part of artisans and barbarians to practice circumcision and mundification with new tools such as knives and tweezers; using ligature made from sinew and sharp stone grain (or chisel).
E you have already tried all these methods and found no better improvement than with the knife in surgery, where motions escape from below the waistline pushed outwards, those of the pubis between two tunics, and hernia downstaged quickly; thus forcing yourself to other insight into secure relief. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And for ablution (cleansing), which is caused by phlebitis and from whose use fingers are employed with forceps, it'dictly does not secure the insensibility of the extremity of the male member; rather quickly enters into its cavity.
In the operation with a knife, if you are not careful and cause damage, it will ruin your work. The natural tongue of a child is short by nature, and they habitually bite in such manner that there is no need for dental cleaning; it has been observed.
May the world-making that is made from fores and sinew of a horse' extruded by me; I have experimentally discovered this myself, so as when the length (thickness) of these tools corresponds proportionately to their thickness in use—and thus with two determined lengths at hand, you shall measure them accordingly according to your understanding; resulting is the compression of the fores shaped into a figure within which there will be no error from all sides.
The first sentence translates as follows: The primary aspect of the operation is that you make the child mostly lie on their side and let them stay inside for another day.
When that joy is what you can achieve with whatever knowledge comes into your mind, E prepare yourself to maintain that state between your thighs and not be distracted; hide the saw blades in your hand or undernethy legs so that the child does not see those nor any other of them from the tools.

Retain urine in the bladder is considered a fault due to excess bone or stone formation, or kidney stones, and seem similar to those mentioned by healers for curative purposes during division.
If there is not dissolution of the water that we have mentioned strongly as a cause over the patient' extricable body (their humors), then it becomes necessary to remove them using an instrument they appeal to, which takes this form: It can be made of silver and subtle lion conquest.

When acute inflammation occurs in the bladder or abscess, or when it is coarsely treated with an enema procedure using water and medicinal solutions, this becomes necessary—the form of treatment involves a catheter (which I refer to as "clampcuda"). This is how:
sino que in the exterior of it is silent, so it is closed. And in that way three troubles arise from one division, which happens twice.
In the meal is calmness where it rests and its second quantity that rises up to draw from those humidities; when any cause takes them away, they are drawn back again, and when expelled for a long time, so much as phlegm accumulates in sea battles.
So when you want to prevent moisture in the bladder, insert the extremity of crab' extrusion into the moistness, and draw out that water which pushes against the cavities below it; thus removing humidity from where its entrance is located.
Return the intestine to its cavity and apply pressure with the moisture you have introduced into it; this same wetness will move downwards towards the bladder as far as possible, and inflammation (or swelling) of the ureter will result.

Nos ja havem dit en la divisio las specias de peyra e curacio de lu am medicinas": Translation: "We have here in the division of bone and stone for medicine's purpose," indicating a discussion or focus on categorizing different types of stones (peyra) used in medical treatments.
Here they have said that operation takes place in this stone where I act as well as part of a team/sequence (sección).
The English translation of this medieval medical treatise line by line is as follows:
And here you are describing that which has been revealed in its manifestation and condensed form.
So say that stones are produced mainly in the bladder and resemble water due to their subtlety, appearing therein; moreover, it is said of them that they fry the urethra with dripping urine flows, which dresses its threadbare area. Here come various actions:
This is how healthily children of that place have reached fourteen years old, and it's difficult to cure them in their bodies. May in young people move due to these fluids that circulate among them.
From that from which the stone is larger and the cautery softer/lighter; if it is little, contrary to that.
So when you arrive at the treatment of that, cover it with bread from the crust whereby it exits entirely through those holes which are within your belts; for that hole sometimes prohibits the entrance of dirt into its bed, requiring investigation by yourself.
Return its position to the hips and thighs (and contains excess heat/pain) in order that the urethral stone may descend into the bladder or jump from place to place a few times.
Apply that catheter you prepared between your thighs and the rest of his things are now on him; thus ensuring that the bladder as a whole descends downwards gradually.
Return that which has been taken away for all of it (the patient).
Therefore, if you feel pain in the space, then touch it gently with your hand on top of it.
If you have not yet touched the patient' extrication in all these days as indicated on their left side (if they are stillborn), or if it is because of a womb that has been completed for youth, then touch them there and insert your hand into their belly. Through which part of the body does this secret dwell? (What bodily region is it hidden in?) When that small object enters into the neck of the bladder.
And place it on that limb you mentioned earlier, and remove it from the parts without returning to where your team was located.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return within it is how this thing appears or enters: and cut the water that is between the anus and intestines, not in their location but from the left hip socket; on top of this stone it places its section above, forming a transverse section to ensure that the section becomes wide and pierced according to the quantity necessary for what can be done with the stone currently located in the belly, without exceeding, lest you crush the part wherein is contained the intestine.
E as you know there are joints and angles on the stone where it is difficult for him to be healed by water.
From that fluid it looks like a lion' extruding its essence and is round in shape; this liquid gold requires distillation (refining).
Therefore adjust it in the crack/fissure where you have applied pressure and directed flow (or pain).
If there is not a goblet available, then you will need to make one on that spot or where it hurts intensely, and do so with a limpet shell for the tool used under that area; avoiding leaving without doing something; immediately introduce a delicate instrument of curvature into the extremity.
If you cannot cover it there, then increase the disruption a little bit, and if you see phlegm flowing out from that spot which was previously treated with sulphur triple distilled vinegar (i.n.), separate them tightly now.
If the stone is within one of them (the bladder), push it to the mouth of the bladder, and place your hand over it there; also lift up a small amount of water; apparently they are pains from diseases.
If there is much pain, it'thy ignorance that you insert this great limb into the groin area; here two causes may arise: either because it remains or due to continuous urine distillation from there, thus not being completely secured in its place for both reasons.
May administer removal from within that has been brought out (expulsio), or in the case of a break inside where hooks are inserted to extract it, do so until taken out through pressure plates (extriga).
Therefore, when you have completed your treatment, fill the womb of our seeds (the body) with Aloe and Dragon'sin essence, and strengthen it thusly. And apply pressure on that cloth inflamed with oil and vinegar or water foam, so that the application stops bleeding.
Return the intestine above the navel on the patient's abdomen and do not release it into the third day.
When that air escapes, apply water and oil to the affected area, taking care to do so with liniment or unguents inside until it is healed.
May you if in the field inflame an abscess with cautery to soften and dissolve it, as when your sanctum is congealed like urine within its bladder (and through which excretion of urine is prohibited), then insert the thread into the field and extract that sanc, if Rheumatism provokes corruption in both the bladder and body putrefaction.
Here returns the water and soil (or mud) moistened with rainwater or sea salt, which are used for all kinds of healing as long as they contribute to making sickness cured within it.
During all of the healing process, when you are adjusting and applying the drugs that have been paused at this location.
If the stone is small and located in the bladder's meat, it remains there, and urine extraction is prohibited; thus healing this illness requires immediate attention to prevent progression towards another stage, which has been accused of being a continuation or worsening—and you have already drained out the fluid. Now take hold of an iron knife for drainage from here:
From outside the body cavity, gout settles in a pipe (or stone).
Return your faithful servant and place it on that stone just above the bladder pelly, to ensure it does not return there again.
And insert the needle into the vein quickly so that as soon as the piercer enters it will go down to that spot. And turn the cautery in your hand over that area little by little until one of them makes a hole, and at that moment, the urine is expelled.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return your hand over what is broken down from the bone of the separated part above the groove where it pierces (the urethra), which has been cracked open and its exit for urine, at this point the prostate becomes healthy.
If this cure is not within your reach for any reason that prevents you from doing so, then apply a poultice immediately to the bone, and another poultice below it (on the skin). When you place it above that stone in between the bones of his legs, Return that outside (or) remove it outwardly. Return the ligaments and cleanse the swolthy sac with it, which is made in the dirt.
It is not necessary to use hemp thread immediately after the piercing of the perineum, but rather until it returns to its place and pulls back into position; another thread above only when removing the original one (once the hemp has been removed), as then the coccyx returns to its location and draws itself back in.
When it is necessary for you to lift the thigh from below (to assess or manipulate), then raise the penis to the parts undernethy, and return your touch as directed by those who have spoken with us here.

The text in question describes what seems to be a hernia with an emphasis on fluid accumulation within the abdomen that puts pressure on the intestines housed therein; this condition is colloquially referred to as "abdominal water." The description outlines how excess moisture, or humidity ("agua" in Spanish), which should normally be contained by bodily walls (possibly referring to abdominal wall integrity and its role in containing the intestines
The text seems to discuss the presence of moisture within a certain portion where natural fluid (likely referring to intestinal contents or peritoneal fluid) accumuls in preparation for digestion; it is situated between the abdominal wall and intestines, highlighting that this area has been previously identified as having excessive fluids. The term "tart" here suggests a solidified form of moisture—possibly an old or fibrous accumulation within these layers (perhaps indicating chronic inflammation leading to tissue scarring). This description is indicative of understanding and identifying the clinical presentation associated with fluid infiltration into abdominal structures,
Here the text explains that this type of hernia is related to a process causing fluid discharge into the intestines ("genetius" being an old term for small intestine or bowel). The accumulated material, when pressured by body movements (implied as "ad aquells es efundunda," which might mean they are forced out with motion), and potentially exac0urated through percussion—a technique in physical examination where tapping the abdomen to check for fluid build-up ("percuscio fayta") can help detect such discharg

And it may be a specific affliction on this kind and over the other bones; and you will insert the catheter into the urethra, position them above these parts below, extract that from the bladder neck, unfasten the sling of vessels, bind together those which are bound apart by it, and incise through what is left to be extracted there.
Then if it is that flesh has already solidified therein (at the site of swelling or inflammation), then remove and insert what you have extracted from there.

The phrase in question appears to be Latin, and it pertains to the treatment of intestinal protrusion
The phrase translates to: "When this hernia happens due to a section that extends out over the abdomen as part of the intestine's misguidance, when these bulges reach among themselves." This sentence describes an instance where there is protrusion or displacement within the body cavity (abdominal), likely referring to internal organs like parts of the intestines. The text seems rooted in medieval medical understanding and would have been describing a clinical observation with some degree of technical detail, indicative of humoral theories prevalent during that time period where an imbalance
This protrusion (hernia) occurs either from the womb or excretion thereof; and these entrails are affected for various reasons: due to physical impact, concussion ("percussio"), thrusting force ("saut," often implying violent action), loud noise potentially causing distress in tissues ("clamor"), elevated pressure of some cause severe (possibly referring to conditions like ascites where fluid accumulency raises intra-abdominal pressures or due to straining, possibly associated with obesity - "semblantz"). Here the author is explaining that there are several potential factors leading to hernias which may involve physical trauma ("percuss
The statement translates as: "When the humors are expelled due to distention of the womb and do not quickly settle back in place for long periods, they become stuck within each other inside this vessel [presumably referring to an artery or vein], causing what is known by various terms." In contemporary medical language, it refers to ascites where accumulated fluid (humors) due to liver disease or blockage of lymph vessels leads to distention and may eventually leak into the abdominal cavity. The term "apostema" historically related not only to a specific type but also generically referred to infiltration by blood,
E the patient'dict is when it occurs through one of its sections (the section refers to some aspect or stage in treatment), and at that time various symptoms appear on the seemingly protected area, and this comes from inflammation within the hernia/budel; all these conditions occur simultaneously with their body parts.

Translation: You understand that castration is forbidden by our law; however, we remember it here in this text for two reasons only — one of which pertains to the knowledge of physicians when dealing with such cases (as they are aware), and another reason being if there's a necessity due to other animals whose use or presence may benefit us similarly as horses do.
And so it is said that castration occurs in two ways: either through withdrawal (atrissio), or by tearing apart of the section (fissura a seccio).
When it is caused by suction, the way of operation we must perform is to make the creature submerged in water tail downward until their moistening and straightening are achieved and they hang vertically. Return those things into your hand so that they become resolution and do not appear again from handling.

Exit from twins or fetuses of many. You know that the jaws move with habit, and some times three or four times a day they may become strange and tighten up; perhaps it is due to natural causes, but life itself can be troublesome sometimes.
When those things are considered—even if they have been expanded and there is a second companion involved, separated by these intermediaries (possibly referring to instruments or tools), initially for natural expulsion from the womb as part of childbirth, and subsequently with some rest periods in between each session:
If the childbirth is difficult for them and they come to us with concerns about unnatural figures, then care for these aspects as we have discussed.

Of caring for those ulcers that come about by chance.
The abscesses that come down in the lower region and large intestine, which arise from behind or within one of the parts:
It is an opening or ulceration (a "fistula" refers to a tube-like
When that connection is ancient and permits the outflow of moist or sticky vapors (poyroura), and some passages through these openings are present;
Those penetrating things are guarded by this fluid that the patient excretes through it and for expulsion, some also employ its emesis (vomiting), and others suffer from these fluids; hereby using their own vomitus for egression purposes.
From those fistulas some have wandered into the cavity, and entered into the meat of the urethra; they also enter at the junction of the thighs and in/into the navel area.
When the fluid (or pus) in a penetrating or non-penetrating abscess enters the belly button, it is that you place your spit therein and introduce subtle erasers of clay or iron into the fistula when no tendernthy disorder occurs.
If there is tightness in that area, they enter subtly within the place where you feel pressure or pain inside your body.
If you do not feel that particular one in total nor proceed with any cause of indigestion or worms and windiness, as we have said before, then you understand it does not penetrate, and thus take care of yourself.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or the urethra, it signifies that I must treat the patient'dict output urine from there and prevent its escape so as to ensure that this location is under medical care.
May it penetrate within the joint of the thigh or into the bone and inflict pain throughout the circuit, so that this person is in danger of having something enter inside if not carefully checked before entering the bone, resulting in additional pain on departure; such treatment will be immediately applied; there'dict nothing beneficial here nor does it solidify.
In all those penetrating ulcers there is not a cure at hand, and the treatment by doctors will work on which they have firmly fixed their attention.

May there be times when the flow of phlegm enters between you and your patient's cavity while inside them, then it is necessary for that person to use cauterizing instruments like fire or acute medicine; such treatments adjust their bad habits well: this leads to detoxification of those congested channels, and absorption of excess phlegm.

La cause here is to administer one of three remedies: or that which cauterizes the ailment we have mentioned; or else after restoring its cavity for so you may enter and treat those parts, preventing any intestine from coming out; avoid injections as they might rupture contained bowels within it. Furthermore, apply what remedy we've stated if very strong is to heal quickly, stretch the wound or use another sharp instrument of acute extremity for crusting these fistulae that are present inside the section; and perform the restoration of all parts affected by such pus above its exit point from below. If poultice applied externally does not solidify it, then rupture may occur in the abscess within the buttocks area due to malady exacsiting through there, leading for blood seeping outwardly; and if purge is produced by such pus coming forth outside its natural exit point from below. And in some cases the fistula is closed according to this methodology: when you insert a tool into the fistula, and it's within the belly button area on the skin above/below (belly) and at the edge of the buttocks, then take said tool with forceps-like preparation needles as follows:
And insert into that outer covering of the field, and attempt to insert into the foot within which continuation is taking place for this purpose (concupiscence).

Return care until it is solidified and healed.
If the drainage of the fistula is not penetrating, then you must make it so in any way that suits your preparation, but do not insert anything into where there should be no incision; and apply to whatsothy have prepared inside as a healing measure.
The form of spume (pus) through which the fistula is pierced: its curvature causes acute pain and the other division does not cause it to be necessary, thus they come as often as needed.

May if the points are not tightened in those places due to their moisture and softness, then take a rough cloth or waxed thread or linen fabric, fasten these around them, remove it carefully with tweezers at the point of incision, sprinkling some ash there during preparation; that they be kept for use as cauterizing agents when needed. Return those for care so that they may heal within them themselves now.
If the belly does not swell upwards (indicating edema or distension), cris-coil it in the place where there is slight biting, and wash with the water that is already present in the colon which contributes to its outward expansion when the abdomen expands.
If the hemorrhoids are drained from the buttocks, then their cause is phlegm (excessive mucus), and you grasp those with your finger or tongue, insert them back inside where they were before when healed, applying care to ensure that these are moistened by what we have said within which should be cured.
And for those who incise with skill (suture), as done according to this technique: take up the thread firmly and insert it through that needle already in place on top of each piece above; wrap around threads from outside into pieces wrapped tight, transversely at first time. Then sew open wounds newly created by thrusting the point backward with a swift motion along the length (and breadth) of this cut area and secure thread firmly to prevent further damage or deterioration—seal quickly using these methods:

Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May the humors that are in the body' extrications be withdrawn like a swarm of flies hovering over the head, neck, chest, belly, waist, or limbs; they appear similar to these creatures among members.
Even when considering some illnesses for treatment, such practice allows a pause in thought and guidance regarding other diseases.
When discussing simple diseases of the head, when recalling complex conditions will arrive at their consideration in the third chapter.
So when the pain in the head is simple and not a fracture, then consider: if it's due to brain movement or appearance, at that moment touch the cervical gently but firmly just enough; do not delay your action, extract as much of the worm causing catharsis (likely referring to intestinal parasites) from there. Extract according to its quantity if no other cause prohibits further bloodletting, mostly when this sickness has been in residence for a long time and shows little signs.
And if it is a flawbition from the contrary of the affected party, and you must protect the groin area against overeating and heavy foods (wine and such), do so accordingly.
May if from mildness you prevent any cause, then it will be lessened in food and not approach meat or drink.
When applying pressure on the patient's skin with an applied hot or cold poultice (ointment/vapor), if it causes ulceration due to putrefaction, continue treatment by adding more oil dressing so that healing is effective in this medium wherein his wound becomes sealed.
May it be certain that the application of cauterization is safe; if so, pause over the ground (the affected area), provided that the dust which was recommended for after-care has not recently changed and the air remains as before.
If the air has changed and become cold, then rest on hot compresses within so that it is healed.
If the child is large or has insufficient space and appearance (implying perhaps too many clothes for their size), and if their lips are not adjusted properly to breathe through, then fix those as instructed in how they should be stitched together.
May it be that the child has been discovered between bone and flesh, and not restrained by you but only with a small suspensor; then attend to that part which was found, apply medicine therein as directed for corruption: capsules and forms of meat (grains) that cause swelling in them, command the malady to consume these foods until it is composed.
If there is rot in the bone and it does not stick to the bone, then cut off all this putrefied matter with water (presumably using some form of cautery or removal tool), and take care that no more remains.
If in these diseases an artery or vein where blood flows could become blocked and not be healed by medicine, then investigate the artery (and if you find that it has been damaged), cut into that with a sponge or ligature; and if necessary to provoke what we have said does not cause discomfort, perform cauterization where the blood vessel is already severed.
If these pains are simple and small, then the cause of them is chilliness; thus make powder on those areas until this morning' extraneous moisture clears them away.
The main sentence translation: The purpose of the poultice is this: take one part of sesame oil split in advance, two parts of dragon'dictum not yet extinguished (probably some form of medicinal herb or powder), all mixed and crumbled together; it forms a complete paste, which must be applied inside where clothing adheres to the skin while lying down for good constriction underneath until fully absorbed. And when coagulated with honey from the same dragon'dictum, this is completed.

And now this operation on the great humors is performed when it is decided that they are stopped over these and have not been recently disturbed in their sources, wherein the air has not changed.
If the air has been altered, and especially in summer time, you may not understand where to place this powder, so take care of those things we have mentioned before; thus rest these dry substances above which they give a potting effect when placed on such areas (implying that it refers back to joint pain or inflammation), or pause the flour and water mixture from bread dough inside where hands can be put in for massage, taking care of those things we have discussed earlier; furthermore take care of these remedies while they are healing.
If you have a bone fracture in the body, and it is small, then extract water through movement.
And direct the treatment of skull fractures as poisonous (or venomous, depending on interpretation).
Of the diseases of the colon (or "plagues" in older terminology referring generally to
When the worms infest in the colon (or "plagues" as they were referred to), there is no difference in treatment for it, and when dealing with a simple case of intestinal parasites at the head end (this could refer to an area nearer or associated with one' extrinsic part like appendix issues – although this interpretation requires some speculation due to archa
When nerves or an artery are present in the colon (which may indicate more serious conditions), it is not simply about choosing between treatments; rather, one must avoid any care that causes violent stoppage of blood flow to these structures—do so gently as a healer and explain with clear intentions why this action should be taken away from nerves and the artery. No pressure is applied to any cause of total madness; the substance of nerves keeps it alive in the brain, which they place at the source of all body parts.
If water is needed for healing with medicinal waters, then some of it will be poured into a pot (potentially filled with either rose or no-rose oil), and heat when washing with this water along with other stones used according to these instructions, together wrap the moisture.
If the child is large, administer stitches or clamp down their lips, and take care that these are applied while they heal inside where possible.
If there is depth or pain in the lower area operated upon by cutting and piercing it herein (i.thy), then make a puncture at that place for draining of pus, if necessary.
If in the child there is an inserted artery and they have succeeded in making a flow of blood (arterial puncture), then separate or dry out that one if necessary; otherwise, cauterize it to cause effusion towards the outside.
May you have inserted the vertebrae of the spondylosis or all, and thus saved the veins in the neck; once done, adjust your lips to the bone seam with suture without touching that area; carefully restore it back to its natural shape, ensdicturing tightness for structure through dressings over several days until healing.
May if the child in their bones experiences pain before birth, then you will strike that area; and if there are fragments of bone within them, extract all those pieces which you can from them; but if it is not possible for you to enter inside, let the fetus solidify (become flesh), separate it out, and remove its entrails.
If the child is new lately, then grind over that very dust which has been recommended for you. If there is an ulcer in the patient'se body and they remember to take that water (medicinal liquid), then heal that wound with it at his own place of residence.
If it is from a lance or cottle impact, and at times you measure the depth, then also consider that when wind enters through the malady into it; understand that the swelling consists of dirt (implying pus). Thus, realize that what seems to be living matter in this condition may actually not have life.
If there is no depth and the patient has recently suffered from itching in their chest or belly area (the first sentence suggests a condition related to excess moisture within), then pause until the initial hour after applying ointment, without tightening that which prevents the body fluid from being deep inside of them and returning to the heart. After this treatment for any ongoing itching throughout the day, stop doing so (translation with some interpretative liberty due to archaic language structure):
If the ointment is not at your disposal, then rest in the bath filled with cold water collected from below ground level to let out watery secretions that come up; and make the gout sleep on top of this muddy water so that its flowing essence can be adjusted within.
May you have passed through three days or more without spasm in the groin nor malady pain of heart and chest constriction, and use then other beneficial measures for that patient; thus care is taken with his cure and another form of treatment until he becomes healthy.
May it be that the healing of him/her is postponed, and even now locked in rest, know well that a fistula has formed; therefore attend to this with your care.
If the child has pierced through space or skin and it's simple on the surface of the flesh or buttocks, then care for that which is preceding stitching if large, or powder if small.
May there be pain in the bone already and open joints present (already inflamed or separated), then use a lancet to extract those pains if they are apart from each other. If they are not separated, let them be led out that the vermin may be extracted from them.
From other accidents that occur in other body parts, restoration is achieved by the fluid we have mentioned beforehand.
From abdominal disorders/afflictions.
The discomgy that you experience in your belly is great, small, or wandering.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When a small disruption is caused by other means (likely mishandling or additional factors), making their reduction difficult, unless you prevent them from entering your body and becoming engorged with bodily fluids, then your breast may swell.
So that the best interruption occurs, for in that place it is difficult to reduce the hernia, just as with those special arts described hereinabove.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And you understand that there are four methods of treatment for abdomen issues, and may some surgeries be common ones used in treatments of other diseases on the body.
When two other stitches communicate with each other or themselves in the abdominal stitching, yes but perhaps also between them within that very same stitching of the belly.
When each of you is exposed or declared, it is recommended (to do).
So when the patient is small and suffers from some cause of a hernia due to it, making reduction difficult becomes one of two possible reasons: either because of diminutive size (reduplication) or if the hernia has become inflamed due to cold air exposure.
And when the fluid enters, at that time cover what you have submerged in water alone for your cloth and swab moistened with vinegar or sponge dampened by running water (or cumin, pepper), to aid in dissolving the inflammation within.
And when joint pain occurs due to moisture in the body, and water alone is better for resolving inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the protruding part with water from which herbs have been soaked; thus being cured by a little cause within it all at once.
If you manage to free the patient from this treatment, divide the rupture into small parts using an instrument with which wounds have been dressed.
The initial text in English would be translated as follows line by line:
From the tool, its form is as follows:
One sharp division of the limb, and another not acute, and a subtlety that is not in relation to bone structure; for both divisions are blunt or oblique at one point only.
And when the vermin is increased and comes out of the intestine, then make its reduction according to its own form in its proper place, if it'thy at all possible thereabouts; this would be better for you.
When the disruption is wide and it's in the lower part of the belly, then you make a space for the hernia with your hands on their backs, and place cushions under them where they stand; if it's below the stomach area, hold their head and shoulders securely using pillows.
Even if the disruption is in one of the parts of the abdomen, then pause your understanding and consideration immediately so that whatever creature (implicitly referring to an intestinal matter) inside can be expelled or addressed accordingly.
And when you administer it into large and departing pains,
In the small pains you have prepared for me (and), take care that your servant is between your five palms, which holds together the total disruption in their mouth and adjusts their lips here to where they are sewing some cause with another as directed by them.
Here's the line-by-line translation of this medieval medical treatise text:
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And if they are small needles moving inward into the flesh; and large ones difficult to enter through the vein, for that reason they move towards subtlety and coarseness.
And where the needle is fixed in any of the patient' extramand parts that were previously prepared for injection, to ensure that the flesh does not burst apart and dirt (pus) does not accumulate before its solidification.
No surgimiento of surgeries be extended for that the patient is not prevented from healing.
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English:
These surgical needles are carefully placed in the small wounds; it is sufficient to use either a needle or thread for their stitching.
Might the second suture be common: and it is that you tenderly apply a needle to the four extremities, from the chest downwards through both thighs using an appropriate pin in terms of delicacy and thickness.
When the needle has entered these four extremities (hands and feet), reduce the needle of that surgeon' extricated piece by which you are holding, in such a way that the wound cavity rises up to its separated part on the ground, so that suturing with this cloth-bound thread occurs as usual.
When there is a pause in any of our stitches about the size of this limb'supreme,
This stitch is for men.
Et such a suture has been done by the cobbler wherein there was an illness in their belly, which consisted of the major part of a palm (a significant amount), and it came out due to disturbanthy surrounding intestines that were two palms wide from each other within the stomach's cavity; hence he has reduced what had been for hours.
The child is solidified in the spaces of fifteen days or less, and it heals that part, and apply moist heat for motion sickness purposes, as time goes by (in their disposition).
E other doctors had not healed it; and by miracle fire, they could not cure that wax which was in the place where no treatment nor medicine touched it, but might occasionally relieve two visits a day with water of honey inside while foc sanitizes.
May you direct two types of surgical thread according to Paracelsus' accounting.
When you begin stitching the neck, and insert the needle from the lower forearm to the upper thigh.
And when the needle enters into the navel and in that region, as far down as all of it goes; lay siege to the tip where you inserted the needle earlier today; then penetrate into the other end of this part entered yesterday at its own extremity.
When you have pain in that area, then make another examination of the same kind between the upper and lower parts of this section here; let the outside portion outlined therein also be explored with an inserted needle into the other extremity of this division.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When it is necessary for that which has entered through your entrance (possibly referring to an infectious agent or some form of illness) to enter into the cistern in the extremity of the navel, where all else enters within you.
Here begins with the side of this body, and takes that away from its extent at the hip joints on the other side, thrusting into those hips where it previously went in before, taking out what was therein; and also removes whatever is taken out by means of a needle inserted through the coccyx.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And give them both some relief and another remedy within what you have done, according to that which they need most for their restoration as per your judgment.
The sum total of this suture work is that you sew the skin with which hairs grow (hair), making a stitch at the part of the extremity of the coda, and let it rest until it's completed.
May the second kind of suture proper to it be what Gualia speaks and recommends herein; this is that you sew up the half-strength flesh which heals his, adding all parts necessary for one'dictory part according to nature; applying another limb’s extremity onto your own similar extremity in turn.
When you hold the needle at your designated area of departure, and push that into the parting in that spot, taking turns with both ends of the catheter; rotate the needle so that it enters the partition between those two endpoints on the catheter.
When those bones are turned around them, and pierce the parts inside into two divisions of each leg position in opposition to their sides.
This stitching is better than ordinary sewing for the purpose of rememberance, and it follows this method which they recall using beforehand.
This is the speech of Gallien (Galien being a name likely derived from Greek or Roman phys
It may serve as a guide or explanation of surgery, where the belly'sincis are rectified using two needles; this allows you to insert your fingers into these at several points, and begin with inserting an inserted (or sewing) needle in those places which surgeons cut along during their incision process within our bodies.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine' extramural location (abdomen), it is easier to sew than at other locations within the belly.
May the art of healing medicine be judgment for other illnesses.
The cause is when you complete the recent chore done for their sick body today because the air has altered that, and return the intestine (and cushion) to its cavity; then pause over that corporeal dust.
If the air has altered the humors, then pause on that spot where you enter now and make hard leather and clogs for the fields; they shall be fortified with iron and glass as far as possible while curing other illnesses within which one is healed.
If you do not have the medicines present at this very moment, then rest upon that which is immediately available and start applying it gently, allowing two days of use with what you have on hand as guidance; provided during these times when pests are simple to manage without additional remedies.
If you fear that the vermin may spread infection to the main limbs, then cover them with wet linen or rasped oil, and leave it there for a while until they reach between the joints where bones meet and around the sinews.
If there is pain or putrefaction in your intestines, they move forward continuously; and if the inflammation has reached its cavity, then it becomes blackish as blood through that aperture, mostly when excretion occurs within the cavity of yours.
Be aware that what is of gross intestine healing is better than what is in the fine bowels, indicating a recognition of the importance of maintaining healthy gut function compared to issues within the finer structures or parts of the body such as small intestines (budels subtils).
It is difficult for the intestine that they are calling "goner" to receive healing from outside help due to several reasons: (1) there are many veins in it and their size in this; (2) its subtility, as per its nature which relates to nerve structures.
If what you process from the dirt is linen (material), then obtain that which has just been made and with your straightened hand reduce those swellings immediately, whereby these are reduced by pressing them down manually.
If space has been passed through and black or dark pus has come out therein, then press that faithful piece of flesh over the spot where it is discolored, in order to expel putrid blood from the vessels within.
Here applies the fluid that is another of those ligaments, and places two extremities of the hanging part of the limb near the ground floor here so that on you it can be applied for strapping or removal from the brace made with this material.
Remember when you have diseases in the intestine (budel).
When you have caused a disruption in the intestine and it is sought to restore it back into its cavity (so that nothing comes out of it), thus come those who were previously plagued within their abdomen due to blunt impact from lance, where they resided as detritus or ruins at the seventh part of the stomach - these individuals are old and infested with a fistula (open wound/ulceration), suffering from treatment actions and wind turbulence.
And now you apply the treatment to him who has not yet been healed within their sickness, may it subtly expel that which is at the focus of health and stabilize the location.
Here you have already secured the place tightly above where an evil event occurs in their belly; and not allowing any such malign accident to enter through the places they put food or drink into, and between bathing times when exerthy is exerted on them.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And when experienced practitioners place a large cautery on it (the intestine or hernia), as per this methodology: take hold of these cauldrons, and adjust the patient'thy lips with them; holding that in their mouths tightly. When they clench their teeth around those instruments, attach to them firmly without being detached.
And rest at another place if necessary and continue making more forms as needed according to the amount of all the swelling.
Reduce and apply it to the swelling, and break those attachments within the hernia inside so that the hernia is healed; without causing harm to any part of its structure.
And it is possible that the intestine has been pierced by a sharp object below which comes from the patient's animal companions; place your hand on these field extremities of the intestines you have, detach them carefully and apply this same finger to securely hold those edges together with needles and threads attached to it. Now reduce that disruption.
This technique of sewing is not our only way, but rather a method based on trust and hope.
If the child is large and wide, especially if it's in one of the smaller intestines, then they are not immediately curable here but require subtlety, and there will be no complete cure for them at all.
Of treatment for ulcers and fistulas.
You understand that all children and apostema when they become olden or aged, and it gets ulcers which are not consolidated nor healed by a full arm brace for any time without falling apart; in every part where there is one, we call this fistula.
E fistula according to truth is a tightly woven, hard, white thread in which there is no pain and with which itching occurs similarly when one suffers from gout; therefore they call this the "itchy thread." So they insert that into their bodies. (Here 'itchy' refers metapthyically rather than literally to an irritating or uncomfortable feeling, similar in concept but not literal translation.)
In dampness, which causes sweating, and as for moisture that is lost in a few hours. Some moisture is moved here, and it's scant, thick, and subtle.
And have shown all those causes and their symptoms are part of the healing in this division.
Once you have made an understanding of the treatment for the opening (fistula) which is caused by operation, it becomes clear how to proceed with care and healing.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Therefore, this one among these ulcers is from the diseases difficult to cure and does not receive care or attention; it demands work and lack of knowledge.
If there is any depth to the ulcer that does not reach these places which are mentioned herein, and you await its healing, and wish to understand it, then take either arrows or iron tools, and if the ulcer follows a straight course, examine this area with your own eyes.
May it be that if the fistula is twisted, then investigate what subtle lead under its own body will elevate and curve to rectify the twisting.
If there is an abhorrent ulcer present, it is not within your power to attempt on them.
Now apply the poultice for him with his own pills and run water from them through it; this moisture will flow to other applications of theirs, downward in each direction.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When you have stood upon all these causes and see them clearly established beforehand, then go to the treatment according to your confidence: for it may be that what has come about is an apparent fistula near or in joint space, distant from juncture points of bone, nerve, artery, vein, or one of those locations which belong to you and have been disclosed.
When you dry up the fistula as directed by its nature, and maintain what is present in that filtration area which has formed from decayed or corrupted flesh (or body parts), including any originating within the carnal cavity or segment of limbs/bodily appearance—and take care for it while being healed.
May it be if the fistula is of deep lengthiness and secondarily sealed, cover that which can be inserted into its depth as much as your arm'dictions allow; cleanse all his rotten bones with encapsulated acute medicines, and insert those capsules inside the cavity of the fistula, which you have comprehended at arms.
When certain humors enter for a few days into the cavity of the fistula caused by decay, medicine sharply dissolves all that enters therein.
And restore that which is inside with wax, as it generates healthy flesh within until healed.
May it not be healed by this water, then apply treatment as recommended previously.
May as well if the cause of fistula is blood or you must certify it, then inquire about that and its dry state according to what we have recommended; do not prohibit any cause related to veins or nerves or major body parts from being discussed like this.
May it be that your bones have been discovered and there is any decay or blackness within, then take care of the affected area wherein the corruption resides entirely; attend to this water which embodies you inside so that healing may occur.
If it is not healed and the brace does not help as before, then you will understand that you have not yet reached total cure; hence observe carefully on this limb both its refinement and purification at every stage of treatment until now, and restore what has been lost.
And if it heals, take honey; but if not, then understand that the corruption is deep within the body and has not been resolved yet; hence you must address it there as well.
If the bone is rotten or can be pulled out with it, then now you may use those small forceps which I have agreed upon for this purpose.
If there is a stone in the bones, then you must carefully extract all of them without causing any harm to yourself or relying on your strength alone.
May you encounter any counter-effect of the moisture, but in their ignorance have no fear or mistake; therein proceed to examine those ligaments and bones if they are here, and break them down.
May you not be ready with the bones of your hour (hips), then rest on a soft bed and let it warm that which makes the bed warmer for those bones, ensuring they are not solidified or constricted, keeping in mind what has been inserted during your operation.
Having feared under the pot of boiling oil above or in an Egyptian cote submerged below (in fatty substances) or among some fats from which their ligaments are separated and whose bones have been shattered by these attachments, they must be removed.
May if there is a great toe with the bones of the knee or thighs similar to those herein described, and when it has been ruined from this place so much that only its face remains, then after such damage for as long time as necessary, use restoration tools on it just enough until no remaining blackness (darkness/corruption) is behind nor deformity.
May it be that what has already been ruptured is a great part of the body and damage to the bone marrow has occurred; at this point, it becomes necessary to close both (the damaged areas) completely inside where they have come together due to corruption, so as for them to heal properly.
And you recommend that they go into their thighs to soothe and assist in your operation.

And so you discover another wound and continue to carefully insert the bone piece by piece, restoring what remains of it with medicine from there, solidifying healing until completely inserted within a palm's width, extracting that which is in its marrow, and restore it using medicines; this consolidates his recovery.
No iteration in the operation of leg and foot is necessary except for the disposition of the patient'dicts fluids and their tolerance to pain and fear of death, for they act throughout all hours due to excessive bowel movements after syncopal events.

May if the bone is protruding in the joint and you tighten that according to this treatment: hold onto it with a strong thread, command someone else to stretch that out on its extremity; pull back the first thick thread from where you have tied it; position that over the flesh of which the bone sticks out, extending the tissue outside so that you can saw through there and remove the flesh as desired in order not to lead the flesh.
When one uses a sword or tablet immediately afterward (when it is permissible not to use the scalpel and thus prevent further corruption of the flesh), then:

If there is a deformation in the joint, open that deformed joint and cut away the bone from other parts of it.
If it is a continuous decay of joints due to deterioration (corruption), then it'dict not by chance but rather because they are weakened (engineering).
If the corruption is in the chest or breastbone, it'sin easy; but if you seek out wherein said corruption appears to thee and remove that part therewith, following any manner thou findeth possible for thyself, and apply those things unto him, he shall be made whole as long as no contrary action of veins or nerves takes place.
Be aware of the instruments and tools used for setting these bones according to their situation, as well as their size, bulkiness or delicacy, fineness/size, smallness/largeness, hardness, rarity; so that you prepare all types of surgical instrument necessary for this operation.

Secondly regarding bone fracture in the head.
The spices of fractures are motes (impetuous or sudden), and their figures are various, the causes being distinctive: some a fall from space, which enters into the cranium where it is felt as pain in the head; others when they pierce through bone, entering flesh but not passing beyond to go undernethy's skull cap; this type of fracture injury is called dislocation.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the jawbone is separated into two parts, then apply extension to those parts inside until possible for it (the patient) to swallow.
If you have caused discomfort in the mouth that requires separation (implying dental issues), then tighten those parts from which you hope it will come out through silver or gold filament or softness; and place pressure on the broken jawbone, as well as over the doubled cloth wrap, applying a single finger along its length according to how your garment fits. Do this carefully so that nothing is destroyed in the process.
When commanded by the humors that must rest and calmness is brought about in him, cease consuming his food slowly (i.dict to drink it gradually).

Movements made while the player's shoulder blade is broken: Here, someone describes a situation where an individual continues to move with their injured scapula (shoulder blade), categorizing such movements into three types of actions or patterns likely related to rehabilitation techniques. The sentence suggests that despite being immobilized due to the fracture, there are still ways in which movement can occur around this injury site for recovery purposes –
When the shoulder blade is broken: It's separated into two parts that do not join together – and it requires restoration in these joint spaces, or alternatively, if there are nail-like structures present (possibly referring to small bone fragments), they must be addressed within those locations; otherwise, recovery may prove challenging. If the break is complete without pieces remaining joined at any point—or what could referentially translate as a clean fracture with no splinters – it might facilitate healing processes in that specific space (the shoulder blade).
When the operation on that takes place where the bone is fractured, it is that you make two servants present: one holds his hand as support for the broken clavicle and the other extends their chest to this divided area.
And place the bone back into its sockets as it is formed by what has been broken, and not in a small or indented manner.
If indigestion extends, then slow down the stimulation of your belly through sheets or woolen clothes according to what you need; raise and contract your chest and compress with pressure as directed by me.

The translated line reads: "And when it is broken in the place of it — and fractured therein—it's not known but by touch, as per your guidance for preparation you will shape and reduce that fragment according to its natural form within all means at your disposal." In a medical context related to spinal injury or surgery on the vertebrae (vertebris), this implies careful manual handling of fractured bone fragments is required. The goal would be to mold them back into their proper alignment, which may involve some degree of artistry and engineering-like precision given that it mentions "total means at your disposal," suggesting various techniques or tools could potentially be used in the process for reconstruction after a fracture has occurred – possibly involving cervical vertebrae (vertebris), as indicated by 'C' from Capit
The line translates as: "Apply pressure on the spot where molasses and wax are applied, stop at the double layer of cloth; apply gentle touch with a delicate stone slate from the altar according to what is taken by your spatula—either all or perhaps just one." In this context involving medical care for injuries such as vertebra fractures (vertebris), it seems that there's an emphasis on applying specific treatments with precision, likely referring to a process of bone setting. The term 'spatula,' which might denote the instrument used by healthcare providers during manual therapy or examination post-injury—could refer here either literally as in spinal manipulation

Of bone breakage treatment at the wrist." (Note: The phrase "restauracio de la fractura del piat
The wrist bone sometimes gets broken out in the warmth of its place, and may have to use hands that are compressed or manipulated thereupon (to treat). Here they refer possibly to manual therapy techniques involving compression on the affected extremities—likely thumbs due to context. The treatment mentioned involves handling these parts with pressure which might be aimed at reducing pain or aligning a fracture, common approaches in pre-modern medicine before modern interventions were
From the mishaps when it gets cold out there they declare that limbs and joints may experience severe pain, difficulty in movement, coughing up phlegm (which might indicate chills or fever associated with inflammation), weakness of legs ("fort leu"), nausea ("vomeys sanc" - a term likely referring to vomiting due to the discomfort from injury). This is said particularly when bones have been broken and there's clear suffering as felt by those present, without any attempt at concealing these symptoms. Here they emphasize that pain should not be ignored or hidden in case of skeletal fractures; it’s a reminder for prompt medical attention according to medieval sensibthy belief systems where bodily signs were closely linked with health status and required
For the treatment of it being that bone has been fractured (presumably referring back to a wrist or hip situation from earlier sentences), they suggest: rest with heavy blankets over their two shoulders, placing pillows between the shoulder blades; and adjusting muscles as well as aligning thoracic spine curvature in such ways that are feasible according to current knowledge. Here medieval practitioners would advocate for gentle care during treatment—possibly a form of restorative body position or simple immobilization technique (akin to modern traction) before the bone heals back into its proper shape, indicating an understanding from their era that physical manipulation and supportive devices could aid in recovery. The text reflects not only care for skeletal integrity but also a concern with maintaining spinal alignment—which was considered important even then (though our current knowledge of orthopedics has since evolved). These methods suggest some level of practical wisdom, likely built upon centuries or millennia of observational medicine.
Here is the translation line by line:
If it is necessary to provoke the dismemberment of that which corrupts or causes pain in the location you have touched with your finger and needle, then remove the impurity (emplastre) from there immediately; if needed for a time period, reduce its size according to what suits healing on this individual'dictor. And adjust it so as not to allow that which is injured within him back into his cavity while maintaining strictures necessary for recovery.

When the coasts are broken, or when there is a need for restoration in these areas—here begins our discussion on beach rehabilitation
You understand that a fracture of the coast does not occur in large masses but rather where their two parts are separated; and from these extremities, removed to those joints which have become calcified—these bony areas need addressing due to them being softened by water. Here we examine how beach injuries differ when involving broken limbs versus fractured coastlines: Upon learning of him/her not being bewitched by his/her feelings, I realize that he/she is seeking for truth about himself/herself.
The restoration shall be as the patient can bear it according to their ability, entering when they are ready and applying bandaging or strapping where necessary on the broken bone(s), if required by that individual's capacity.
If the fracture of the spine is declining towards the parts where it has broken down, you will experience sharp pain and puncturing sensation therein, similar to when one cries, and for that reason your clothes should be removed; difficulty in breathing (panting), cough, hoarseness, vomiting of phlegm - all these symptoms are indicative of a difficult treatment.

The translation for the line provided, which appears to be in Old Spanish or early modern European vernacdict related to bone healing of the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae
Some days after a broken rib or backbone bones have healed and resemble those of the lumbar vertebrae (the "dos"), then apply compression to them, indicating an early method for immobilizing fractures in medieval times likely aimed at supporting recovery. The translation captures both the treatment approach taken during that period as well as a sense of urgency or routine care required after such When water has cooled and you wish to know if they will heal or not; when their spirits are soothed and calmed down that it seems deadly motionless in them - at which point the bones must be carefully compressed, but without further extension nor strengthening of those limbs. If there is pain present within these restrained movements using needles (probably as a form of early acupuncture or palpation), you understand that they are not healing; and during times when their conditions worsen - which I infer to be signs indicating the onset of complications like infection, sepsis can follow. This suggests an awareness among medieval practitioners (doctors) about secondary issues such as potential spreading pus or blood flow beyond simple fractures – a concern for serious consequences if not properly managed with restraint and immediate medical response. The translation delves into the treatment process, highlights critical observations made by healers indicating what was considered healthy recovery versus worsening conditions leading to potentially life-threatening complications at that time in history.
If those and feel in them contractions and piercing, you will know that the bone of the body is saved and the humors guard their cure.

When your constriction at the site of the fracture is loose/loose-fitting, it means that something has been adjusted or loosened properly in place where there was a break (implying he And when you have lengthened the area of the fracture, it implies that some form of extension or stretching has been applied to alleviate a minor constriction associated with
And if you find the situation of your bones and constriction as we have described when restoring the limb to its position, then that's what you should do (implying a continuation or an action based on previously discussed treatment methods for healing). This line suggests following specific procedures outlined in medical texts from this time period. It implies adherence to established wisdom regarding bone fractures and related constrictions within the context of medieval medicine practices.
If you fear atrophic contracture (which refers to the wasting away and tightening of skin after a fracture), then apply pressure on the constriction, keeping both bones within reach by day seven as we've discussed today—emphasizing timely intervention. This line underscores an immediate response when specific conditions are met (fearing contract
Then consider the bandage in all parts for three days to ensure that it does not become conspicuous or inflamed at the site of application, and avoid excess food intake on limbs due to unnecessary tightness caused by constriction—thereby correcting everything as we have outlined. This line advises on dietary considerations following a fracture (to prevent issues related with too much consumption that could exacerbate swelling or discomfort) and reinforces the importance of proper care including rest, nutrition, immobilization in treatment duration, as well as adhering to previously mentioned methods for ensuring optimal healing.
If today you are on bed rest and there is no cause for the swelling, do not remove the bandage but rather leave it in place for up to three days or more.

Translation of your provided text appears incomplete, but I will attempt to understand and translate the context related to a bone
The provided text seems to be a description in Old French or archaic Latin related to the anatomy of the arm (brachis), which includes two bones connected by joints: one small and referred to as the "finger," while the other is larger, located proximally from where the finger articulates. Here's a translation into English line by line for clarity:
When either the large or small fire is broken only once, and their pieces are used together as one instrument.
When the small flame below is broken, then restoration and healing of it are made easier for him/her.
When the patient's fire (body energy) is broken for a long time after an injury of the body part becomes ill and healing it gets difficult.
When that hump of it (the cold humor) is when two bones are broken,
Therefore, if the bone that has been broken is the small one above (possibly referring to a part of the pelvis or hip), it is convenient for the doctor; you must restore this bone so briefly until such time as when that piece becomes stable within its place.
May it be that if the great fire is what we have ignited, then I will hold back its violent extension firmly.
If the two fever spots are connected and you pause their extraction forcefully, then do so with caution/carefulness.
When the figure of the hand must be rested and extended over a pillow, placing its palms at the body' extricable parts (the head), put all others as directed by them, positioning their ears on top of other things, with malady underneath an inverted cushion.
When a hernia is present under or above him therein now, in order that the humors may not worsen.
Extend the arm of the participating person quickly with their hand or bandage on it, and another minister extends downwards like a drape.
And let the doctor gently insert the bone into that which has been swolthy, following its best shape as possible.
If in the bone fracture there is swelling throughout the entire body part where it occurs due to your action (implying injury or treatment), then address and reduce all pain at that location with what you have as a remedy, according to your ability/knowledge.
If there appears in you separate satiety that pushes the navel and is not within your hope for its restoration, then upon it act according to our previous indication.
May it be that if there is a bone breakage (fracture), you have felt pain in one place only (singular), and therefore take the care of that particular spot.
If you prick the patient's wound with cauterizing needles after their restoration, then tie a linen soaked in olive oil and white wax around that spot where the abscess is; also place pause emplastrum prepared from powdered honey mixed with clay for healing. Afterward, replace the wax and apply pressure bandages again until it subsides; thereafter secure a stone placed over this fracture point which was set in place by you using force.
You understand that the name of the bones in the arm is found mainly in two major positions, either a fracture at one focus or at two foci simultaneously.
Here comes the text to translate: Return your pressure on the location of the fracture very firmly and vigorously, and when you may even release the tightness from the parts above or below the fractured bone, return it with just a little moistened pressure following its recall in the main discussion.
Here are the translations line by line:
Consider the limb (body part) with its natural elasticity today. If there is any cause that requires correction, address it immediately to the affected limb and ensure that you bandage or wrap the limb with water-soaked cloth until the inflammation subsides.
And let it rest inside where it was compressed, and return its tightness.
If the dislocation has been softened and the bone appears to be returning back towards its original position, then straighten out all of it with your willpower.
Consider if the nourishment is prohibited to prevent harm to the body part due to excessive tightness; when this occurs, it's necessary that you soften that little bit and strengthen over time until they can have what they need again.
If in the patient' extramundan cause is not alleviated within two days or sent away from these causes, then do not attempt to separate it further into parts for more than that timeframe.
When it is necessary for his abdomen' extraneous fluid (suspendua) to be lifted due to its active motion causing him discomfort and sleep on the chest floor should occur:
You understand that this fracture is restored in either xxx days or xxxii days, and all depends on the complexity of the injury and the disposition of the body.

The phrase "Restauracio de fractura de la pinche de la ma e dels ditz" in a medical context related to English, seems like it's discussing the treatment of a
The provided sentence appears to be from Medieval Latin with some linguistic elements possibly influenced by local Romance languages like Italian or Spanish: "Sapias que a la pinche de la ma endeve fractura, e non accideys a lor sino atricio motas veguadas." Here's the translation into English considering historical context and medical terminology of that era:
When you have the patient' extruding or herniating their bowels, then take hold that the humors follow out and lie in such measure as is of equal parts by ten, and place your hand over it thereupon which covers its extension.
Extend the minister'se fingers into those broken together where they have joined well (good congruency).
When you have stopped the bleeding with plaster and lint (bandage), and placed pressure stone under according to the quantity of blood present in that place, then you already have wrapped it all up in a linen cloth.
If the bruise is in the parts of your belly, and it appears like drape fabric, then order the patient to press that area with their hand firmly held together (as if holding onto a long cloth); this will strengthen the pressure applied by the hands on the bruised part.
And if it is necessary for the body's core to rest on the cloth wherein it rises, then tightly hold that second one with your strength.
If the fracture is in the parts beyond repair, then stop below these two stones from the parted joint and hold them with your hand so that it becomes protected (healed) and stiff; also pause the swelling, as when you rotate the movement of the hand back between the fingers.
If you break the bones of your fingers, and it is in your thumb, then gently hold them as close to the palm as possible, if you wish, pause for a little while on this small stone under their finger (palma), so that the fracture can be raised and not deformed.
May it be so that if the fracture is in those other places (the hip joint or groin area), similar to where there was one initially, then hold and place your hand on what they call this; otherwise, continue placing them all according to continuation, which would be better. Alternatively, pause over a small stone as when we placed it between the feet.
Consider when restoring, and position that which is applied for apostemy caution – as in the treatment process – according to what has been narrated about you (the patient).

In restoring a pubic bone fracture, one might interpret the line as referring to treatment procedures for a broken pelvic bone (coxa), such as:
The bone of the pubic region (coxa) has been broken and is considered displaced from its normal position, as per what it feels to be separate now rather than together with adjacent structures within the body or pelvic socket (os piriforme). The Latin phrasing indicates that medical professionals have assessed a fracture where there seems to have occurred an alteration in alignment.
The restoration of him is done so that the sinew is tightened over the fracture and another bandage afterward; the humidity settles on his abdomen and face.
Whenever it is necessary for the minister (physician) to extend their reach according to the quality of the break in bone location during feverish heat moments:
Might it be for the knee joint'dictorium (assumed term here), then apply one lashing to the tendon at the thigh segment of the femur bone, so that extension occurs in them, and another as soon after a fracture.
If the dislocation is promoted by dryness, then it will be treated with linen bandage and its extension to the joints immediately.
Here the doctor gently wraps the arm around their own twice as much until it reduces that second back into its natural form and good union of bones; provided they do not paralyze a member affected by apoplasia (tissue decay due to poor circulation). If there is an ulcer present, then you should keep it clean for as many days until the sore heals, and return to your usual care afterwards.
The contracture of him is painful: the hard bandage that covers the fracture, and folds it twice or thrice a while, removes excess; and properly wraps around within so as to reach up to the ankle and knee joints of his thigh.
Here the leather strap is inserted between the thigh and calf of that particular body region where pain occurs after using too much bandage, then their extremities (hands/feet) attached to this belt by means above those joints which are on top for balance purposes.
Return your pause above that bone at the location of that breakage, and a stone placed upon the bones of her thighs.
Return the empty spaces between the blanket and thighs with molasses, to ensure that bleeding is stopped.
Here begins the constriction of a tight band around the site of the three-layered or four-layered breakage; and as you move away from the location of the fracture, your tightness decreases, and softer pressure is applied along with moisture.

This line is likely attempting to describe a bone injury involving the hip (femur), forearm/elbow (ulna, which could be what "pent" refers to in this context if we consider it as an abbreviation or misspelling of 'ulna'),
When the hip bone (femur) is broken, it lies in its current position and leans slightly towards the upper body's joint involved ('partita'), with hands placed behind to provide support or stabilization. This translation assumes "conh" refers to 'córa,' which means thigh/hip area of bone injury contextually here; however, due to possible language mixing in this excerpt (Medieval Latin-like phrasing combined with some modern Spanish terminology), there may be interpretative variations:

When a bone fracture is healed, according to Roman tradition: not for arbitrary reasons but due to causes such as overuse of the ligament and tendon which has been injured; or because excessive tightness within these structures prevents nourishment from reaching the limb. These could be caused by continuous motion outside its natural timing (overextension), superfluous padding around a joint that impedes circulation, sudden movements causing undue strain on muscles and tendons, accumulation of fluid in tissues leading to swelling ("pauquesa"), or excessive pressure inside the abdomen affecting lymphatic drainage.
Care for the excess water is to drain it away from the body and make the patient's heart tender within, apply washing, and administer gauze and tendernthy balm on them.
Return the pause (pressure) on the limb so that it draws nourishment into itself or remains embedded in water vapor within its body cavity, ensuring that nourishment circulates back to restore the body'dict normal form.
The provided text appears to be translating medical practices or conditions from an ancient language
When the bones are set in a twisted manner, it is forbidden to operate on them now (implying that immediate surgical intervention should not be pursued). This sentence emphasizes caution and suggests rest instead of or as an alternative before considering any kind of operation. It's likely addressing proper treatment for certain types of bone
When the limb has been properly set for tortuosity and elevation of the broken bone, it is guarded by way of binding; however, this member cannot be precluded from natural healing surgery at present time (implying immediate intervention should not occur). The text implies that while a bound or immobilized limb isn't eligible for an operation under these circumstances—due to the focus on nature’dictated healing of recent fractures—it does suggest future possibilities if natural recovery fails. It stresses careful monitoring and management, with surgery as a last resort should conservative methods not lead to expected improvements in bone alignment or reduction over time.
If doctors and restorers have caused this in our treatment, such surgery would be lost without merit due to great fear of the quality with which we are associated; they imply that if their interventions led poorly or negatively affected patient outcomes (perhaps implying a previous unsatisfactory situation), it could harm one’s reputation. This sentence indicates concern over professional consequences and stresses not only physical but also reputational risks in medical practices, underscoring the importance of excellence both clinically and interpersonally within their field for do
If stiffness and binding are recent developments (meaning not long ago), then it is said that they should be bathed in a bath containing soothing herbs, similar to aloe and rice bran; or perhaps their poultice consists of the mucilage from these same grains along with linseed oil or sesame seed oil for application on such limps (swollen joints); alternatively, they may be treated with a mixture that includes flax galls which are known in certain apothecary arts as agents to consolidate and heal wounds. This passage outlines various home remedies or medical interventions for stiffness possibly related to inflammation—emphasizing the use of natural substances like aloe, rice bran, flax galls (which might form during a process involving linseed), as well as oils derived from plants. The procedures involve external applications such as bathing or poultices and suggest that these are traditional remedies for consolidating wounds with their medicinal properties in mind—emphasizing the importance of natural, plant-based treatments within medieval medicine's scope (context provided by language structure which often hints at classical texts).
Some substances are dissolved by continuous exposure to cold fire that is applied on the body in all parts and at all times.
May it if tenderness has been increasing recently and turned into stone and caused the need for care with iron tools as its pus descends from above cessations below bone dissolution, excess fluid production by that metallurgist down to where joints become loose fitting together due to continuous use; this is administered easily in response to urgent requests.
Capitol .xxiii. (Note: "Capitulum" could
The phrase "de sermo in dislocatio" translates to English as "from speech into
The translation of the provided medieval medical text into modern English is as follows: "From speech dislocation whereby no movement occurs; hence it necessitates an intervention for the limb and brings upon severe foot pain and large bruises." This line describes a situation in which someone has suffered from a joint being forced out of its normal position, resulting in restricted mobility (no movement), consequent injuries to their feet including significant discomfort ("foot pain") and potentially extensive swelling or hematoma characterized by "large bruises". The mention of speech may relate
When fever accompanies joint dislocation, it is necessary to promptly perform reduction; if delayed, the location becomes fixed and water (blood or other fluids) accumulates therein making subsequent attempts at reducing a locked joint more challenging. This line emphasizes that when an acute infection like fever occurs alongside a dislocated limb ("ad alcu"), immediate action is required to reposition, known as "perforsar que sia reduzit." Failure or delay leads to the affected area becoming immobile (fixed) and resulting fluid accumulation makes further reduction efforts difficult. Here 'accideys' may refer metaphorically not just to physical illness but potentially also psychological distress
Therefore it is not necessary to bind or tie down the limb while attempting reduction; however, if movements are too frequent during this process ("motas vegetadas"), cramps and sharp pains will ensue. This statement suggests that constraining a dislocated joint with bandages (binding) isn't required when doing so for immobilization purposes at the time of attempted repositioning ('apostemacio'). However, if movements happen during this
When you acquire acidity, cover yourself with the flapper of humors in the malady (body), and place your body inside so that restoration begins; also return your member to its position in water caudle and oils, and reduce it for ease.

And when the displacement occurs as described in a fracture, it enters from one side of the body into the other.
Given that "Capitol" is not accompanied by additional text in this context,
When it comes to the treatment of a displaced jawbone injury:
So dislocated the jaws if not set; and for their displacement there are two methods: either they are slightly moved from their places with a little removal, and treated briefly at that location—here saliva comes out of its place (mouth) due to blockage in it. Alternatively, complete separation accompanied by conjunctivitis occurs here where the patient'se tongue is wrapped within his/her speech; treatment prevents them from holding or closing their mouth because they cannot retain what goes into and outside of their mouths any longer.
May when the displacement of it is slight, in the major positions returns by itself a little bit.
May if the dislocation is entire and complete, then it should be promptly addressed with its reduction, without delay in total.
The minister holds the chin of the patient, and inserts the doctor's finger from one jaw joint into the area of dislocation in the lower part of the mouth (if it is just one side), or both fingers simultaneously if it involves two sides, holding their hands. The doctor commands the jaw to stop moving and release any parts that have detached; then gently manipulthy relocates the jaw back into its original position.
If it is difficult to reduce him/her (the patient), and mostly if both jaws are dislocated, administer a poultice of water and oil inside the tailbone entrance, so that even with difficulty he/she will eventually be able to return reduction for both, thus completing what we have discussed.
And when they return and their mouth is closed and not soothed yet, place talcum powder on those pills of cloth therein, the wax and oil rubbed upon them for ease in speaking with breaths.
E when the patient lies on their back and their head rests between two pillows, so that it does not move to either of its parts nor for some other reason; do not force-feed them bread (their food), but wait until the pains are alleviated and the jaws stop drooling, then give water.
And if it is to be administered easily, and not work on the opening of the mouth for food intake and drinking until the jawbone becomes numb and heals.
If the reduction of two dislocated jaws is difficult at any time and cannot be converted back to their respective positions during events, then constant fevers occur, and you must urgently press on the abdomen under pressure, and likewise forcefully apply cholera pure.
When you take it again, then realize that I have lost it; and proceed carefully to the place where this fluid has accumulated over those days.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part
During the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone (furcula) and the limb's tendon/muscle, it is necessary to carefully manipulate these structures back into their normal position without causing further injury or pain.
The collarbone is not typically dislocated due to its attachment at the chest (pectus), but it can become so if an action causes displacement; and when this occurs, it's noted in terms of sensation or feeling within that region. This suggests a link between physical trauma resulting from movement outside normal ranges (veguadas) leading to dislocation – emphasizing the importance for medical professionals to be aware of symptoms indicating such injuries as they can provide vital clues about patient experiences and potential damage
The restoration process involves applying pressure to the affected area, so that it can stabilize under its own weight (mula) and extend outwards using supporting structures such as straps or bandages – implying a manual technique used by healers where external support is applied directly onto an injury site for immobil Apply pressure to the location with your hand as you attempt containment or reduction – indicating that manual compression by practitioners may assist in repositioning dislocated joints towards their natural alignment for potential return (retorna). This line suggests a hands
Pause pressure over the bandage and cushion, then strengthen that – suggesting intermittent application of force combined with supportive devices to maintain or correct an injury's position during its healing process; a technique likely used by medieval
The extremity that holds the hernia remains in place every day and is not displaced on any given day – but when it's reduced (put back into position) as instructed by those who are knowledgeable about this, or according to your apparatus; implying a reliance on expertise for treatment adjustments based upon the state of healing. This emphasizes that professional guidance and possibly physical devices were considered in managing hernias during medieval times – ensuring proper care was tailored as needed by observing patient'severyday condition, with particular attention to how well-maintained a reduction is according to expert direction
Here comes the sentence to translate: Return your hand pressure over that plastering, and light pulsation/massage, extractive technique; command the humors (fluids) within it to settle down and return into rest until healed.
And in this treatment method, pain from the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
The provided text appears to be translating medical practices from Middle Aged Latin or
From the reduction of muscle dislocation." This line suggests a treatment procedure in medieval medicine for correcting what they describe as an 'muscle dislocation
Know that the muscle is not dislocated but in three ways: one where it becomes dislocated from its origin at once (immedioption), and another way." Here, two methods of what they believe to be 'dislocation' are described—one immediate ('immediate option') and potentially others ("another," which could refer to additional techniques that follow). This indicates an understanding in medieval medical practice that muscle dislocations might occur rapidly or through a series of events leading up
The second is that it becomes dislocated below the muscle fiber, and this happens (translated as 'it takes place'); it's not dislocated in the parts behind concerning shoulder; nor on the ends of nerves." This passage clarifies a specific method by which they believe a muscle can become misaligned ('dislocated'), with reference to its position relative to other anatomical structures, like those around the shoulders and within peripheral nervous systems. The notion here reflects medieval attempts at understanding human physiology in context of injury or dysfunction as it relates to dislocations
Mostly it is a displacement and escape of the tendon from its joints (ligaments), mostly in those where veins are thin; maybe also when muscle fibers themselves move out." Here, they describe what seems to be 'dislocation' as an issue that often involves movement or slippage ('escape') of connective tissues like ligaments and tendons from their joints. It further suggests the possibility of dislocations where veins are thin ("thin-veined") areas—a reflection on how they might perceived connections between different parts, as well as potential challenges when muscles themselves move out or become displaced ('motas'). This line reveals medieval medical thought concerning anatomical relationships and pathologies that arise from them.
And when the acid touches or casts upon his bones through palpation or fracturing, and he has a paralyzed muscle due to loosening of joint connections, it is being compressed by fluid that already caused displacement (dislocation).
Now cover that which you breatthy exhale while standing overboard of it; and proceed with its healing process hereafter.

If you wish to perform this action: and there should be present a long rod from the patient'se groin area belonging herewith (which is referred as 'laz in the source text), positioned under it, immediately insert your muscle into the hernia quickly while lifting what comes out of the abdomen with another servant; this will suspend the hernium within air. May it be that the thigh is weakened and another cause causes its suspension, thus making it return with such force as soon as possible when loosely repositioned/realigned.

The pressure above the staff is maintained on the belly, and its extension along the length of the staff aligns with intervals from another part belonging to it for strengthening purposes. This extends also the limbs back towards their original joint location rapidly.
If it is difficult to reduce the hernia for all these reasons mentioned, then use this treatment: take a stick of which its length equals two arm lengths, and the girth four finger widths wide at the palm's base (the thumb), where you hold.
And place cloths or linens on his head, so that it does not press down the abdomen (the patient's stomach).

You understand that the shoulder joint is dislocated; and it's displaced in all parts, mostly towards the posterior part of its articulation, and your own manipulations or touches according to any form are not dangerous if done carefully when realigning a previously dislocated shoulder. For once repositioned correctly, that juncture becomes concaved; hence it cannot bend the arm nor reach for what'dict.
When the hips are cracked and you reduce the displacement so much that a cautious application of force is needed (and if it's necessary to apply such force), difficult or nearly impossible will be its reduction, unless at the joint areas where all other species from dislocation exist in totality, causing greater pain than usual along with continuous movements towards them; hence they are more likely leading to death.
When the restoration of it is possible, which means that their body should be stretched out and extended in position (arms upward), and hands placed on hips or under chest area to return its joints into place at hip points or between fingers/palm touching each other where metge's hands are.
If the dislocation is in the parts nearby (implying it's close to or affecting a joint), then return them so that your hand rests on its surface until you hear the click of the knee wherein their palm touches, indicating proper alignment has been restored.
If the dislocation does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and strong motion.
And when two ministers stretch their arms and hold that instrument between them, it is to prevent excessive extension from happening.
And they turn over their arms entirely, placing a long cloth or bandage wrapped around the body of them, held by lariat.

Regarding the care for a joint displacement where it is between the arm and the body (possibly referring to an elbow or shoulder), here's the translation:
When some of the masses are displaced and reducing its dislocation is difficult, it may occur at other joints as well; however, if reduction happens quickly when it's displaced, so that a fracture becomes immobilized (apostem or closed fracture), then:
The reduction of the dislocation is that you stop the joint between the thigh bone and its socket on a table, and have the attendant extend that part, with either your hand or palm over the impending joint intersection; then push it back to where it belongs.
Whenever it is considered that the palm has been left on the belly of the patient, then the hernia must be pressed down with two hands upon a table to extend and reduce; if dislocation precedes, then place the position of the body over that intrinsic so that the doctor' extrication can occur at that impending joint.
So if it returns shortly afterward, all is well then; but if not, that painful spot will harden and worsen until you intervene with today'thy treatment which has passed these days.
May the joint according to its twisted nature; and there is nothing in the malady that affects it, but rather it becomes soothed, with no cause being able to strengthen it; understand then that the nerves are compressed or squeezed, and you will realize when stretching for treatment purposes and strong water confer a cause.
So when they are returned (probably referring to some form of therapy or treatment), place the one that has been prepared upon them, and have it laid down with strength for days; furthermore, cut off its excess and exercise both sides thereof daily.
May it happen that the patient' extraneous movement is ceased and some cold water poured into its tail (anus), along with a few warm baths, until they are relieved.
Given that "Capitol" is not actually part of the medical text
The provided phrase in Latin, which translates to "On the treatment of dislocations," sets the context for a discussion on methods used
When discussing joints (the Italian term 'dita' refers generically to body parts, but in this case it suggests fingers or potentially other appendages), some occasions lead them out of place
When a finger (or similar appendage) is dislocated at the base of one's palm or abdomen ("la ventre"), you should hold it and gently move the joint back into place until return to normal positioning occurs, which implies realignment through physical manipulation. This line suggests an early medieval approach where direct hands-on techniques were commonly used for such injuries without modern medical equipment; however, care must be taken as incorrect handling could worsen the injury or cause additional pain and harm.
Support (or hold) the head of the finger that was dislocated and suspend it at which segment caused displacement; leave this for two days ("layssa"). This statement implies rest or immobilization as a key aspect in treating joint injuries, aligning with medieval medical philosophy where minimal movement post-injury often led to recovery. However, the lack of
Furthermore suspend and extend that segment where it was dislocated until straightened on that very day; this indicates an intervention to align the affected part of the body back into its natural position, suggesting a hands-on treatment technique reminiscent of practices from medieval medicine
If the finger is not straightened quickly as recounted (or described), hold that segment and gradually return it to its former position during daytime, but leave for night rest without strain—this implies a cautious approach respecting both healing time ("alcus dias") and preventive measures against further injury. Here the medieval medical practice leans towards patience combined with limited mobilization under careful supervision; it emphasizes gradual recovery while avoiding overexertion that could lead to additional damage—a concept consistent with humoral theory, where balance in bodily fluids (humors) was believed key for
When it seems like water (i.dict "aquo"), if the patient's belly is dislocated ("dislocat al ventre de la ma"), bring that to this part and make an initial operation for cleansing/healing, until they are healed.

The phrase in question appears to be related to the treatment of vertebral displacement, which can typically involve a medical term from an archaic or specialized form
When any of the vertebrae in the back or neck are dislocated and immobilized at that location, it is not treated immediately because if pressure on these displaced spinal bones continues for too long, death may occur due to interruption of blood flow (commonly referred to as 'blood supply').
E swelling of the bladder is called an outflow disease because it wants to leave and cannot be retained; thus, we soften either its members or legs at will (or two), including one for these reasons as well: when moved gently, they are removed from their place; repeatedly moving them causes removal along with healing of those parts into four sections.
So then she has become swollen behind and is without coloration (or pallor).

If you wish to take the current situation as it is; and you must stay with your head on the patient's buttocks for two sticks in length - one arm long, and another from the top of their shoulders down to the backside of their feet (where each stick measures roughly a palm), there will already be an affected part somewhere along these lengths. Each limb must rest upon its own base so that it does not become gouty.
And take a staff in which he turns himself back and forth between the two sticks of his arms.
In the limb there is a disruption in which it forms a staff of length equal to that for rotation; and in the other two staves, they appear similar to this one.
Return the ligaments that you have stretched in the hips and thighs where it needs to be held by your hand, and those same ligaments that are stretched between the patient'thy knees when twisted for which they need to hold their feet upward as well.
Each turn and position must have one appointed who tightens the joint at its place; let the doctor manipulate the spine as we've mentioned before.
Return the spine to its place and secure it with bandaging after applying pressure dressings soaked in warm oil from an herbal booklet; apply padding over the cast of the lumbar vertebra where three or more inches are inserted vertically into this area, covering as much wetness loss due to inflammation. Over the spinal fracture site is placed with these layers: pressure dressings soaked in warm oil from an herbal booklet first for its healing properties; then padding over the cast of the lumbar vertebra itself—which should extend three or more inches vertically into this area to cover as much wetness loss due to inflammation.
Return its ligaments as we have mentioned, and place it under moisture for healing of the malady within.
If there is any possibility of infection at the site during healing, then medicines that moisten and cleanse have been administered for a long time as recommended; and now such medicine has already been applied to this location with lead (plumbing).

The title of that person who suffers from displacement is because the accidents (ailments or injuries) are contrary to this misfortune.
E the one to whom you dislocate is lying down with his cushion supported undernethy parts hereafter complimented, but not allowing that pain in the joints which he has now may double; if it perforates and moves beyond these points then urine becomes retained within him and fistula forms at those places. You must walk on your toes therefrom.
E the name of that person to whom dislocation occurs behind is such that it does not expand the chest cavity nor can bend what has bent therein, and this cushion under them is short as compared with another (possibly for their legs), which eases the joints, and its collarbone lies at that location.
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and if the dislocation is old and ancient, then it has already been addressed by your current management here at home according to its disposition; hence there'thy no need for further remedy in that regard.
May it be in the place where dislocation has occurred recently and is one of the four species of dislocation; therefore, turn that which was displaced back to its proper joints on both sides (thighs and feet), left side and right side alike so well-restored. Once returned, no further treatment from others will be necessary for this specific injury.
Mayhaps, if it does not return in this phase, the one who prepares must act firmly and extend from below the part previously placed under cushions at intervals; or directly on those same supports (cushions), another servant extends their mattress above that level. Another attendant stretches the said material further upwards to meet the joint pains, holding onto hands tightly with a leather bandage applied over it - and an additional minister tends to maintain this position firmly on each extremity (hand or foot).
When there is extension from the area of the head towards the shoulder joint or vice versa between the chest and back parts, it indicates movement in these areas which may be painful for the patient.
When all of these are stretched within a period until the humour is lifted above its place in the earth and begins to descend,
This specific type of extension is characteristic throughout all four (or regions/parts).
Therefore, if the displacement returns with water that we have mentioned, do so quickly; but if not, it is necessary for all special waters required by their treatment plan.
In the patient's reduction, when dislocated and displaced to their parts, cover so that the malady is rested on its chest; hold back the ligaments at the junction between the top of the thigh and where it joins with the pelvis; extend the ligament in the part belonging to the shoulder joint towards either end portion of the shoulder blade.
Here comes another servant with strong suction to the limbs of the patient, and compresses deeply into the hollow of the thigh area for vigorous extension; when this force returns to its place.
This particular substance is of yellow bile which heals this member that other substances cannot reduce.
If you are able to stand on your feet and not comply with this specific method of treatment, it is essential that two weights be placed between the thighs linked together by a strong thread or rope; both legs must also have corresponding straps (belts) attached.

When dislocation occurs in the limbs, it is necessary to stretch out that which has been displaced; and according to this method of treatment described by doctors, they pause their hand's thumb over the misplaced joint, while another person presses on that same part with a different palm. They hold pressure until the extended body segment returns to its proper place at once (likely referring to immobilizing or repositioning an injured limb back into alignment).
If dislocation occurs at the joints behind (the hips), then: do not allow the malady to spread outwards onto the parts below; having those who are bound above due to hardness that have been detached from their anchors and placed on top, they should be positioned over its face. There is no place for restraint here as stated before (in this treatise).
When a compression is applied using a table at the location where joint pain occurs,
So when the reduction is complete, as indicated by "cover," and it's not my concern to fix this (the term for 'reduction'), you extend limbs supported on hammock-like cushions; once these are adjusted so that they expand outwards like wings, making sure that none of those wide belts is stretched too tightly across any body part. Then make the folds and expansions in place for three to four days while keeping pressure applied with bandages or similar aids.
Return the ligament and bandage (ligamentum et empastrum), and compare one cushion with another (unam comparatis cum alia).

When it comes to the treatment of a herniated disc, here's how one might translate and interpret such medieval Latin terminology into
The hernia is displaced according to three methods: it can be out of place in the parts beyond (possibly referring to extremities), and within its own divisions, between segments or joints – but not at this time where we are observing it now; essentially indicating that when a disc dislocation occurs away from certain points around an injured area like shoulders or hips, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "The sign of dislocation is that you command the hump to apply its cushion at the thigh, and if it does so, understand that this means a dislocation.
The restoration of all the limbs is that you straighten out the malady rightly; so much so that your foot can be stretched over it if possible, and attach the thighs to the face of the patient, pausing the leg between the feet; moreover, apply leather attached with one'se hands (the servant), placing another on their legs and chest holding hands.
When it is said that a man' extricates himself from labor, his cushion stays in the area between the thighs at rest without effort.
Return that and fix it on the couch leg (limb), applying those adhesives to one thigh area with bandages for three days or four, and apply those as well.
No use the limb for walking until it has healed and become comfortable.
If your reduction of the patient is waived off you must apply firm extension force on their ligaments as mentioned in the previous treatment of the hip joint.

And pushes the chest of the patient into the firm cushion, and you are at the bedside.
So if he returns to health within a cure or two from this treatment and his foot swells up again, then all is well—but if not, repeat the operation until that return occurs.
If you are not allowed to reduce it at home as recommended by the water we have here (implying some form of liquid treatment), then complain about your knee over its two on earth, and immediately start a herb poultice firmly bound between their thighs; moreover, this is covered with cloth so that you do not expose your knee.

Here the doctor elevates the displacement back to its place in their joints, and another minister'supinates the healthy hip joint into sections again when the displacement returns; this is for ease of movement.
And when the dislocation returns and it is declared to you as health restored from its reduction, then apply strong binding on that bandage and secure your foot with it attached to the sling/bandage.
When you fear or protect the nerves behind which are located on the foot, to prevent the ligament from being violent and leading that one'thy strength be not diminished.
Return it within two or three days, and if the bandage softens, extend that amount.
Return that part of it either in the morning or in the afternoon and prevent the humors from rising for forty days. May it not happen that if one goes beyond this space, the dislocation will not be safe and sound therein, nor will they receive medical care.
If you apply cold application (cold treatment), then immediately after doing so in the place where we describe it herein for healing and bandaging purposes, ensure that your patient is cooled down sufficiently at this location of care.

And if it is a case of the limb being dislocated (likely referring to an arm or leg), gently extend them as far back into position; and if this can be easily done without undue strain, return them." This translation attempts to convey instructions for managing what appears to be a simple dislocation injury. It suggests that gentle extension of the affected limb is recommended when possible (without causing pain or further damage),
And if the dislocation is in one of your arms (the forearm), then take care to lift or raise it over the shoulder joint on that arm above ground level—or even resting upon a tabletop, keeping it as you were before." This translation advises how to position an injured limb with a possible elbow dislocation. It suggests lifting and placing the affected forearm in such a way to stabilize what is possibly already causing some form of inconvenience or impairment ("ayssi cum si anava"). The aim appears to be maintaining mobility while preventing
Maintain your posture while keeping the elbow on something to stabilize it—perhaps a tabletop or similar surface near where you find yourself during recovery; and notice that it rests there without appearing out of place." This translation provides instructions for maintaining an affected arm's position, possibly after dislocation reduction. The patient is advised not only to keep the elbow stable but also observe if returning its usual posture does so without causing displacement or apparent misalignment ("engualhat e no aparesce en le loc eminência"). This suggests a focus on proper alignment and healing positioning of an arm following dislocation treatment. The use of "loc" may indicate the immediate recovery
