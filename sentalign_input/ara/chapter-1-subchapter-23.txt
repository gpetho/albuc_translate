Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If humors prevail in the trachea, especially if this is accompanied by a cold temperament, then it is necessary for the patient to first be purged with laxative medications, then cauterize him with a cautery in the pit of the throat at the base of the larynx in the depressed area.
Beware of reaching the larynx with the cautery and do not burn more than half of the skin, then cauterize him with another cautery at the joint of the neck at the end of its last vertebra, profoundly, and the cautery should be nail-shaped according to the description that preceded.
Then treat him with what was mentioned previously until he recovers, God willing.
