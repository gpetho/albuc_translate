In many men, hard abscesses appear inside the lips, resembling vetch grains, both smaller and larger; then you must turn the lips, and cut open each knot, and take it with tweezers and cut it on each side; then fill the place after the incision with ground vitriol, until the blood is stanched; and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with drying agents until it is healed.	A good many people sometimes get little hard swellings inside their lips, some resembling the vetch grain; some larger, some smaller. You should invert the lip, incise all along each nodule, catch it up with a hook, and cut it away all round. Then after incising rub pounded vitriol into the places until the bleeding stops. Then let him rinse with vinegar and salt, and dress the place with styptic drugs till the wounds heal.	0.89765376
