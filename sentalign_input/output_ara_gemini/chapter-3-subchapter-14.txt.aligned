Chapter Fourteen on the Reduction of a Femur Fracture	CHAPTER FOURTEEN. On setting a fracture of the femur.	0.70606816
The femur bone often breaks and is perceptible to the senses because it turns forward and backward.	The femur is often broken, and this is readily discernible, for it will rotate forwards or backwards.	0.83400124
Its mending is done by tightening a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, while the patient is lying on his face.	It is set by binding a bandage above the fracture and another below, while the patient lies flat on his face.	0.91538477
Then an assistant stretches each bandage to its side moderately, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.	Then each assistant should make an even extension in his own direction, by the bandage. This is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.	0.7684397
But if it is close to the origin of the femur, it is necessary to tighten a soft bandage, either from wool or similar, at the origin of the femur towards the pubis, so that the stretching is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.	But if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, you should tie on a soft bandage of wool or something similar, at the root of the thigh toward the groin, so that extension may be applied above, and another bandage below the fracture.	0.8864324
Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee so that the stretching is downwards.	Likewise if the fracture is near the knee the bandage should be near the knee, so that extension may be made downwards.	0.92974615
Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until he restores it to its natural form, and the bone unites well.	Then the doctor should straighten it out with both hands until he has reduced it to the pattern of the natural form and the bone unites neatly.	0.8931755
Then it is necessary to apply the bandage and tightening if no hot swelling occurs to the limb. If swelling occurs in it, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to its treatment.	Then you will have to apply the plaster and bandage if there is no effusion in the limb, but if there is an effusion leave it for a few days until the swelling has gone down, then resume your treatment.	0.8423128
As for its tightening, it is necessary to twist a solid, wide turban over the fracture two or three times, and whatever is left over remains.	As to the bandaging, you should wrap a firm broad sash two or three times round the fracture, leaving some over; then bind the leg up so that the heel is brought to reach the root of the buttock.	0.70531344
Then twist the leg until the heel is at the origin of the buttock, and insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread become from above on both sides. Then wrap what is left of the turban around the leg and thigh.	Then pass a long cord in the space between the thigh and the leg, low down near the knee, and let the ends of the cord come up on either side, then bind the rest of the sash over the leg and the thigh.	0.90382195
Then place the splints on the thigh at the fracture site itself, and place one of them on the leg bone.	Then apply splints to the thigh at the very site of the fracture and put one of the splints on the leg-bone.	0.93341947
Then fill the gap between the thigh and the leg with soft cloths to level the tightening.	Then pack soft material in the space between the leg and the thigh to make the bandaging even.	0.8437664
Then start with strong tightening from the middle over the fracture site, three or four turns, and the further you move the bandage from the fracture site, let your tightening be less, softer, and looser.	Then start with three or four turns of a strong bandage in the middle over the site of the fracture, and as you get away from the site of the fracture bind lighter and softer and looser.	0.91802543
Then go to the ends of the thread that you had inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie with it the adjacent splints from above, then pass the ends of the thread down until you reach the man's ankle, and tighten with them also the ends of the splints from the other side so that the bandage does not move from its place.	Then turn to the two ends of the cord which you previously passed between the thigh and the leg, and with the cord bind the adjacent splints above, then carry the ends downward until you end up at the great tendon of the foot and with them bind also the extremities of the splints at the other end so that the bandaging will not shift from its place.	0.8671657
Then leave the tightening on it as long as no erosion, swelling, inflammation, or the like occurs to the limb. If any of this happens, immediately loosen it and fix what has happened according to what we have mentioned repeatedly.	Then let the bandaging remain on as long as no pruritus or abscess or effusion or anything of that sort happens to the limb; but if any of these occur loosen it quickly and put right whatever has taken place, in the manner we have often mentioned.	0.8726283
If there is a splinter in the bone that pricks, it is necessary to straighten it if you can, otherwise cut on it and remove it, and treat the wound as mentioned earlier until it heals.	If there be a penetrating fragment of the bone, you must reposition it if you can; but if not then cut down upon it and remove it and treat the wound in the sort of way mentioned previously, until it heals.	0.89039886
This fracture of the femur may be tightened without adding the leg to the splints, as we mentioned in the humerus and forearm.	This fracture of the thigh is sometimes bandaged without bringing the leg alongside with splints, in the way we spoke of for the humerus and the forearm.	0.8457611
Except that its mending in this way does not cause lameness to the patient, and if it is mended alone without adding the leg to it, its owner will inevitably limp forever.	But setting after the former manner does not cause the patient any lameness; whereas if the femur is set alone without binding the leg to it the patient will inevitably be lame for always.	0.78858393
And know that the femur heals in fifty days, or a little more or a little less, all according to the difference in temperaments and other conditions.	You must know that the femur knits in fifty days or a little more or less, according to the different constitutions and other circumstances.	0.8267455
