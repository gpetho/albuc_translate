Chapter seven on the treatment of rib fractures.	CHAPTER SEVEN. On the repair of a fracture of the breast.	0.7470782
The chest may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens. As for its edges, they are most often fractured and fragmented.	The breast is sometimes fractured in the middle but this happens rarely; more often it is the extremities of it that are broken and comminuted.	0.8750434
And among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and he experiences severe pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, and perhaps he spits up blood, and the concavity in the broken bone becomes apparent and is not hidden to the senses.	The symptoms that occur when it is broken in the middle are that he bows downwards and suffers violent pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and sometimes he vomits blood; and there is an obvious and palpable concavity in the bone.	0.8568118
Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, and a pillow is placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are pressed, and the ribs are gathered with the hands from both sides, and gentleness is exercised in straightening it in every way possible and suitable until the shape of the bone returns as it should be.	Now the way to mend it is for the patient to lie on his back, and you place a pillow between his shoulders; then his shoulders are squeezed, and with your hands you press together his ribs from both sides and skilfully try to equalize them in any way you conveniently can, until the bone is reduced to its proper form.	0.85861146
Then apply the dressing and the binding, and place over it a splint from a thin board of willow or heather, or something similar in lightness, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then be gentle in tying it over the broken bone so that it does not move. And pass the bandage around circularly to the back several times, and tighten it firmly. Then check the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.	Then apply over it a plaster and a pad and place over that a splint of thin willow board or brier or similar light wood, first wrapping it in cloth; then gently bind this upon the fractured bone so that it does not slip; and carry your bandage round about the back several times, tying it firmly; then inspect it constantly, and whenever it loosens tighten it.	0.918507
And if the need arises to loosen it, due to itching that occurs in the area, or pain, or swelling, then hasten to loosen it, remove the dressing, and treat whatever has occurred in its proper manner, then replace the dressing if you see a reason for it, and keep it tight until it heals.	If you are compelled to loosen it on account of itching at the place, or pain or swelling, loosen it quickly and remove the plaster and correct whatever has occurred with the appropriate treatment. Then renew the plaster if you think fit, and keep it bandaged until it heals.	0.8753675
