On the cleansing of infants and the treatment of any mishap occurring to them.
Chapter 57.
Circumcision is not a breaking of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is done by our action, by our will, and its use is specifically for children, it is necessary for us to designate the best procedure in it, and the easiest way that leads to health.
I say, therefore, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they do not practice it in their laws, and it is only something we have acquired through experience.
This is because I found that most craftsmen and phlebotomists use cleansing, circumcising with a razor and scissors; and they use compression, and binding with thread, and incision with a claw.
And indeed, I have tried all these methods, and I found no better cleansing than with scissors and binding with thread.
For with cleansing done by razor, the skin often escapes.
Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers, the upper skin may therefore be cut while the lower layer remains; thus, a further incision to cut the other layer is required, causing future pain.
And with the cleansing done by compression, that is, the digital clamp used by suturers, the incision of the tip of the male member is not assured, because it may possibly enter its opening.
However, in cleansing with a claw, the instrument may slip and spoil your procedure: and indeed, the skin of a boy is naturally short, and many are born such that they do not need cleansing, as I have already observed.
But the cleansing with scissors and thread binding has shown me good results: for the scissors are proportionate in their incision; therefore, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Thus, when you press your hand, the two sharp edges are aligned and cut as a single action in one moment; and a similar shape of compression occurs, holding the skin of the penis from all sides, with which no error occurs at all.
And the proper procedure is to make the boy believe, especially if he is one who understands a little, that you are only tying thread around his penis; and you leave it until the next day.
Then make him happy and delighted in every way possible, given what his understanding can receive.
Then have him stand with his height adjusted between your hands, and not be sitting; and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Then place your hand on his penis, blow on the skin, and pull it upward until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it of any dirt that has gathered on it.
Then tie the marked spot with double thread.
Afterward, tie a second ligature slightly below it.
Then hold the place of the lower ligature firmly with your index finger and thumb, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then lift the skin upward quickly and expose the head of the penis.
Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better), and apply powder on top; and over the powder, place a cloth spread with egg yolk cooked in rose water, shaken with fresh good rose oil: and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with the remaining remedies until it heals.
Now, the form of the scissors for cleansing is as follows.
The two ends should be blunt and cutting; let there be no branching pin between them, and the length of the two blades should be the same as the length of the two handles.
The error that occurs in cleansing is this: that perhaps the inner skin may entirely escape, or part of it at the incision.
Therefore, it is necessary to stretch it immediately with your nail before the formation of an abscess in the area, and cut it evenly.
If you cannot hold it with your nail, then draw it out with a hook and cut it.
But if three days have passed, and what is beneath the penis remains swollen, forming an abscess: then leave it until the warm abscess settles, and scrape it gently, and cut it according to what you have prepared for yourself; and take care around the head of the penis.
For that will not harm him.
Therefore, treat it with something that heals the wound using powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders; and if the cut goes beyond the skin or extends upward, that also will not harm him.
Therefore, treat it with what we have said, until it heals.
