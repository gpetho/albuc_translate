Treatment of 'axcirnah' on the upper eyelid.
Axcirnah is a growth that forms on the membranes of the upper eyelid, mostly in children, causing heaviness in their eyes and resulting in morning discharge; they cannot tolerate bright sunlight as tears flow from their eyes.
You will see them lying on their faces all the time, sleeping on their faces; the lower eyelids and eyebrows are wet and swollen, and you can feel the swelling when you press the area with your fingers.
One method is to have the patient rest their head on your lap, place a cloth on it, make a circular incision around the swelling, and press it with your fingers to gather the swelling in the center. Then, make a small lateral incision into the center of the swelling, no larger than a phlebotomy incision.
But in more severe cases, you must cut through the entire layer to reach the swelling, as in more advanced stages the swelling appears as a white substance.
Then extract it with cloths wrapped around your fingers, rotating your hands until it is removed.
Be careful not to press too much into the incision to avoid damaging the eye.
If the swelling does not appear initially, gently press the incision until the swelling emerges, then extract it as described. Soak cloths in water and vinegar, place them on the area, and press with powders.
Some people crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision to dry out the remaining moisture.
Then treat it until it heals.
If an abscess forms, treat it with cedar plaster until it heals.
