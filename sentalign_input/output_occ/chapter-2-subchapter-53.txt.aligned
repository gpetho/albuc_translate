On the treatment of cancer.	On the treatment of cancer.	1.0
We have already said, in the division, about the types of cancer and the manner of treating it with medicines, and that treatment with iron should be avoided so it does not become ulcerated; and we have discussed cancer engendered in the flesh and the precautions for its treatment.	We have spoken, in the relevant section, of the kinds of cancer and of the way in which medical treatment of them is to be attempted; with a warning against treatment by the knife lest they ulcerate. We also mentioned the cancer arising in the uterus and gave a warning against its treatment.	0.86046076
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, as with cancer in the breasts or the thigh and their similar members, to extract all of it, especially when it is just starting small.	The Ancients said that when a cancer is in a site where total eradication is possible, such as a cancer of the breast or of the thigh, and in similar parts where complete removal is possible, and especially when in the early stage and small, (then surgery was to be tried).	0.79581696
But when it is old and large, do not attempt to treat it, for I could not cure any of it nor have I seen another who could.	But when it is of long standing and large you should leave it alone. For I myself have never been able to cure any such, nor have I seen anyone else succeed before me.	0.76192564
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you precede and let the patient purge the black bile sometimes, and then bleed him, if a manifest repletion is found.	The procedure in a case amenable to treatment, as we have said, is first for the patient to be purged several times from black bile; then bleed him if his veins seem full.	0.76364565
Then prepare the patient with preparation in which he is located for the operation, and then apply hooks where necessary; and then hollow out all around with a good cutting, ensuring no root cause remains. And let the blood flow, and do not cut it lightly, and press the places, and wipe away the thick blood with your hand or with an instrument as possible.	Then put the patient in the most convenient position for operating. Then attach to the tumour hooks suited to it; then make a circular incision all round to include the skin with the utmost thoroughness so that not the least root of it remains; let the blood flow and do not stanch it quickly; but put pressure upon the place and squeeze out all the thick blood, either by hand or with any instrument you can.	0.87883496
But if the thick blood contradicts you by cutting a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the blood flow ceases, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.	If in operating you get a very severe haemorrhage from cutting an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops; then dress in the usual way until healed.	0.732958
