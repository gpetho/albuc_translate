 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.
On cauterization of hare lip.
 There often occur fissures in the lip to which are given the name 'hairs'; they are particularly common in the lips of boys.
When you have ineffectually treated these clefts with those things that we have mentioned in their section, then heat a small edged cautery of this shape.
The hollow should be as sharp as a knife.
Then quickly place it, hot, right on the fissure till the burning has reached the depth of the lip.
Then treat with wax plaster till healed.
