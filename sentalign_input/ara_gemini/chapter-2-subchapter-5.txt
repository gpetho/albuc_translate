The fifth chapter on the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from inside the head.
When someone experiences numerous, severe, sharp, and persistent episodes of nasal discharge, and their eyes appear sunken and small, with weakened vision, ulcerated eyelids, and loss of eyelashes, accompanied by a sharp, painful headache deep within the head and continuous sneezing,
know from these symptoms that these substances and discharges originate from numerous deep vessels, and the best treatment for them is the following:
Order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly higher horizontally, starting the incision from the left temple to the right temple, reaching the bone. Keep your hand away from the temple muscles that move during chewing until the bone is exposed. Dry all the blood with a sponge, then separate the edges of the incision with worn cotton or a twisted piece of linen. Then bandage it from above with compresses soaked in wine and oil to prevent the formation of a hot swelling.
When you remove the bandage and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should scrape the bone until the flesh begins to grow. Then treat it with a drying remedy that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, preparing an ointment from them, and using it for flesh growth in such wounds.
