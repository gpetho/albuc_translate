It is therefore necessary that we state in the prologue of this book the main points of the discussion and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.	Before we begin to speak of the fractures and dislocations of individual members we must, as an introduction to this book, give the general and particular information which compels your understanding and your being versed in it; both you and anyone else beside who is eager to learn this noble art.	0.6197581
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary to nourish the patient with foods that make for substantial nourishment, where there is viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow's tripe, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment the fracture heals better and faster.	When the broken bone has begun to mend, the patient should be nourished with very nourishing food, fat, strong, having some glutinous property, such as porridge, rice, heads, trotters, the tripe of cows, eggs, fresh fish, heavy wine, and the like; for on this diet the mending of the fracture will be quicker and better.	0.8762227
And know that the broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot heal or knit well according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor can those who are too tender, such as the bones of small children; but it doesn't matter, replace the broken bone with a large splint which holds and joins the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not stop its work, and for this reason it must be nourished with rich foods, as we have said.	You should know that fractures occurring in mature and old people cannot join and mend into the original condition, on account of the dryness and hardness of their bones; though any bones that are extremely soft, like those of infants, may make a union and heal. Yet nature produces around the bone on all sides something like glue, with a certain viscosity, with whose help it joins, and it binds so that one part adheres to the other and they are linked to one another until it be good and firm as it had been before; so that there is no impediment to any of its functions. It is on this account that the patient's food should be the sort that has solidity and glueyness and thickness, as we have said.	0.8070723
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.	You should know that there are as many different types of fracture as there are members.	0.61177677
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the chest, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes across, and another obliquely, like the cut of a quill for writing.	Thus a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the cranium; and a fracture of the breast bone differs from a fracture of the bone of the back; and similarly there are differences among the other parts. We shall give an exposition of each kind of fracture, each in its own chapter and distinguished from the others.	0.724627
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another obliquely, like the cut of a quill for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small crack. And each type has its own technique, and its own specific instrument for restoration, according to what comes to mind in its place; and the fracture of the bone is known because the place is twisted, and is clearly apparent by default, and sounds when pressed by the hand; and when there is no twisting nor sound when touched, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture; but there can indeed be twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture.	The fracture of each bone also has its own variations; for the fracture may be a clean break without splintering; or the fracture may be along the bone, with splinters and projections which may be sharp or may not; and the fracture may involve a wound and a laceration of the skin; and the fracture may be a crack. Each kind has its own special technique of setting which will be mentioned in detail, each in its place. Among the diagnostic signs of a broken bone are: distortion, protrusion, the aspect of it, and the crepitus when you press on it with the hand. When there is no obvious distortion or crepitus at the site, nor do you feel movement when you manipulate the bone, and the patient does not experience severe pain, there is no fracture there.	0.83733565
So you should not move it with your hand, but apply the medicines that follow, and then bind it carefully immediately.	But it is possible that there is a luxation or a slight fracture or a little crack; so you must not disturb it with any extension or pressure, but apply one of the remedies suitable to the site, such as will be described later; then bind up gently.	0.489594
And know that for the fracture that goes across, and the two parts are separated, you must immediately put them back in place evenly, before a hot abscess develops there; and if a hot abscess develops, leave it for a few days, until the abscess subsides; then set it as evenly as you can easily and wisely, and know that its restoration is easier than the restoration of one where there are fragments; then bind it, as is appropriate below.	If the bone is parted and broken in two and there is no fragmentation but a simple separation of one part from its fellow, then you should lose no time in straightening and aligning it before an abscess sets in. If an abscess does set in, then let a few days pass until it has subsided; then gently and skilfully straighten it in whatever way you can. You should know that the setting or alignment of this is easier than that of a splintered bone. Then bandage as will be prescribed.	0.7845037
And if there are broken pieces in the bone, stretch it from both sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with a cord and your hand; and place the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken limb are separated, bring the pieces back into their place as best you can, and be careful that your work does not cause injury or pain to the patient; and join the two ends of the bones well according to the best form.	But if the bone is splintered, extension from either side is necessary, whether it be hand or foot; with your own hands if it be a small member, or with two ropes or with one hand and a rope. You should place the part on a flat surface in its natural attitude so that when both parts of the broken bone have been extended you can try to restore the fragments to their proper place with all the skill and gentleness possible; and do your utmost to ensure that the patient experience no pain or distress as you operate. Try diligently to get one part of the bone fitted in the best form to the other.	0.89297235
And feel it carefully with your hand if it seems to you that it is not right: then straighten it gently, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do whose work causes a hot abscess and contraction of the limb, as we have often seen.	At the same time you should palpate and investigate both of them with your hand, and if you find anything wrong then mend it and straighten it to the best of your ability. But avoid violent extension or compression which many ignorant people apply; for by doing so they often cause abscess or crippling in the limb, as I myself have many times seen.	0.72407424
And when the limb is set, warn the patient carefully not to move it, neither waking nor sleeping, nor turning, nor in any other way; and make sure that the limb is so secure that he feels no pain.	Then after you have exactly repositioned it and bandaged it, keep that limb still and quiet, and bid the patient beware of moving it while awake or asleep, and in his shifting and stirring, and in opening the bowel, and in every activity, to the utmost of his capacity; and that he should try to let the position of the limb be such that he is free from pain; when pain or distress is felt in any position in which he has disposed the limb, he should move it to a different position in which he feels no pain.	0.8001387
For when he feels no pain, it is not properly set, and it must be placed in such a position that he feels no pain; and be careful that it is placed straight, so that no crookedness occurs when it is healed; and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I tell you.	At the same time he should try to make that position even and straight, so that when the limb is mended there be no curvature in it. As to the way to bandage a broken limb, it is as I shall now describe to you.	0.64890826
Know that broken limbs vary in smallness and size and shape.	You should know that limbs which may be fractured vary in their size and shape.	0.85060424
And if there is swelling or an abscess, apply something soothing and warm for the abscess, and which removes the swelling, and leave it like this for a few days; then tighten your splints, and let them be half the width of a large, wisely cut dogwood branch, or of wood from which arrow shafts are made, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure:	But if there be swelling or effusion in the part, apply something to allay the swelling and disperse the effusion; leave it on for several days and then bind on the splints. The splints should be made of broad halves of cane, cut and shaped with skill; or the splints may be made of the wood used for sieves, which are made of pine; or of palm branches; or of brier or giant fennel or the like, whatever wood be at hand.	0.84791386
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after tightening in healthy places, place linen padding or carded wool underneath them so that he is not injured.	If, after bandaging, the patient is hurt in the sound parts by the ends of the splints, then put a little soft tow or carded wool under them until they no longer hurt him thus.	0.7710762
When the wound is with the fracture, and the skin is broken, I will describe the treatment hereafter.	As for the case of a fracture accompanied by an open wound, it will be mentioned in a special section on its own.	0.49221325
And know that you should not tighten all broken limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, splints should not be applied until after five or seven days, or more depending on your certainty of a hot abscess occurring; and here is the method for ancient plasters to restore fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take the flour that sticks to the walls of the mill, and mix it with plenty of eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common way of making the plaster that restores fractures of many kinds, and especially for women and small children, because it is neither too hot nor too cold.	You should know that not every fracture should be bound up with splints on the first day; that is, when the part is big you should not apply splints until five or seven days after, or more, depending on when you are satisfied that there is no effusion. This is a description of the plasters that the Ancients used for repair, applied to a fracture, dislocation, or sprain. Description of a common simple plaster for the repair of fractures, suited to most constitutions, particularly for women and children, because in it there predominates neither hot nor cold. Take mill-dust, that is, the fine flour that sticks to the walls of a mill as the grindstone moves.	0.8651599
Another method of plaster restoring fracture, dislocation, and sprain: take three units of yellow sweet clover, labdanum, elecampane, and asafetida, and gum arabic, and galbanum, ten units each; myrrh and aloe, five units each; mastic nine units; and make a powder, and mix them with plenty of eggs; if the person's complexion is hot, use this plaster, because it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is beneficial for many people.	Description of another plaster for the repair of a fracture, luxation, or dislocation: take ten drachms each of pulse, gum-mastic, acacia, elecampane, mughath, and sukk; five drachms each of myrrh and aloes; twenty drachms of tamarisk and twenty drachms of clay of Armenia or Asia Minor; all should be pounded fine and mixed with water of tamarisk, or with eggwhite if the patient be of a warm constitution; then use this plaster, which is excellent for uniting, quickly repairing broken bones, and suits most people because of its mildness.	0.8008524
Another kind of plaster that is good for sprains: take galbanum and marshmallow, ten units each; myrrh and aloe, nine units each; acacia six units; Armenian bole ten units, and grind well, and mix with water or plenty of eggs, and administer it.	Description of another plaster valuable for a fracture or sprain: let there be taken ten drachms each of mughath, pulse, and white marsh mallows, five drachms each of myrrh and aloes, six drachms of acacia, and twenty drachms of Armenian clay. Let them all be well beaten up and passed through a sieve and made into a paste with water or egg-white and used.	0.7758106
Another kind of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and soothes the resulting pain, and outgrowth of bone, and fractures: take new wool, and soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply it to the area.	Description of a plaster for dislocated joints or bones, soothing the accompanying pain, and for a crack or fissure of bone: let unwashed wool be taken and soaked in a decoction of oil and vinegar and applied to the place.	0.7315012
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and effectively removes pain.	Now this plaster has no power of repair but it is outstanding for reducing effusion and dispersing pain.	0.73005176
Another kind of plaster that restores broken bones: take dried fig leaves, and ground ivy leaves, and grind them together, and make a plaster.	Description of another plaster for the repair of a broken bone: let there be taken the leaves of the hard fig and of the wild poppy and both be beaten up together and a plaster made of them while still fresh and damp.	0.74583066
Another kind of plaster for the restoration of a bone fracture and to reduce the remains of the abscess. Take marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, vetch flour, one part of each; and grind them, and mix with wine, and if the limb is heated, mix it with moist coriander water, or water, and use it.	Description of another simple plaster used when a fracture is mending and you wish to disperse residual swellings: take one part each of marsh mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and flour of vetch; pound it all and make a paste with decoction of wine, if the part be not inflamed. But if it be inflamed make it up with water of fresh coriander or plain water, and use.	0.81384313
Another kind of plaster, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes during the restoration of the limb. Take marshmallow roots, and flax seed, pomegranate rind, sweet clover, and elderflower, and violet and chamomile flowers, equal parts of all; and grind them, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.	Description of another plaster stronger than the former for resolving, used if a hard swelling arises as the bone sets: let there be taken equal parts of each of marsh mallow roots, linseed, fenugreek, melilot, sweet marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile; they should all be beaten up together and made into a paste with willow infusion or sweet water or wine, according to whether the part is inflamed or its heat has subsided.	0.82702327
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on the fractured limb to restore it anything but a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else more, and says that it should be medium, neither too soft nor too hard.	Now Hippocrates in his book did not mention any application for the repair of a fractured part except a wax plaster made of wax and oil, nothing else. He prescribed that it be of a consistency midway between thick and thin.	0.79315984
And Galen thinks that one should put on the broken limb, to restore it, slightly warm, dry things, such as myrrh and aloe and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.	Galen, on the other hand, thought it good to apply to the broken limb, when it is mending, things which have a certain power of drying, with some heat, such as myrrh, aloes, olibanum, and the sort of thing we have mentioned.	0.8027475
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: take mastic and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and marshmallow root, and salt in equal measure, and grind them, and make a plaster and apply it.	Description of a plaster valuable for debility and pain: let equal parts of each be taken of mughath, chickpease, minced human hair or birds' feathers, marsh mallows and salt; grind it up and pass through a sieve and make into a paste and use as a plaster.	0.7551267
And if you see that the warm abscess and redness and pain and swelling are completely gone, and you need plaster and bandages, then start again, as you did the first time, similarly.	If you see that the effusion, inflammation, pain, swelling, and other symptoms are totally gone, and you need to plaster and bandage it, then repeat just as you did at first.	0.83420616
