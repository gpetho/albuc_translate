Chapter Fifteen: On the Fracture of the Patella
The patella rarely fractures, but it is often subject to bruising.
If it does fracture, it will either be a fissure or a comminuted fracture into pieces.
This can happen with or without a wound.
You can determine all of this by palpation.
Its treatment is to align the separated parts with your fingers until they are joined and fitted together, to the best of your ability, gently and skillfully.
Then apply a bandage, and over it a rounded splint, if needed, and tie it firmly as appropriate.
Then treat all the conditions we have described for other fractures, such as hot swelling and the like, by addressing each symptom with what is appropriate for it until it heals.
