On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
You should know that the hip joint and the muscle joint only suffer dislocation, and they are not affected in the same way as other joints with slight displacement and concavity.
The hip joint can be dislocated in four ways: inward, outward, forward, or backward.
It is mostly dislocated inward, and rarely forward or backward.
The sign of inward dislocation is when you compare the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, it appears longer and the knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards the groin, which is swollen due to a severe abscess because the femoral head has moved there.
The sign of outward dislocation is that the symptoms are opposite to those of inward dislocation.
The sign of forward dislocation is that the leg extends normally but cannot be bent without pain in the knee; if forced to walk, the patient cannot move forward, their urine is retained, the groin is swollen, and they walk on their heel.
The sign of backward dislocation is that the knee cannot be extended or bent forward towards the groin, the affected leg is shorter than the other, the groin is softened, and the femoral head is at that location.
But the reduction of these types of dislocations depends on whether the dislocation is old and longstanding; if it has become chronic, the reduction and retention of it in its place is not effective, so it should not be attempted.
But if the dislocation is recent and is one of the four types, then promptly return the joint by extending it inward and outward, moving it right and left, as it quickly returns to its place and no further treatment is needed.
But if it does not return in this way, prepare a strong assistant to extend the patient's leg from below, either with their hands or with a band tied above the knee; another assistant extends the patient's arm so that their hands are under the armpits; then tighten a strong band around the thigh and have another assistant hold the end of the band.
Extend the leg either inward towards the groin or backward towards the back.
Extend all parts at once until the patient is lifted off the ground and remains suspended.
This type of extension is common to all four types of dislocations.
If the dislocation returns as we have described, it will be good; otherwise, specific treatments will be necessary for each type.
In the specific reduction for inward dislocation, the patient should lie on their healthy side; place the band around the thigh at the spot between the femoral head and the area below the groin; extend the band from the groin to the highest part of the shoulder.
Then, a strong assistant takes hold of the patient's arms, supports the upper part of the affected thigh, and extends it outward with strong traction, causing it to return to its place.
This type of treatment is easier and more effective for reducing this kind of dislocation than the other types.
But if you are uncertain and do not follow this method completely, tie the patient's feet together with a strong, light band around both heels and knees.
Each leg should be tied four fingers apart, with the affected leg extended two fingers more than the other.
Then suspend the patient by the head of the post in the house; the distance from the ground should be two cubits.
Instruct a strong young man to reduce the femoral head, and have another young man suspended with the patient, pushing with force so that the joint quickly returns to its place.
In the specific reduction for outward dislocation, the patient should lie on a cushion as previously described for the yellow disease; tightly wrap the band around the affected leg and chest.
Place two posts, one at the patient's feet and the other at the head; then place posts in the middle of the cushion wrapped with damp cloths to prevent the patient from being harmed by the post between their thighs, ensuring that the extension is not pulled downward.
Each assistant extends their part, and the physician guides the reduction with their hand according to the art.
If the reduction is successful, it will be greatly beneficial; if not, carefully follow the same method as for yellow disease for that alignment.
The patient should lie quietly on their healthy side.
For forward dislocation, the leg should be gently extended in the same way on a cushion; the physician places the palm of their right hand on the affected groin, compressing it with the other hand, and with this compression, extends it downward towards the knee.
For backward dislocation, the patient should not be extended downward but lifted from the ground; they should be placed on a hard surface, as described for outward dislocation, lying on their face with the bands extended as previously mentioned.
Apply compression with a board over the area where the joint protrudes.
When the reduction is properly done — the sign that it is successful is that both legs can be extended equally and the patient can flex and extend the affected leg without pain, indicating the joint has returned to its place — then adjust both thighs, apply a poultice and bandage tightly to keep the hip stable, and let the patient rest for three to four days.
Afterwards, remove the bandage and poultice, and compare one leg with the other.
If the legs appear equal and stable, the dislocation is fixed, and the patient can be allowed to walk.
If there is any sign of softness, reapply the poultice and bandage it tightly as before, and leave it for three days.
Afterwards, remove it and allow the patient to walk gradually over a few days until they are fully strengthened.
