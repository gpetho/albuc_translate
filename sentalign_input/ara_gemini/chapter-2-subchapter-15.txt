The fifteenth chapter is on the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
This adhesion may occur to many people, where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing it from easy movement and hindering its natural functions.
Therefore, you should insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not as sharp as cutting scalpels, but somewhat blunt, so that the patient does not become anxious during the procedure and the scalpel slips and injures the eye with its sharpness.
And your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion, and wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the entire adhesion heals, then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with it, or instill in it a solution of vitriol suppositories dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen wick and place cotton wool soaked in egg white over the eye, and after the third day use desiccating suppositories until it heals.
