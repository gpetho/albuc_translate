O, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, through its completion, its end has been reached, and through its expositions and declarations, it is clear to me that I have completed it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the manual operation, that is, surgery.
Because the manual operation is widespread in our region and time, it is almost entirely private, to the extent that the knowledge of it is greatly endangered, and its practice is obstructed; and only a few small descriptions remain in the books of the Ancients, which have been misinterpreted and have caused error and hesitation, to the point that understanding of it has been lost and the skill has diminished.
And it seems to me that I can revive it [the manual operation] through the organization of this treatise, following the method of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and so that it may come with the forms of cautery instruments and other tools of the craft, as it is by adding to the explanation, and by preparing them, which is necessary.
But the reason why a skilled artisan with a practiced hand is not found in this time of ours is that the art of medicine is extensive, and that its practitioner must previously be versed in the science of anatomy, which encompasses the knowledge of the body's organs and their forms, and their connections and separations; and must know the bones, nerves and muscles, their numbers, and their distribution; and the pulsating and still veins, and the locations from which they emerge.
And therefore Hippocrates said that with one name is meant much, but in the practice it is small, and more so in the art of the hand.
But we have already mentioned this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have stated about anatomy cannot avoid falling into errors that will lead to the deaths of people, just as I have seen many such cases.  Some are trained in this science, yet depart from it without knowledge or experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced physician open an scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and cut some of the arteries in her neck, so that a great deal of blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who thought he should remove a stone from a man who was old, and the stone was large.  He went to him and removed the stone with a piece of the bladder, so that the man died on the third day.
And I myself was called to remove that stone, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew beforehand that he would die.
And I saw another physician who was receiving payment from a duke in our land for surgery, and he treated a dark-skinned man whose leg was fractured; and through his ignorance, the physician improperly set the fracture, placing splints and bandages with excessive tightness, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he (the physician) treated it according to his desires, and then he bound it, and then he left it for some days and commanded that we loosen the bandage.  And it remained like that until the leg and foot became abscessed, and resulted in death.
And I was called to him, and I prepared to loosen the bandage, and tranquility was achieved and he was relieved of his pains.
But meanwhile, corruption had already taken hold in the limb, so I could not stop it, and the corruption continued to spread in the limb until the patient died.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and it festered for a few days, until the severity of the illness increased with the patient's suffering.
Because the cancerous tumor is purely made of melancholic humor, it is not appropriate to treat it with iron altogether, but rather to target the limb that suffers most from its presence.
And therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the operation with the hands be divided into two parts: one is the operation that is associated with health, and the other the work that entails danger in the most serious cases.
And I have already highlighted this throughout this book in which operations are fraught with error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to guard against this and abandon it, lest the pages find a way to speak and discredit you.
Therefore, take your tools with diligence and with God's protection, and your patients with ease and firmness.
And use the best method, through God's grace, aiming for health and laudable success, and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult healing, and remove from your arsenal whatever makes you fear, so that your reputation and your name are not tarnished: for it is more important to your glory, and higher in the world, and later to your holiness.
Gualia already said in some of his pronouncements: Do not treat a serious illness, lest you be called bad doctors".
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter, ordered from head to foot, on the forms of instruments and the tools for cauteries, and what is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on cutting and piercing, and cupping, and cauteries, and the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting and similar injuries; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and concerning the forms of instruments.
It is necessary for me to describe the benefits of this cauterization and its harms, and in what constitution cauterization is forbidden.
Therefore I say that the discussion of the benefits and harms of cauterization is long and drawn out, subtle in its science, and a hidden secret; and already a great multitude of wise men have spoken of it, disagreeing on it, but I will suffice with a small portion of their discussions, fearing to be too lengthy.
And therefore I say that cauterization is beneficial to all constitutions universally, whether with or without material causes, except for two constitutions, which are hot constitutions without material causes.
In the hot and dry constitution with material causes, there is disagreement; for some say that cauterization is helpful in that case, and others say the opposite, that cauterization is not appropriate for an illness characterized by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is inappropriate for a hot and dry illness to be treated with something that is hot and dry.
And those who say the opposite argue that cauterization is beneficial in all hot and dry illnesses affecting the human body, because when you compare the human body and its humours to the constitution of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I say, concerning this matter, that experience has shown me this to be true on several occasions.
However, this should not be taken as a final word on the subject by someone who is already skilled and experienced in the practice of cauterization, having learned about the diversity of human constitutions, the nature of illnesses themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and the proper timing for treatment.
But in other constitutions, there is no need for such caution, especially in cold and moist illnesses, for all physicians have agreed upon their treatment and do not disagree about the use of cauterization in those cases.
And know, children, that the secret of healing by cauterization with fire, and its effectiveness, is due to cauterization using fire as a medicine which is more effective, because fire is simple, its effect reaching only the part being cauterized and not harming other connected parts except with minor damage.
However, the action of a burning medicine reaches the parts of the body further away from it, and easily causes a difficult-to-heal illness and substantial harm.
But fire, due to its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this; rather, it is redundant.  And this is known to us through experience and long study of the art, the truth of causes; therefore I am excused from a lengthy discourse. And if it were not for the fact that this is not appropriate for a book on this matter, the secret of the use of fire, and the method of its operation within the body, and the expelling of diseases, would be demonstrated by a philosophical discourse, which would be more useful to you.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time when cauterization is best, and consider the spring the most favorable time.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at all times, because the harm caused by the passing of time is outweighed by the benefit derived from the cauterization, especially if the cauterization is for painful or necessary ailments, severe and sudden, which cannot tolerate delay, since the fear of greater harm resulting from the passage of time outweighs the minor harm from the cauterization itself.
And this is not understood by you, children, or is not valued by the common people and foolish doctors, which is that a disease cured by cauterization is not always a return to health, and they ignore this consequence.
And the reason is not at all as they believe, for cauterization is only a means of medicine that alters the temperament and dries the moistures which cause the pain.
However, cauterization is superior to other medicine because of its power, the effectiveness of its action, and the greatness of its effect.
And it is possible that the ailment will return at some point in time, according to the temperament of the patient, the location of the illness, the patient's constitution, and the accumulation of superfluities within them, and what they have acquired through their diet and similar causes; however, if the illness for which cauterization was administered is a subtle ailment of a limb with few superfluities and moistures, similar to a toothache and the like, then it is possible that the pain will not return, but this happens with small amounts.
And a common saying is that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, and it is a true statement, not for what they understand by it, for they believe that there is no cure that benefits with medicine or any other treatment before cauterization.
But the opposite is true; the idea that cauterization is the last resort in medicine is only when we have tried other methods of treatment for certain illnesses, and those medicines have not been effective, and finally, cauterization is applied, and it benefits from that. And therefore, cauterization being the last resort in medicine is not according to the understanding of common people and many foolish doctors.
And the ancients would say that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they did not say this except for the equivalence of gold and the nobility of its substance.
And they would say that the place where the cauterization is done does not matter, though this is not entirely true, for I have tested this and found that it only holds for some bodies and not others, and cauterization with gold is good and better than with iron, as they said; however, when you do cauterization with gold, it is not entirely clear to you, for it is heated according to the amount that you want by the heat of the gold, and it is prepared to receive cold; and if you add more fire, the gold melts due to the fire, and some pieces fall into the fire, and so the artisan may be harmed by the process.
Therefore, cauterization with iron is done more easily and more properly for the correctness of the operation.
And I have organized this chapter on cauterization according to sections, and I have arranged them from the head to the feet, so that the patient may find what they desire.
The first chapter.
This cauterization is effective against dampness and coldness affecting the brain, the causes of which are twofold:  a cause of phlegm and a multitude of rheumatic fluxes, called cold, running from the head to the eye and ear areas; a multitude of sleeping problems; toothaches and throat pain; and generally all illnesses caused by cold, such as paralysis, apoplexy, and similar maladies.
The method of this cauterization is as follows:  first, instruct the patient to be purged with laxative medicine, thoroughly cleansing the head, for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and custom.
Then instruct them to shave their head, and then position them on a smooth bench with their hands resting on their feet.
And then place the blade of your palm, close to the bridge of the nose, between their eyes. However, when the middle finger has reached the spot, mark the area with a branding iron, and then apply the oiled cautery, the method for which is as follows:
And then apply that [cautery] to the marked spot, in a descending manner, with your hand gradually tightening and turning it.
And then lift your hand slightly and examine the area.  If you see a significant amount of bone exposed, about the size of a grain of millet, then lift your hand, and if not, re-apply the iron, another one if necessary, until you see what I have described.
Then take a bit of salt and dissolve it over the area, and leave it for three days.
Then place a cloth soaked in broth over it and leave it until the scab from the cautery is gone. Then treat the area with a four-herb ointment until it is healed.
And if the wound remains open, the arm should be lifted, for this is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the bone should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the bone tissue is charred.
And then that which is charred of the bone should be scraped off, and then it should be healed.
And others say that with the cautery, one should reach the back, so that it presses hard on the bone until the bone breaks, and this is the method of a small cauterization. And they believe that vapors from the head are released from that location.
And let the wound be kept open for a long time, and then be treated until it is healed and consolidated.
However, I have not seen these two types of cauterization in all cases, but only in some individuals, according to the route of caution; and in my opinion, it is better to preserve health, when possible; for the head is weakened by a disruption of its continuity, just as we have witnessed in other parts of the body, especially when the patient's head is of a fragile nature.
And the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion; and by this method and this work, health is preserved.
Second Chapter.
Of cauterization of the head.
When a chronic and prolonged headache afflicts the patient, and they have used leeches, cupping, head purges, plasters, washes, poultices, and similar remedies, and especially if they have already been cauterized with a cauterization technique that doesn't benefit them, then consider if the patient's head is of strong constitution, not fragile, and is experiencing extreme cold, then one should cauterize with another cauterization technique slightly below the previous one. And then cauterize that area above the patient's temple with a cautery until the inflammation is broken. Incise the inflammation and expose the bone, the quantity of which we have described, and cauterize it with a cautery in the back part of the head, in the area called the *vas* (vein) – and this is the area where a cupping vessel is placed. And ease your hand in doing this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience very great pain different from the pain of all other head cauterizations.
And I will describe this cautery in its place, for the cautery used for cauterizing the temples and the back of the head must be a finer cautery than the one used for cauterizing the middle part of the head; and this is the method for it.
Third Chapter.
Concerning the cauterization of non-ancient migraine.
When, in the head's area, there is persistent or spreading pain extending to the eye, the head should be cleansed with medicines, and the other treatment I have described in my discussion of illnesses should be administered.  If this does not help, cauterization is performed in two ways: either with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is when you take an onion, squeeze it, and cut the ends off both of its ends. Then, using a sharp lancet, cut the painful area on the temple until a small depression is created beneath the skin, until it is hidden.
Then, press on it with a bandage to constrict the area, and leave it for three hours. Then, remove it and take away the onion, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then apply cotton soaked in butter until the area heals.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines, which I have written in the second treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron according to this method:  apply fire for cauterization, of which this is the form:
and it is called a 'nail' (or 'clavilh'), because its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small eminence.
Then place it over the painful area, and hold your hand—so that the surrounding flesh is not burned—and turn the small iron slowly and with speed.
And if the amount burned by the intensity of the cautery is about half of it, then lift your hand to prevent the underlying artery from being burned, so that no blood flow occurs.
Then soak cotton in salt water and place it over the area, and leave it for three days; then place cotton moistened with butter, and then treat with ointment until healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the blade of a knife (like a cautery), and be careful not to cut an artery in this particular, not-ancient, form of migraine.
Fourth Chapter.
Concerning the cauterization of ancient migraine.
When you treat a migraine with what we have described in the previous treatment, and what we have discussed in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment is ineffective, and sometimes the illness prevents the patient from benefiting from what we have previously described - the first cauterization with medicine or with fire - then you should heat the knife cautery until it glows white-hot, then apply it to the pain area in a line of half a finger's length, or as needed;  and place your hand there once, pressing firmly until you cut into the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to harm the continuity of the jaw, which is strained by chewing, and that the ligament and nerves that control it are not damaged, and that spasm does not result.
And if it concerns the guarding and caution against blood flow from the severed artery, for there is fear in its severance, especially for one who is ignorant of what they are doing and is not skilled and experienced; and leaves the operation unfinished at the start.
And I will come back to the treatment of accidental blood flow from the artery in its proper manner in its place in this book.
And if you see that this treatment is not sufficient for this ailment, and the patient's condition appears tolerable, cauterize the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, apply the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on artery constriction with a cautery having two blades; this is a better and more beneficial cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the cauterization of earaches.
When an earache is caused by cold and is treated with laxatives and the other remedies mentioned in the division, and the pain persists, then apply the cautery, and this is the one called *puncta*, whose shape is as follows:
And then, apply the heated cautery point by point around the entire ear, moving in a circular motion, or in sections if the pain is localized in a specific area. Move the cautery along the base of the ear slowly, after marking the location with a probe.
And if the cautery has ten points across the whole ear, use that many, and then treat the affected areas until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
On the cauterization of tumors.
Tumors that are cured by cauterization are only of the types that arise from phlegm, as we have stated in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type caused by dryness or nerve spasm.
When you treat that type of tumor with poultices, purges, and remedies, and your treatment is ineffective, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, a second one a little below the temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery opposite the diseased area, for softening occurs only on the area that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery at the right of the ear's extremity, slightly above the corner of the head, and another one at the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the index finger, and hold the cautery until the affected area has been burned to half its thickness.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of surgical instrument, the form of which is described before. However, it is even more subtle than that which you see; and it is necessary to cut away some of the superfluous thickness in that area.
And then treat the area with what was previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
On the cauterization of old apoplexy.
When apoplexy is longstanding and you have treated it with what we have said, and you do not see improvement in the treatment, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize with four cauteries: on all the corners of the head; and with a cautery on the middle part of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the jaw. And the method of cauterization is done as described above.
And it has already been cauterized on the opening of the stomach; and further back; and then it should be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
Concerning cauterization for forgetfulness caused by flame.
Large jars and pills, which cleanse the brain, should be given to the patient at the beginning.
And then shave the patient's entire head and apply a plaster of ceter, as described in the treatise on plasters, to their temples.
And apply that several times, for that is a form of cautery. And do this according to the same order that I have already stated.
And so, if that is a good cure, then do this.  But if not, then make three cauteries on the back part of their head, descending from the highest part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. And place the width of a finger between each cautery, and then treat the cautery with whatever was previously mentioned.
However, if the application is slight and the patient tolerates it, then make the cautery in the middle; and if there is greater need, then cauterize that area over the two horns.
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the cautery be oiled, according to the form previously given.
Chapter 9.
Concerning cauterization for paralysis and the softening of the entire body.
You should proceed with cleansing the head with herbs and as previously described; then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on each horn of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of the head, and with three cauteries on the spinal vertebrae of the neck.
And if, in the illness of softening of the body, the patient is particularly weak and the illness is severe, then cauterize with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and continuously with a cautery until the pain has lessened significantly, and lift your hand. And then treat him until he is healed, and this should be an olive oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Of cauterization for epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless the epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to modify his brain at the beginning, using herbs and other treatments we have described in the division when the patient is seriously ill and tolerates the use of strong medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate the medicines, then administer remedies and mastigators that modify the brain, beforehand for several days, with the proper preparation of foods.
And then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery at the back of the head, and cauterize on each temple (horn of the head). And if the illness is severe and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize the patient with the cauteries I have described, having simultaneously paralysis and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
Let the cautery be olive-shaped, as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then use a gentle cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
On the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humidity and a large flame, then cauterize it with the cauteries that we have described in the previous paralysis section.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink what cleanses his brain, according to what has been previously stated in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, and then carefully apply a properly made torquet to it around the circumference, and then place it over the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated securely, and held firmly in all parts.
And then apply a liniment; and it is better to use an old sheep's wool. And heat that over a fire with a measured, moderate heat, which the said person can tolerate when it is placed upon them. And then pour it onto the center of their head, inside the circle, and leave it until it has cooled.
And do this to the patient once a week, with the rest of their treatment, until they are healed; or if you wish, cauterize that area by making small points according to their ability, holding the hand with a cautery that is thus ordered: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain equally.
And then place that cloth soaked in wool or hen's grease.
Chapter 12.
Of the cauterization of descending water in the head.
When you have determined the beginning of water in the head by the signs I have described in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink that which will dry the head, and protect it from all moisture.
And make him sweat in a bath for several days.
And then command him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle part of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on both temples if the beginning of water-disease is in both ears, or on one side if the beginning of the water-disease is in one ear.
Cut with cauteries all the veins and arteries which are below the scalp; and let the cauteries be of that length in the width of the temples.
And watch out for blood flow when it is cauterized; and if you see blood flow from it, stop it with any medicine that is possible for you.
And I will come with the skill that is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of those and the precaution against blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck below two bones with two cauteries directly applied.
Chapter 13.
Of the cauterization of old sores/wounds.
When sores on the face are old, persistent, and run through the veins and arteries visible on the outside of the head, and it is verified that this is due to cold phlegmatic superfluities, then cauterize it with the cautery we described in the chapter on hot water compresses for sores, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries on the neck below the temples, and with two cauteries on the neck below the bones. And if more treatment is needed, then cauterize along the entire edge of the sore on the eyebrow's extremity with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Of the cauterization of nasal discharge/foul odor.
If your treatment using the methods we discussed is ineffective, then prepare and give the patient a potion to drink for three nights; then shave the patient's head and cauterize it with a middling cautery and an olive cautery. And then cauterize it with a clove cautery, using two cauteries on the two eyebrows below the hair, a small one.
And be careful not to set it on fire.
And this is the method for the clove cautery.
Chapter 15.
Of cauterization for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery using this lunar cautery; and this is its method:
And if you, cauterize that slightly on both eyebrows, using two cauteries on each spot, and keep them spaced from the temples. And the length of each cautery should be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand with the cautery too hard, but just enough so that the third part of the eyelid is adhered.
Chapter 16.
Of cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are turned inwards and the eye is inflamed.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward, causing inflammation of the eye, cauterization in such cases is done in two ways: either with a cautery iron or with a burning medicine.
If with a cautery of fire, instruct the patient beforehand to shave the hairs as those who clean them, until they are lengthened and straightened; and if the inflammation is near the roots of the hair, then you should press the patient's eyes with a bandage so they don't move until the hair has grown back.
So, once the hairs are grown back and straightened, then place the patient's head on your lap, and gently apply a cautery to the eyelid of their eye using a probe, whose shape should be similar to a myrtle leaf, starting the cautery near the hairs.
And then place cotton soaked in egg white or in a ptilli mucilage over the eye.
And then apply the cautery, of which this is its form/shape.
And then cauterize, little by little, in several applications, over the area you marked, until the surface of the inflamed area, which is roughly the shape of a myrtle leaf, is completely charred.
The sign of successful treatment is that you see the eyelid drawn together and the hairs rising towards the puncture in the eye.
And then lift your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with a border over it until the scab has healed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if, due to some cause, hair growth returns near the origin and the eyelid softens, then apply the cautery again in the same manner as you did at first.
But if the hairs are under the eyelid, then cauterize it until they are raised to their natural position, healed, and the hairs no longer irritate the eye.
But the cautery with burning medicine that you prescribe to the patient involves pulling the hairs out until they are elongated and healed, and then a piece of cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf should be applied.
And then take known herb and fresh living vinegar, or whatever is appropriate, and thoroughly mix these ingredients quickly so they don't get cold.  Then spread this mixture onto the cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place this over the affected eye(s).  Place a cloth soaked in albumen of an egg under the eye, and the patient's head should be supported.
And press the cloth onto the medicine, pressing it gently, but do not remove it until the patient feels the medicine's burning sensation, for the burning sensation is like that of fire.
And thus, as long as the patient feels the burning sensation, leave the medicine in place.  Then, when the burning sensation stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.  Then consider if the eyelid is now raised as it should be, without constriction from fire or incision. If so, it is well done. If not, return to applying the medicine to the affected area and continue until the healing is complete, and the eye is closed.
Then apply a cloth over the area until the burn's inflammation has subsided, and then treat it with a healing ointment or other appropriate remedy until it is healed.
It is necessary for you, during your treatment, to carefully watch that nothing of the medicine gets into the eye.  And if after a few days the eyelid becomes softened and something of the hair or skin gets into the eye, then reapply your medicine to the softened area of the eyelid, just as you did at the beginning, and continue until it heals.
And this is the method of using myrtle leaf.
Know that human eyes differ in size and thus the treatment for their condition is adjusted accordingly.
And the path to recovery for the one who studies this art will not be hidden.
Chapter 17.
Of the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula, as we have discussed in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment doesn't work, then you should cauterize it in this way: instruct the patient to rest their head on your lap, and have an assistant hold the patient's head between your hands, so that it is neither moved nor agitated by their head movements.
And then place a piece of cotton, soaked in egg white or phlli gum, over their eye.
And then heat the cautery, whose form is:
which should be hollow, like the shape of a reed or a hawk's feather, at the end from which the cautery is made.
And if you wish, let it penetrate to the other end. And if you wish, let it be slender, like a probe.
However, the one that is hollow is better for your work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and drain and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and remove the pus from it.
And then place the heated cautery on it, and hold your hand a short distance from the cautery, near the nostril, so that your hand or the patient is not disturbed, and then place the cautery on the ulcer and cauterize it.
And therefore, if at the beginning your cautery penetrates to the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it thus for three days, and then apply a bandage with lint and surround it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if more than ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is scraped as appropriate in your chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier practitioners described:  Apply pressure to the fistula opening and make it wider. Then place a thin piece of lead, shaped as is described, into that opening; hold it in place with your hand firmly, so that the molten lead does not enter the wound; you should apply a bandage soaked in egg white or water to the patient's wound, as the lead will adhere to the fistula opening and heal it, bringing remarkable recovery.
And if the fistula is healed by the cauterization and treatment we have described, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a perforation of the nose and reduce the fistula back into the nasal passage, according to its proper location.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the cauterization of a fissure in the pot/cavity.
Often fissures occur in the lips, especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have described in the divisions, and your treatment is not successful, then heat the small, knife-like cautery according to this method that follows:
And its cavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then carefully place that heated cautery on those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat it with a plaster until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Of cauterization of fistulas in the mouth.
When an abscess forms at the base of the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, and it breaks, and then becomes chronic, and pus forms and a fistula is created, and you treat it but the treatment doesn't work, then you must apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula opening.  Place the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand there until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it. This is done once or twice. Then treat it with the methods we've previously discussed for healing until it is healed.
And therefore, if the pus is expelled and healed, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the damaged bone, as will be described in its appropriate chapter.
Chapter 20.
Of cauterization of the teeth and softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are decayed, and treatment with medicines does not help, then place the patient's head on your lap.  Then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be explained here.  Position the cannula over the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it. Hold your hand there for a short time, so that the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and repeat the cauterization a few times, as desired.
Then have the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  For the decayed tooth is sealed, the softened gums are strengthened, and the corrupt moisture is dried out.
Chapter 21.
Of cauterization for toothache.
When toothache is caused by cold, or there is cold or a worm in it, or you do not consider medicine a cure, then cauterization in that case is done in two ways: either with a cow's dung cautery, or with fire.
Cauterization with dung is done by taking cow dung, boiling it in an iron pot, then taking a piece of cloth, wrapping it around the end of a probe, dipping it into the boiled dung, and quickly placing it on the aching tooth until it is cooled.
And repeat this several times until the heat's effect reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cloth in the aforementioned dung, place it on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron upon it until the iron reaches the hollow of the tooth.
However, cauterization with fire is that you use a heated iron or bronze cannula, ensuring that its thickness is sufficient to prevent the heat from reaching the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery, shaped appropriately, and place it on the tooth, holding it until the cautery cools; repeat this several times, as the pain will either cease that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, during the application of the cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good dung and hold it for an hour, then spit it out; and this is the method of cauterization.
And cauterize whichever extremity you are able to.
And this is the form of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Concerning the cauterization of extrophulos.
When extrophulos are caused by phlegm and cold humors, and are not responding to digestion through medicine, and you desire to ease their digestion, then you heat the cautery, the shape of which is as follows: having two open ends so that smoke escapes from the cautery through the other end. Place this heated cautery on the abscess once, and again if needed, until it reaches the core of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and apply a cloth soaked in butter over it until what the fire has burned is resolved.
And then treat it with ointment, bandages, and cloths until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
On cauterization of sore throats and constrictions of the windpipe.
When humidity affects the airway, and especially when it's due to a cold temperament, the patient should first be relieved with laxative medicines, and then cauterize the area near the base of the throat, in the affected spot.
And be careful not to touch the throat with the cautery, or to burn the lining of it too much, only a little.
And cauterize it with another cautery near the collarbone, at the back of his spine. And the cautery should be a sharp, pointed instrument, in the manner previously described.
And then treat it with what was previously mentioned until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung ailments and coughs.
When coughs and lung illnesses are caused by cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the illness is chronic, then cauterize the area with two cauteries on the furcula, in the hollowed-out, distant, and elevated areas; and with another cautery in the middle area of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be pointed according to the previous form.
And if you wish, your cauterization can be done by puncturing with the cautery called a "puncta," the form of which is previously described in the puncturing of earaches.
And let there be punctures into those areas; and then treat that with the same methods as previously described until it is healed.
And the cautery should have three points, because cauterization is done with it: with one application, you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter 25.
Of cauterization of the titillic, which is the head of the help/aid.
When the head of the help/aid is dislocated due to lubricating humidity and is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation until it is back in place, and then through a slight movement it is dislocated again as it should, as we have witnessed, then you must first reduce the dislocation, and then turn the patient on their back or on their side; and then raise the tendon which is in the inner part of the titillic to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated towards the inner parts.
And then apply the cautery having two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the tendon until it penetrates to the other side; and the figure of cauterization will then be of four-headed cauteries.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore the cauteries are eight.
And then place a poultice of cooked salt over the cauterization, and then have the patient rest, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done, then cauterize the muscle with a pointed cautery or several pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened and the moisture is removed and the patient is cured.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and excessive moisture enter the stomach, causing it to lose its proper constitution and multiply in it, and if you continue the treatment and do not achieve the desired effect, the patient should lie on their back, extend their arms and legs, and then cauterize the area with three cauteries: one under the foot for the space of a fingertip with a pointed cautery, and two other cauteries below the two sides of the area, until a triangular cauterization pattern forms; and prolong between them, so that they don't close up too quickly.
And if the depth of the cauterization is the quantity of two-thirds of the thickness of the cord.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without additions. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle area of the stomach according to this shape; and let this be a cautery in the form of a circle, according to this shape:
And cauterize the stomach by puncturing it, that which is frightened by this cautery:  and pierce the stomach with a probe at the amount you wish, and then cauterize that with the cautery at the points; and then cure it with the previous treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Of cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain in the liver arises from coldness, or humidity, or excessive windiness, until its normal condition is expelled through a superfluity, and the patient is treated with what we have described and is not relieved, then it is necessary that the patient be placed supine on their back, and pierce three cauteries according to this shape and the same size over the liver beneath the hypochondria, where the human's recumbent position is found.
And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, and the cauteries should be the length of a right-hand's span.
And do not burn excessively with the cautery.
And if the amount cauterized is half the size of a fingertip, and no more is applied; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then they should be lying down, with their legs spread out, and their arms raised.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-cautery, when you possess the subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed too far in the cauterization, and that the area the size of a fingertip is cauterized so that the entire body is affected and reaches the intestines, for the fingertip is delicate here; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When there is a swelling or abscess in the liver, and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane, if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient experiences severe, sharp pain.
And if it is in the membrane of the liver, the pain is intense and sometimes doctors are already exhausted in trying to cure it.
Therefore, the patient should be turned on their side; then, locate the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a rod, the shape of which has been shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is burned away, until it reaches the core, until healthy tissue is exposed.
And then treat that, as with other abscesses, until it is healed.
And one should only use this type of cautery if the study of medicine has prolonged experience with it, and many illnesses have been cured with it.  However, sometimes a surgeon may be bold with this procedure. Nonetheless, let us leave it to more experienced practitioners; it is better that way.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cauterizing the roots of aristolochia for pleurisy cold according to this method is effective.  Take a long, dry root of aristolochia, finding one that is pointed and about the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and heat it over a fire.  Cauterize the area between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck with a cautery.  Use two smaller cauteries, slightly angled downwards toward the lower part of the beard, and two cauteries angled a little behind the fifth and sixth ribs.  Place another cautery in the middle of the foot; one on the stomach; and three on the back. Another cautery in the area between the two shoulder blades and two on the sides of the foot, below the cautery between the shoulder blades.
And do not burn your hand with the cautery, rather, let it be in the open air, as opposed to directly on the body.
And some ancients said that some people use an iron cautery, shaped like a ray, and heat it, placing it on the area between the ribs until they reach the abscess, causing the pus to drain, just as we described for the abscess of the liver.
However, this cauterization is not without risk, for you might accidentally create a fistula in the area, which will not heal.
Chapter 30.
Of the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat spleen disease using the methods described in the section on treatment, and your treatment is not successful, then cauterization of the area can be performed in three ways, all of which are proper.  One method is to make three or four lines of cauterization along the length of the spleen, following the pattern of the liver cauterization previously described.
And the distance between each cauterization should be about the width of a finger or slightly more, and the method of cauterization should be the same as described for cauterizing the liver.
And do not press your hand against the cautery; and let the patient lie on their back.
Another method of cauterization is to use a cautery with two jets of fire, a method described in the chapter on muscle dislocation.  Raise the arm on the side of the spleen, the side where the patient is lying.
And the elevation of the arm should be such that it extends along the length of the body, so that cauterizations are made along the width of the body.
Then introduce the two jets of fire, quite intensely, into that space, so that they penetrate the arm on the other side.
Then remove the cautery; and thus four cauteries have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three jets of fire.
And then you should treat the cautery, as it has stopped emitting fire for too many days, for this is more important than the other preceding actions in the cure.
Chapter 31.
Of the cauterization of dropsy patients.
Cautery is not applied to dropsy patients, but only to those with ascites properly.
When you treat a dropsy patient using the methods we have described in the division, and your treatment does not improve the condition, then it is necessary to cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, one cautery on the right side of the chest, and another on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportional to the sharpness of the cautery iron.
And then leave the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment near the cautery with what is necessary, so that two intentions may be added to him, and his healing will be hastened by aid.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be a wedge, following the shape of the one above it.  The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the back should be an olive shape, similar to the preceding one.
Chapter 32.
Of cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed with dropsy and filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, between the auricular and anular bones, and lift the cautery with your hand, do not twist it.  Then lift your hand, but do not completely withdraw it, for the yellow water will drain.
The cautery should be shaped like this:  Then, apply two cauteries to both thighs, and on each thigh use a knife-like tip of the cautery. And the cautery should be positioned along the length of the thigh: one below the knee, and another below the middle of the thigh; and two cauteries on each thigh.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time, so that any remaining water drains from it.
And then treat it with those things we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
Of cauterization of the belly (or abdominal) area.
When the belly is affected by cold and moisture, weakening the digestive and retentive virtues—which reside in the stomach and intestines—this is treated with the methods of healing and not with the use of remedies.  And sometimes the patient's suffering, showing the need, demands cauterization. In such cases, cauterize the affected area with a large cautery on their stomach, following the procedure previously described for cauterizing the stomach. Use a circular cautery, plus four cauteries in a circle around the navel, one fine pointed cautery. Further, use a cautery on the lower abdomen, in a larger or a smaller area, or two cauteries.
And if sometimes the excessive moisture is evident and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize the affected area on the groin and on the intestines, placing two cauteries strongly near the stomach and the groin area.  This is a perfect cure and a useful treatment, from which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
Of cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When old hemorrhoids are caused by thick, cold humors or corrupted moisture, and they have not been cured by the methods mentioned in the previous section, then cauterize with three cauteries on the inflamed area just below the small of the back (spine), and a triangular cautery slightly above the navel, situated in a two-finger space.
And if you suspect the patient's stomach is cold and their food is not digesting properly, and their face is sometimes inflamed, then cauterize the area above the stomach with a large cautery, as previously described; and place one cautery on the liver and another on the spleen using a pointed cautery, leaving the cautery open for a period, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of cauterization of a boil before its excision.
When you excise a boil, then you heat the cautery that is shaped like a ray. Then, insert that heated cautery into the excised boil, and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do this once or twice; for if there are many boils, then cauterize each of them as we have described, and then treat them with the ointments that you prescribe until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery over a large area, it is more harmful than helpful.
Chapter 36.
On the cauterization of fistulas that have formed naturally in various parts of the body.
When nature does not respond to the treatment we have described in its place, and the patient is distressed by it, it should be treated with cauterization.
Therefore, when someone has a naturally occurring fistula, and it is old, with festering pus and corrupt moisture, and therefore, what is most fitting to do is to probe it with a thin probe, and then determine the depth of the fistula with the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery, which should resemble a rod. And then place that heated cautery into this fistula, according to the depth of the probe's penetration.
And repeat the application of the cautery until those corrupted tissues are burned, once, twice, or three times, depending on your need.
And be careful not to burn any nerves or veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or the bowels, avoid those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area and you believe it is not deep-seated.
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the matter has been cut away from it, and remains this way for a long time, then know that it is completely healed.
And if the matter is not removed, then know that it is deep-seated or in a pre-existing corrupted area, or that this condition arises from causes that will return to the same place.
Chapter 37.
Of cauterization of the kidneys.
When the kidneys have pain due to cold or excessive windiness, and this causes the patient's body to be inflamed, then it is necessary to cauterize that area on the kidneys with a cautery iron on each kidney, with a pointed cautery iron, the use of which will recall the remedy.
And lightly cauterize with the second a little below, so that three cauteries will be lined up, and thus will be more effective in relieving the pain.
Chapter 38.
Of cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize the affected area just below the bladder, where the pubic hairs begin, and cauterize with one iron on the right side and another on the left side of the patient.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the depth of the wound; and cauterize this area with one cautery on the lowest part of the wound, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a pointed one, as is customary.
Chapter 39.
Of cauterization of the mother.
When cold and dampness enter the womb, and therefore pregnancy is forbidden, and her menses are corrupted, and their discharge is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then the place should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said for cauterization of the bladder; and with one cautery on the lowest part of the wound, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be pointed.
Chapter 40.
Of cauterization of the dislocation of the ankle.
When viscous moisture has infiltrated the ankle joint, causing it to leave its proper place, and a sign of this is that the joint is extended over the other when compared to them. And the location of the dislocation is found where it bulges.
Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient's ankle with a circular cautery, after you have marked the circumference of the affected area with a probe, so that the area falls within the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the shape used in cauterizing the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available, then cauterize it with three large olive-shaped cauteries.
And let the cauterization be done according to the severity of the entire condition; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
Of cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes to the area of the back, and it is caused by cold and dampness, if the illness is cured by what we have said and not otherwise, and this is old-fashioned, then you should rid the patient of the thick humors with fetid pills or artificial pills or similar; and then cauterize the area.
And the method of cauterization in that case is in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
There are two known methods.  One is to cauterize the affected area of the back with three triangular cauteries in this shape; and make them a good depth. And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, whether the cautery is small or large.
But sometimes the cautery is placed in the middle area, on the top of the back, so there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle, whose shape is previously described in the cauterization of a dislocated back, so that the circle is continuous and burns the thickness of the entire spine.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica, when the pain is attached to the back and does not extend into the thigh.
However, if it extends into the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, over the area where the patient feels the pain; and with one cautery on the shin, about four fingers' width from the outside edge.
And if the cautery is a knife, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the spine.
And if the patient feels the pain extending to the area near the toes, then cauterize there, where they feel it, with three or four points, or more if needed.
And if the patient feels pain below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize that area with a knife cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations that you do not burn nerves or large arteries, lest this cause the patient harm or contraction.
And I have seen others who cauterized near the ankle, and in the cauterization, the leg became swollen until the swelling reached the foot, and the foot was perforated and corrupted. And then a severe abdominal solution (or release) occurred, and after that, death.
And if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each part according to this method.
And some learned men say in the cauterization of the anus, a cautery of this kind: make something resembling a ring of iron, whose circumference is half a palm; and let it be near its opening, according to the thickness of a date seed or slightly less.
And within that ring, place another third (ring); and let the space between them be the size of a fist; and let those rings be open in two parts; and let the length of those parts be one or two fists, and make in those iron bars properly fitted into the rings; and this is their shape:
Then heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then place it on the affected area of the anus, the patient lying on their side. And thus cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
And then leave that for three days; then plaster it with a bandage and leave the wound open for several days; and then cure it with ointments until it is healed.
Albucasis says:  Oh, children, we have used this type of cautery little because of the fear of its effect, and because few have been found to recover using it.
But of the good cauteries, those who endure them, and find the location with it.
But cauterization with adhering medicines is that you make two circles, having a perforated instrument in which you leave the iron gate latch; let the length of the wall's height be two nuts or wedges.
And if the spaces between each are the size of a finger's width; and they are open below and above, and are to contain themselves within each other in this way:
And then place the patient lying on their right side over the affected area, and place your hand on the affected area; and then take hot water and pour it between the two circles, and the heat of it should be gradually increased using a small fire, and keep it for about an hour, and let the patient endure the burning and the cauterization—for it produces a burning sensation like that of fire—until the burning ceases.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and wash the hot water from the entire area with fresh water.
And then leave it for three days and apply a bandage over it until the blackening from the cauterization is gone, and leave it for several days, and calluses will form; this is the final treatment.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a poultice there containing water, similar to what is done on the affected area.
And this is the method of hot water, and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of remedies. Take a part of alkali and an equal part of extinguished lime.  Grind them and place them in a new pot, the bottom of which has a small hole, according to the quantity needed to enter the affected area.
Place another, glazed pot underneath the bottom of the first pot. Pour soft water over the alkali and lime, pouring it in a trickle. Then, use your hand to thoroughly compress the mixture. Allow the pot to drip off the excess water into the glazed pot beneath.
Then collect all that water and pour it over fresh lime and alkali.  This will then have a very strong caustic quality, used in many medical procedures and cauterization of other parts, since the process uses fire.
And some of the medicines used in cauterization include:  tincture of cinnamon, honey, and lime with a salty taste, all mixed together.
And Galen recounted the procedure and cure from an ancient physician for treating pain in the groin and sciatic nerve.  He praised it highly, saying that it required no further treatment, and that the patient was healed in a single application, as he described, for the pain was readily relieved by bathing and the ailment was now gone.
And one should take fresh green verdigris, or if that isn't found, fresh fig leaves;  these should be finely chopped with a little bit of pepper and placed on the groin, thigh, or leg where the pain is, and bound in place.
And it should be left on for three hours, or until the patient feels relief from the burning sensation.
And then put him in a bath, and once his body is flushed, let him lie down on the ground, for the pain will cease, and he will be healed.
And understand that one should not use cautery with these remedies except after the body has been evacuated.
But Esculapius says that when a vein constricted by a goat's horn is cauterized, it benefits the patient greatly; and the cautery should be done in this way:  wool should be soaked in old olive oil, and placed between the foot's tendons and the bone.
Then take a dry goat's horn, and heat it in fire until it is charred; and then place it on the wool and let it remain until it has cooled. And repeat this, and do not stop doing this until the sensation of the biting [pain] reaches the bone and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of the veins.
Chapter 42.
Of cauterization for a double pain.
Sometimes pain in the back occurs for various reasons, such as injury or impact, or excessive discharge, and similar causes, due to the infusion of cold and damp matter.
And cauterization is effective only in this particular type, which is caused by the outflow of cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary to evacuate the patient with purging pills and similar remedies, which should be applied to the affected back, three lines long according to its width.  Place a cauterizing agent on each line, perhaps 5 cauteries or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and the efficacy of the agent.
And the cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, using a medial, nail-shaped cautery, following this method:
Chapter 43.
Of cauterization at the beginning of a swelling/tumour.
Often this illness affects young children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it causes difficulty in their movements and also elevates and/or disrupts their movements.
And you find that the last vertebra of the back and the vertebrae of its area begin to project above the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that with a cautery that is circular in shape. that takes the cautery over the entire area of the vertebra.
And if you wish, cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery two or three times. And let the punctures be close together.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered to a swelling caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter XLIV.
Of cauterization for gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which are lodged in each member of the body, then when pain comes to the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And therefore, if gout caused by cold is treated with customary remedies and the pain persists, then cauterize it.
And you cauterize that area near the affected joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be of olive oil, of which this is the form of it:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pain rises into the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries on all sides using this olive oil cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed, then cauterize the area, but do not press too hard with your hand and the cautery beforehand; only slightly around the affected part.
And if the pain goes up to the knee and the thigh, then administer the cautery as described in its chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands, and it is called 'suagra', then puncture in the circuit of the tendons, like a coil, puncturing in those two lines.
And if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture in the tendon circuit around each finger and on the hand's palm.
And if the pain spreads to the thighs or muscles in a few days, then cauterize the affected areas from all sides.
And do not abandon the patient to a good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God helping.
Chapter 45.
Concerning cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines or hernia are protruding through the opening, and this is just beginning, then you must instruct the patient to stop eating on that day and use gentle remedies so that the wound heals from its origin/source within the abdomen.
And then support the patient between your hands on their back, and instruct them to hold still until the hernia or intestines are fully extruded/protruding.
Then, gently return it using your fingers and feel the rupture on the pelvic bone, noting the extremity, which should resemble a half-circle at the upper parts of the body.
And then apply the cautery, whose form is this:
until it is very red and throws sparks. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, and placed a cushion underneath, and another attendant is on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand holding the cautery upright, and hold it until you reach the bone of the tendon within the middle of the duodenum; and repeat it another time if you have not reached the bone in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest it cause death or other great harm to the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not complete.
And the cautery for children should be subtle, according to their size and measure.
And then care for the cauterized area for three days with a bandage until the scab from the fire has healed.
And then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the area and the wound are sealed.
And you must adjust their nourishment according to the length of their treatment, which will line their stomach, and prevent the intestine from being forced out by the effort of healing.
And then, when approximately 40 days have passed, administer a properly made bandage, and let him wear it for another 40 days.
And be careful of work, overeating, drinking, and loud voices, for if he follows this regimen of complete healing, he will be cured.
And I will explain the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the belly, and if, at the beginning, you want them to not break out, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery, proportionate to its size, and make it dry like a third of it; then treat it with what we have said, and it is not adjusted.
And some earlier practitioners might say that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, following this shape, since it is marked with a probe:
And a line is drawn across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a wedge-shaped cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
Of cauterization of twisting.
When pain in certain limbs arises from injury or blows, and that pain persists for a long time and you do not find a cure through medicine, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be of each limb according to its size and smallness, its strength and weakness, and the location of the twisting and pain in it.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is the custom of those pains that they are repeatedly cauterized on the limb that is closest to the affected one, so that one must cauterize repeatedly until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Of the cauterization of leprosy.
Some leprous people receive great benefit from cauterization, and especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, when you wish to cauterize that person, consider if the leprosy is of a kind that can be cured with what we have said in the division, and not otherwise.  If you fear that the corruption has spread throughout the patient's body and entire constitution, then cauterize the affected area on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, a second below that, near the forehead at the edge of the hair; and two more on each side of the head; and one on the back of the head, at the base of the neck, or nape.
And finally, press the cautery into the bone a little until a small indentation is made, and the skin is displaced, so that the expulsion of thick vapors may be relieved; and cauterize over the spleen as needed.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is evident, then you should cauterize it with those cauteries that we described for the head;  and with a cautery on the end of the nose, and two cauteries on both cheeks, and two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and six cauteries on the spinal vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the vertebrae near the hips, one on the hips themselves, and two on the thighs, one on each thigh, and two on the shins, one on each shin, and two on the calves, and two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of each foot; and cauterize it on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of the feet, and on the soles of the hands.
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are above the heel.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the hip bone, and another on the opening of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient feels no pain from the cautery, just as they don't from their cuts, because their body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as previously described by the types of instruments.
And then treat the cauterized area with flour of the earth cooked with honey and the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of cauterization for numbness.
When any limb is numb or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the size of the limb.
And let your cautery enter the skin a little bit. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes numbness is cauterized which affects the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the back and the branches of the nerves which move that limb, and the numbness is removed.
However, do not presume on this unless you are knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves that move the entire body.
Chapter 49.
Of the cauterization of ulcers that are morphea.
When an ulcer is chronic and you do not find any remedy in medicinal ointments, then you cauterize it with a cautery, slightly according to the extent of the ulcer's depth, until the whiteness and discoloration are removed, and its color is changed.
And then treat it with flour of barley and lentils, mixed with rosined oil and arnica leaves, and with a portion of dove's blood or swallow's blood, all mixed together.  Then, a cloth should be moistened and placed on the area until it heals.
Chapter 50.
Of cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference as it is coiled.
And the learned ones say it should be cauterized with the rear cautery in the middle of the area, but I have not seen that, for I am afraid it will become ulcerated, and I have already seen that happen several times.
And it is more appropriate that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circular cautery, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 51.
Of cauterization of malignancies.
When a malignancy is delayed in its maturation, and this is due to the excess that produces it, or due to the patient's age, for they are old and decrepit, with little blood, or due to the passage of time, and you wish to hasten the malignancy's maturation, then cauterize around it with many small, puncturing cauteries.  And then leave it, for this will hasten its maturation.
But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the malignancy until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in a lower location, so that the arm's circulation is eased; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
On the cauterization of a corrosive (or eating) ulcer.
A corrosive is a wandering corruption in the limb, which consumes it as if a fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if that corrosive is in a location suitable for cauterization with fire, then you should apply small, pointed cauteries, or larger ones depending on what is appropriate for the location of the corrosive.
And then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate the entire corruption and no trace of it remains.
Then leave it for three days, and apply dressings of oil mixed with lint over the cauterized areas until all the scabs are removed and all the corruption is gone.
And then treat it with healing ointments that promote flesh growth.
But if after three days, healthy flesh grows in the areas where there was no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas.
And sometimes it is treated with a sharp medicine, for that acts as a substitute for cautery. However, cauterization with fire is a more readily effective cure.
And I have already mentioned the treatment of this with sharp medicine in the division, therefore use that when you need it.
Chapter 53.
Of cauterization of wounds and other similar conditions.
Often in the parts below the affected foot, a disease called a "claw" develops, a serious, painful condition that afflicts the foot; and cauterization in those cases is done in two ways, that is, cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is done by igniting a concave cautery, resembling a small knife, made of iron sized to match the extent of the wound, and with fine, sharp edges.
Then place that heated cautery on the wound, and rotate your hand with the cautery around the wound until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. And leave it there for three days until it begins to discharge pus. And then apply a poultice of crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if this does not work, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you should apply cauterization with water.  Take a cannula of bronze, iron, or a hawk's feather, and place it over the wound; then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula.  Hold your hand steady, and rotate the cannula with your hand all around, pressing the edge of the cannula into the root of the wound.  The hot water will travel to the base of the wound.  Allow the patient to endure the hot water's effect for an hour, and then remove it, for the wound, with its roots, will be eradicated.
And thus do with these and then with the others until all of those [afflicted areas] on their body are treated.
And then treat those pus where the roots of the wounds are eradicated with ointments which generate flesh.
Chapter 44.
Of cauterization for tremors.
When someone has tremors due to cold in the nerves or a cold-causing fever, or another similar cause, then you should cauterize that with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra; and with a cautery on the soles of the feet, and on the stomach with an olive-oil cautery.
And the tremor in him subsides and hastens the recovery from the cold illness.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization for white spots (or lesions) on the body.
When white spots appear on the body, and pustules and sores are formed from corrupted thick matter, then at the beginning, as soon as it appears, it should be cauterized over the entire head of the fistula with a thin cautery made of myrtle wood, whose tip is heated; or with long resinous roots; or with a lens-shaped cautery.
And sometimes, cauterization at the beginning of its expulsion, in this manner, is also beneficial; and it is not believed, and the excess matter is broken down in this manner, and it heals.
However, this should be done near the time of evacuation by bloodletting.
Chapter 56.
Concerning the cauterization of accidental blood flow by archer's incision.
Very often, an arrow's blood flow, which is incised towards the wound that lies outside, or towards the incision of abscesses or cauterization of the limb, and similar instances, are difficult to control.
Therefore, if this happens to someone, then you should apply your hand to the opening of the arrow wound, and place your index finger over it, pressing it several times until the blood flow beneath your finger stops, and it no longer flows out.
Then place the small and large olive-shaped cauteries, many in number, in the fire, and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then take one of those, small or large, according to the location and the wound where the artery is broken, quickly place it over that vein after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is cauterized and stopped.
And if the blood spurts from the artery's opening when you remove your finger and release the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from the ones prepared in the fire, and then continue doing this again and again until the blood flow is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is here, and to cause further harm to the patient.
And understand that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop it, especially if the artery is large, except by one of four methods: either with a cautery as we have said, or by extraction if it is not already extracted, for when it is extracted, the extremities of the patient are burned and the blood is stopped, or by tying it with a thread or bandage with a strong constriction, or by placing medicines, whose virtue is to stop the blood, on top of it; and these are pressed with a cushion with a proper constriction.
However, whoever administers constriction with bandages or by applying burning substances, does not achieve a prompt result.
But if this happens to someone and the physician is not present, nor is there any medicine, then one should, with a gentle pressure of the finger on the opening of the vein, as we have said, and applying a great constriction until the blood is stopped from the source of the wound, and the finger should not be removed from the artery; and over the artery should be sprinkled with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and one should seek more to use cauteries or medicine if needed.
Of incisions, perforations, cupping, phlebotomy, wounds, and similar conditions.
We have already discussed in the first chapter every illness for which cauterization with fire and/or burning medicines is appropriate, along with their causes and occasions, and the necessary instruments and forms of cauteries.  I have organized the chapters from the head to the feet in order of their importance.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker of this information may be aided in whatever they are inquiring about.
And before I begin this, children, understand that this chapter builds upon the first chapter on cauterization.
And therefore, great care is required, for in the operations of this chapter, many times there is evacuation of blood which sustains life, through the lancing of a vein, or incision over an abscess or opening of a fistula or healing of a wound, or removal of an arrow, or incision of a stone and similar procedures. And all of these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in many of them lies death.
And I warn you that this does not fall upon you lightly, for sometimes there are numerous ways of dealing with the many diseases of men. And some of them become enraged by their illness, and death is near to them, and this is due to the severity of their ailment, and the length of their illness, and the illness itself is a fear which signifies death.
And of those is the one who gives you their wealth and says, "you will recover," and their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to that which comes to you in this manner; and your caution should be greater than your greed and your haste; and do not presume any cause upon this without certain knowledge that verifies it to you, and to which a praiseworthy outcome will follow.
Use prognostication and indication of the path to health in the treatment of all your patients, for in this is your aid in acquiring fame and memory, praise and glory.
O, children, may God inspire your understanding and not withhold direction and protection from you, for this is in His power.
And I have arranged this chapter, distinguishing it by sections, following the previous chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that what you seek and need concerning this will be made easier for you.
First Chapter.
Of the treatment of water which is contained within the head of children.
Know that this illness often affects children during or after birth, and when the nurse presses the child's head too tightly.
And sometimes it arises due to hidden causes that are unknown.
However, I have only seen this illness in children, and all those I saw ended up dying, and thus, I have left the treatment of it to others.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always swelling until he could no longer support himself due to the size of his head, and further, that the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture either collects between the skin and the bone, or collects under the bone over the spine.
When the operation is on this area where the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should cut open the middle of the head with a lengthwise incision, and the incision should be about two fingers long until the moisture flows out.  This is the method of treatment for spatum:
And therefore, if the moisture is more extensive and the abscess is larger, then there are two incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, a sign of this is that you see the skull's sutures open on all sides, and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your hand on the inside edges; this is not hidden from you. You should cut open the middle of the head with three incisions in this manner:
And then extract all the moisture from the incision; then compress the incisions with cloths and dressings; then apply wine and oil to it until the fifth day; and then loosen the ligature and treat the wound with bandages and ointments; and bandage the head equally; and have the patient eat dry foods with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And there is another way of incision, considering where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the occipital region, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore, make the incision where the abscess and the fluid collection appear, and do it in the way that seems best to you.
And be careful not to cut the artery, lest blood flow out and the patient die from that blood loss while evacuating the moisture.
Second Chapter.
When there is a persistent cold or inflammation in the eyes or feet, and the usual treatments with medicine are not effective, then the final treatment in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you want to incise those [arteries] where the patient has a swollen head, first rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become apparent, and then wrap the patient's neck with a cloth; and then consider where the vein pulses; and mark the locations of each, which are near the ears, and these [arteries] are hidden, but in some men they are not.
And then press on the artery with a probe, and then incise each with a pointed knife, making an incision that penetrates to the bone, and let this be done according to the breadth of the head.
And if you wish, insert the knife below the artery and sever it at the points above.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers together, for when any vein is incised, the blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which leaps outward in frequent spurts.
But if the artery is not apparent to the touch, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the amount of space of three fingers, and then press with a probe, and penetrate to the bone.
And the amount of blood that needs to be drawn is about one ounce, though more or less is drawn easily, and all of this is according to the apparent strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any cause of inflammation remains on the bone, then excise that so that a suppurating abscess does not develop.
And then press the wound with pledgets and bandages of linen, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When in some cases you encounter chronic headaches or acute fevers, caused by acrid humidities and the quality of the lacerations in the temples, or if a chronic and severe ailment resembling these is present, and it is not relieved by the usual medicinal treatments, we have found, in these illnesses, the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have shown, to be effective.
And the method of the operation and extraction of those arteries is that the patient removes the skin that is in the temples; and locate the artery appearing in the temple, because it is shown to you by its pulse, and is hidden except to a few people due to the intensity of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's neck should be tightened with a cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply warm water until the artery becomes clearly visible to you. And then you take the instrument, of which this is the form: And then you gently scrape the artery with that instrument until you reach the artery; and then carefully remove it from its surrounding tissues until you extract it from the artery and expose the layers beneath it, on all sides.
But if the artery is delicate, then wrap it with the tip of the instrument, and then cut a section from it according to the amount required to extend the ends and constrict them, and no blood flow will result. Because if not cut, blood will not fully ascend.
And then drain the blood by one to three ounces.
And if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with strong double-braided silk or strong cord, and this will prevent putrefaction before the wound heals and prevent blood flow.
And then cut away the excess tissue between the two ligaments; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until the bone is reached, with a sharp cautery until its edges are cut, and it will remain in place of the same operation.
And it is a better course of action if the patient does not have a fever or is not of a hot constitution; for cauterization is from those things that help to eliminate moistures, and therefore is better in convalescence.
And it is necessary after the removal of the arteries that the area be filled with old cotton, and then be placed over it with well-made powders, and then treated with drying medicines that promote flesh growth and with some other remedies until it is healed.
And if, while operating, a flow of blood from the artery occurs again, then you should try to stop the blood, either with a cautery or by filling the area with cotton, and pressing firmly with your hand until the blood is stopped. And if none of those things are available to you, then place your finger over the area until the blood has congealed, and apply water of intense coldness until the activity subsides and it is constricted as needed.
And the easiest way to remove an artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery, having two blades.  Having marked the two spots with a probe, and carefully placing each, very hot, until they reach the bone and divide the vein in two places, so that what is between its extremities is stretched out, since these are not fully consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the sharpness of the two blades be equal. However, if the sharpness is less than that of two blades, it is better, for if it is sharp like two blades it is close to burning each time, and does not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in those places, the heat of the fire is retained there and the flesh is separated easily.
And this method is better than any other method and quicker.
And the space between the two blades should be the width of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the treatment of acute and acrid humors in the body.
When the humors are acrid, and they affect the veins around the head, and you find no medicinal cause for the cure, and sometimes the patient's face reddens and they feel a crawling sensation on their forehead as if ants were crawling, and the eyes are weakened, moist, and the skin is irritated, and the eyelids are inflamed by the acridness of the tears, the ancient physicians in the treatment of such cases used this method, and called this treatment 'spassa'.
And you order the patient to shave the skin on their forehead, and then you make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead, along its length. And if the length of the incision is two fingers wide, the first incision should be precisely positioned along the length of the nose, in the middle of the forehead, the second along the length of the eye sockets a little way from the tear ducts, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to injure the arteries that run on both sides, and keep your hand away from the space between both jaws. And if the space between each incision is the size of three fingers laid end to end.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which to absorb the blood.
And then insert the spatula with two sharp ends, and this is the form of the incision on it: that is from the temple area up to the second incision. Scrape with that all the clot that is between the two incisions, along with the clot that is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove this spatula and insert another instrument, called a scalpel, sharp on one side and blunt on the other, into the first incision again.
And place the sharp edge of that instrument against the flesh adjacent to the clot, and the blunt edge inside the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut with that all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But the incision should be continued to this appearance of the clot, and then do this in the middle fissure until the other fissure.
And since a quantity of blood flows, express the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure lint from old cloth, and place upon those powders mixed with wine, oil, and sour wine, and be wary that it does not become a hot abscess.
And on the third day, loosen the ligament and administer a large infusion of warm or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment mixed with rubbed oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Of the treatment of ulcers by cauterization and of sores descending from parts inside the head.
When a person has sharp and persistent cauterization, and the sores on the patient are small, and their healing is weak, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their skin is damaged, and there is acute pain and subsequent weakening in the area of the head, then know by these symptoms that the materials and cauterization come only from many veins originating from the parts inside.
And the best treatment in these cases is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make a small incision in the middle of the forehead, (starting with a cut from the left temple towards the right temple; and the incision should go down to the bone; and move your hand away from the temple cuts, which are weak toward the chewing area), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, and then fill the two edges of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then apply a poultice made from powders mixed with wine and oil to prevent a hot abscess from forming.
And when you remove this and see that the abscess has lessened, then you must rub the bone until new flesh begins to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen to promote the growth of flesh, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, mixing them, and creating a plaster from this to be applied to these wounds to stimulate the birth of flesh.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of that which afflicts the ears.
Every affliction in the ears belongs to one of four types: either it is a mineral, or something similar to a mineral, such as iron or glass; or it is from a plant, like a thorn or a bean; or it is a flowing substance, such as water, sour wine, and things similar; or some sort of animal.
And therefore, when a stone or a similar substance that does not grow or adhere within the ear enters the ear,  and you expose the ear to the sun, and if you move the stone, then instill into it some violet oil or mustard, and then apply extraction of it, and make it sneeze with some substance, and block the nostrils to support the sneezing event. Then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and gently stretch the ear outward, because often this material is forced out with these methods.
And if it is not expelled, then apply extraction with the instrument called a *gesti epicicarios subtil*, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the *gesti*, good; and if not, then apply extraction with a thin, small spoon (a *onci subtil de pauca duplicacio*).
And if it is not expelled by that, then make a brass cannula and insert the tip of the cannula into the ear opening, and seal around the cannula with softened wax and oil, so that only the cannula is open. And then extract with your breath with strong suction, for often this, with what we have described, works.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a heated iron (or, alternately, a device for holding birds) a small amount, and place it at the end of the wound, and then wrap it with appropriately placed cloth. And then insert that into the ear opening easily, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then you should consider cutting it before it becomes a festering boil or spasm.
And the way to cut it is that you first bleed the patient from the sephasic vein and draw blood according to its virtue, and then make the incision between your hands and turn the ear outwards, and make a small incision in the root of the ear towards its base, at the well-pressed place. And let the incision be in the shape of a crescent until it reaches the stone, and once the stone is found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then close the incision at that moment quickly, and heal it until it is healthy.
And if the cause of the ear affliction is one of the growing and swollen masses, then administer its cure and extraction; but if you do not succeed in that way, then you should take a thin spatum according to this method: and administer with that the excision of that mass which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the ear's vapor, and break it into small pieces, and carefully remove them with tweezers or with a subtle action, or with an incision as we have said, because the extraction is thus eased.
But in the case of water that has entered the ear, the patient should initially use sneezing with care, and fill their ear with some old cloth, and lie on that ear in which the water is, and if by this it is forcibly expelled, it is good; and if not, then take small, smooth stones according to the length of the finger, and heat them slightly in the fire, and the patient should insert one of them into the hole of their ear and place one foot on that side and strike with another stone on the stone that is inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with a stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, do not cease this with a stone until all the water is expelled. And when the water is thus expelled, you should take some paper or cloth, put one end in the ear, and hold the other end with fire until the majority of it is burnt.
And then put in more cloth and do this repeatedly until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula as previously described for the stone extraction method.
However, in the extraction of an animal entering the ear, if it is small, like a worm or something similar, treat it as we have described in the division; but if it is large and causes visible distress, then administer its extraction with tools and forceps, and it is easier to deal with than any other things which enter the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm that has grown in the ear, when you treat it with what we have discussed in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not work, then you should expose the ear to the sun.
And therefore, if any sign of worms appears, then extract it with fine forceps or tweezers; but if no sign appears, then take a cannula, narrow at the bottom and wider at the top, of which this is the shape: And insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; and then suck strongly with it, and do this many times, until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not yield to this treatment, then you should seal and close around the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations that the ancients have used in treating worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your application be with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear with this instrument, of which this is the form: Make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole, and broad at the top.
And therefore, it should be as if pressing into the cavity of the cannula where it is necessary. And if you wish, take a rod and wrap its end neatly in cotton, then pour oil into the cavity of the instrument, or the juice of any herb, or whatever medicine you want, into the cannula—and this is in the ear—then insert the rod with cotton on top and press with your hand gently until the oil is expelled into the cavity of the instrument, and the patient feels the oil inside.
And whatever is to be inserted into the ear should be warmed a little with fire. And be careful that the substance you are distilling into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Of the treatment of ear congestion.
Sometimes children inherit this from their mothers' wombs, and this happens in some men, congestion in the ear canal due to a plague or some flesh growing there; and this congestion sometimes occurs at the opening of the ear canal, preventing discharge, and sometimes it is on the outer parts.
And that which occurs at the opening, preventing discharge, is in the most difficult situations to cure.
And in that which allows discharge, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and observe it. And therefore if congestion appears, open it with a subtle instrument, of which this is its form:
If its extremity, where the width is small, has one sharp side and the other not; and the instrument has two leathers [or straps] so that it does not damage the ear.
And therefore if the congestion is due to flesh grown in the ear or in its canal, then remove it with fine hooks and cut it away with forceful ease until all the flesh is gone.
And if the congestion is in the front of the ear, then take a thin, pointed [or sharp] instrument and heat it a little with fire, and then place it in the ear canal.
And therefore, if you have sensed congestion with which the patient has difficulty hearing, ease the oppression with gentleness; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place a cloth, in proportion to the width of the hole that you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment, in the ear, and do this for a few days until you are certain of the wound's healing, or take some [substance] and pulverize it over it, rubbing it in, and use it. And if the ear has already become suppurated, then you must extract the substance and replace it with another substance wrapped in a plaster made from heated oil, until the abscess subsides; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if blood flows, then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that restrict the flow of blood, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Of the treatment of a swelling that comes to the eyelids.
Swellings that appear on the eyelids of the eyes sometimes are moist, sometimes are dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with forceps or tweezers, and separate them from their roots with a knife, and then apply a compress to the affected areas.
But if pain with blood flow occurs, then cauterize those areas with a small, lens-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return if any root cause remains; and when cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that occurs on the eyelids.
Often on the eyelids there is a cause resembling swelling in its strength and hardness, and therefore it is called swelling.
And it is a collection of thick moisture on the eyelid above and below.
Therefore, the procedure in these cases is to consider whether the swelling is originating from something visible on the eyelid and spread to all parts; and the cause of this is slight.
Therefore, make a cut across it at the width, then gently scrape it from all sides until it gives way, then lift it with forceps and cut it off.
And if the figure is large, then you should stitch it up and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, you will not suffer any harm, as the ointment will restore and close it.
And if the size is receding towards the inside of the eyelid, away from the surface, then open the eyelid, lift the size with forceps, rather than making an incision, and press it from all sides.  If the eyelid is stretched by an incision, this does not harm in any way.
Then, after the incision, wash the wound with saltwater and treat the area with something that closes it until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a swelling on the eyelid above the eye.
A swelling is a sore that forms on the eyelid above the eye, particularly among children, irritating the eyes of those afflicted and causing them trouble in the morning; and they cannot bear the sunlight because of this, as their tears collect there.
And so you often find them lying on their faces at all times, sleeping on their faces; and their eyelids underneath their eyebrows are damp, already covered with inflammation, and an imminent swelling is apparent in the eye; and that when you press the area with your fingers, you feel swelling there.
And a method of treatment is that the patient rests their head on your lap, then place a cloth over them and warm it, and make a circle of the cloth that fits the swelling on all sides, and then place this over the swelling and press with your fingers so that the swelling is contained within the circle, and then open a small hole in the middle of the cloth over the dampness with a slit, and the slit should not be larger than the slit made in a lancing incision.
But in the process, you must cut the skin completely until you reach the swelling, for in most cases, the swelling develops from a white grease-like substance.
Then remove it with cloths that you have wrapped around it with your hands on either side, and roll it between your right and left hands until it disappears.
And be careful not to press too hard on the slit so that with the pressure you do not pierce the swelling and damage it.
But if the swelling does not appear at the beginning of the slit, but you gently press on the slit until swelling occurs; and then remove it as we have said; and then soak cloths in warm water and vinegar and place them over the area and compress them with powders.
And some people sprinkle salt and place it in the cavity of the slit to absorb the remaining moisture.
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs in the area, then treat it with cooling poultices until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Methods of treating the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes, swelling occurs due to inflammation beneath the natural skin and it is prolonged, then that irritates the eye and causes various ailments, like constant tears, softening of the eyelids and surrounding tissue, until it causes damage to the eye, which is called eye inflammation.  It is treated in four ways: either by cauterization with fire; or with a sharp medicine, as previously described in the chapter on cauterization; or inflammation is treated by incision and suturing; or by using tubes (or cannulae), as I will explain.
Therefore, you should place the patient's head on your lap; then, gently hold the eyelid with your left hand, and if it is already open that's fine; but if not, carefully insert a needle into the part where the pus is collected just below the eyelid, and push the needle with pus upwards and outward, close to the edge of the eyelid where the eyelashes begin and close to the eyelashes themselves. Pull the pus upwards along with the eyelid, and hold the eyelid open with your instrument.
Then, in the area beneath the eyelid, along the inflamed skin, make an incision from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct; then remove the pus and place small cotton or linen powders underneath the eyelid.  Then gently cover the eyelid with a bandage, shaped like a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape of the bandage should be adapted to the amount of swelling in the eyelid, as this varies between individuals.  In those cases where significant incision of the eyelid is needed, it should be proportionate to the degree of softening of the eyelid.
Then, using the scalpel, make an incision along the two lines you have marked, beginning at the larger tear duct and extending to the smaller one. And if your incision is close to the natural eyelashes, it should be as wide as the king's thumb.
And then place the forceps on one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape the entire area clean.  Then, use stitches to close the two edges of the wound with fine wool or lint, and wipe away any blood.  If desired, adhere any excess lint to the eyebrows with some adhesive material, but if not, don't worry about it.
And leave the stitches in place for three or four days, and then treat the wound.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches, and treat it with something that dries and constricts it, because the eyelid is raised due to the sealing of the wound and the accumulation there; but stitches are better.  Thus say the ancients of yore.
But nonetheless, be diligent in your care of the patient, and it is a good action; and there should be no fear involved.
And there is another method in treating this, which is to shape the eyelid like a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid using three forceps, joined and positioned in this way:
But if that is not possible, holding the forceps, and this is not appropriate, then take a needle with thread and place it in the middle of the shape, and insert the other stitch near the larger tear duct, and the second stitch near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the stitches evenly between your fingers.  Then, with a firm lift, raise the entire flap that is shaped as we have described.
And then close the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess develops near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with poultices and similar remedies, and with ointments.
And sometimes, the eyelashes might need to be trimmed. In that case, use what we have said about incisions; however, a stitch in each is more artful/delicate.
To treat with canes is according to this form: and it is that you turn the eyelid and cut the figure within according to what I have recounted; and then, artfully make two thin canes or sticks, whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid and whose width should be smaller than the width of the space. And you have already incised at the extremities of each part, where you have the threads/stitches.
Then carefully add each one to the superfluous part of the eyelid, and tightly bind the canes to each part, and leave it for a few days, because the flesh will die and be denied and rot until it falls off by itself.
But if it has lingered, then break it with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Therefore, when it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the method for two canes which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of the length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of the lifting of pricking hairs in the boil with a needle when the hair is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough, and prickling hairs in the boils, then the operation on them is that you take a fine needle and place it in that delicate strip of silk and linen, and then that you carefully adjust the ends of it, twisting each in a very delicate way. And the length of the strips of thread should be about the length of a palm.
And then you place another fine thread beneath it briefly, and tie the ends of that one if you wish.
And then place the patient's head on your lap, and let it be near the sun so that your work is clearly visible, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then introduce the needle into the root of the adjusted hair, which needs skill, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull that hair out above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair out above it and put it in a small container, and let the hairs be one or two or three, and no more.
And then remove your hand with it until the hair is pushed out, along with the small container, from the eyelid, away from the natural hair.
But if the small container is pulled out and the hair is not expelled, you will pull the container in small parts downwards with the ointment which you have prepared with that, until the small container is ejected from the hole above.
And remove it from the eye's sight, for then you will throw away the container and the ointment, and everyone washes and closes the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you attach a long hair from the natural ones, and lift with that, or let it until it is stretched to some distance, and then you lift it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of an abrasion which appears on the eyelid above.
When an abrasion occurs in the eye, and the eyelid is contracted above, either on the right or left side, due to poor healing from a wound, incision, or cautery, and it is called leporine, and this abrasion is either natural or accidental, and is caused by the poor healing of wounds, incisions, or cauteries, or by similar poorly healed wounds.
The method of treatment for it is to break apart that scar tissue and separate the edges, and place a piece of linen cloth between them, and tie them together until they are healed.
And you should not use treatments that dry or constrict it; for if you do, the abrasion will return worse than it ever was before.
Use remedies that soften it, such as fenugreek, and apply it with water in which marshmallow and flax seeds are soaked, or diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil.  Soak a cloth in this mixture and use it for treatment.
And the key to your treatment is to break open any unhealed area according to the original form of the wound.
And this procedure, which we have described, is merely a correction of the abrasion, returning the area to its previous form.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of an abrasion on the lower eyelid.
This abrasion on the lower eyelid, properly called an abrasion, can be either a natural or an accidental injury.
But an accidental abrasion is caused by a blow, or a cut, or a cautery, or other similar injuries.
And the method of treating it is that you take a needle with a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and have it pass from the left lacrimal duct to the right lacrimal duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then spread the flesh apart with the needle and stitch it with the needle, and cut with a broad spatula. And thus, if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, it is good; and if not, take a spatula and place it in the split opening, and with it bring the eyelid back together, and close the two fissures in the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two fissures be two angles of the incision you have made until they meet, and let their junction be an angle, so that when they come together, their shape is formed.
And this shape is the Greek letter: lambda.
And then remove the flesh from that area, the amount that is the sharp edge beneath the eyelid.
And then bring the separated parts together and sew them with wool thread; and then treat them with the softening medicines and poultices we mentioned until healed.
And if a laceration is to be treated by fissure, suture, or cautery, then you should make a flat fissure on the eyelid skin as previously described. And then separate with a poultice between the two lips, as we have described.
In the summary of the treatment of lacerations, whether above or below, let the operation proceed according to the preparation of the laceration, and this is in various forms.
And the skilled craftsman always prepares instruments in every possible way until the shape returns to the natural form, or nearly so, and the patient according to what is appropriate for the operation and the instruments in the best arrangements.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in many such cases where the eyelid is adhered to the white of the eye, and is prevented from its natural movement and functions, then you must insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid, and lift or extend it with a forceps.
And then you carefully incise the adhesion with a blunt instrument, avoiding sharp incisions so that the patient is not disturbed by the procedure, and leave the instrument so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should carefully sever the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and all the adhesion is removed.
And then you place saline water in the eye with which you wash it; or you distill rosewater dissolved in the water.
And then you separate the eyelid and the eye with a cloth, and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white, and then on the third day use healing substances until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning incisions of the nail and protruding flesh of the lacrimals.
Know that a nail is of two types, either it is nervous, and is like a hard, fine, pointed thing; or it is non-nervous, resembling frozen white moisture, which, when touched with an iron, or if forced to be taken with a forceps, it is cut off and the forceps are not stuck in it.
And both types (of nail) begin only from the larger lacrimal, gradually spreading to cover the eye and obstruct the light and movement of the eye.
But the method of operating on it (the nail) is that the patient should rest their head on your shoulder, then open their eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with forceps of little curvature and gently pull it away from the surrounding area. Then take a needle and thread it with horse, ox, or cow hair, or similar strong thread, or twist the tip of the needle a little and place it in the middle of the nail, then pierce it with the needle and tie the nail with the thread; and gently pull it away from the surrounding area, and peel away the layer of nail that covers the pupil. And thus you secure it (the nail) with the thread all the way back.
Then you cut the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal gland with a thin blade or small scissors, leaving the natural tissue of the lacrimal gland intact, so that cutting it doesn't cause a continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail, using only forceps or thread, as we have said, and then scraped with a lion's-claw-shaped scraper (the instrument), which has this form:
And be careful that with the scraper you do not touch the cornea and cause a rupture, and that the pupil is pierced.
Then place a little bit of crushed salt or cinnabar on the incision, and leave it there until the next day; then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle, or if it is not embedded in the nail bed, then often this type of nail is treated with medicines and is healed as I have described in the section.
And if you want to incise it, then you open the wound of the patient and take a sharp, slender lion's-claw scraper of this shape: with subtlety. And if sometimes it is dilated and has spread to the surrounding tissue, then instill from your vial into the wound a bit of cinnabar or red ochre or crushed salt, and cover the wound until the next day.
And then repeat the procedure until all that is there is removed, unless a hot abscess forms in the wound, for then you leave that and first treat the abscess until it is healed.
And then repeat your procedure on it with reason until it is healed.
If a swelling of the tear-duct flesh is seen in the wound, causing great harm, it should be suspended with a bandage; and you should cut it back in one part, but do not extend the incision so as not to cause a flow of tears.
And then instill into the tear duct red ochre and cinnabar until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the incision of a boil and what arises from hardened flesh in the wound.
Sometimes in the wounds of some people red flesh grows, and it overgrows until it covers the pupil, or it approaches or tightens on the eyelids, and forcefully presses the eyelids inwards and outwards, and is shaped like the teeth of a battlement.
But the operation on him is that the patient rests their head on your lap; then open the wounds of that area and collect all that flesh with appropriate forceps or tweezers, hold it with a forceps or tongs; then slice the flesh in a continuous motion until it is finished with the scalpel, and be careful not to damage the wound during your operation.
And your incision should be done with the same instrument as used in cutting the nail, or with small scissors, with which the tissue is removed, according to the form described earlier in this chapter.
So, once your incision is complete and all the flesh has been removed, then fill the wound with crushed salt, or apply red powder similar to corrosive medicines, and place a cloth with egg white over the wound until it is securely protected from a festering inflammation.
And if some lingering cause of inflammation remains and a hot, painful swelling is feared, then leave the wound and treat that inflammation with whatever resolves that swelling, and subsequently repeat the operation until it heals.  Do the same for any inflamed flesh that occurs in the wound of this type.
However, you should avoid all treatment of the wound through natural or accidental means involving iron, and do not place your hand on any of these operations until you see that the limb is enduring the operation.
Chapter 18.
Of the collection of pus from the wound.
Pus comes out of the inflamed areas that are swollen above the wound, and forbids treatment to its exterior, and the wound should be treated with extended days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider whether the wound containing pus is strong and has no other illness except pus, then you collect that pus.
And you instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and then restrain those swollen areas with an ounce or two, according to your discretion; and that ounce should be of a subtle, double-layered form, according to this method:
or two ounces gradually in one piece, according to this shape:
And then gather those swollen areas with subtle force, subtly, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those swollen areas have receded from the wound and are shrunk.
And be careful not to injure the wound with the edges of the spatula; and if your operation is in the midday sun, be very firm in your operation so that you only cut/incise the swollen areas.
And when you have finished, then you distil green or red juice into the wound so that its sharpness corrodes whatever has receded from the area.
But if this is not possible for you to accomplish at that time, then you apply a poultice to the whole area with whatever alleviates the pain, and leave it for several days until the pain has subsided and a suppurating boil is assured.
And then repeat this according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the method of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Of the reduction of a nasal injury.
When you treat a nasal injury with a cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, according to the narrative that preceded it, and it is not healed, then it is not enough to treat the affected area.  Instead, you should cut open the abscess at the time of its maturation, remove all moisture and pus, until the bone is exposed.
And therefore, when the bone is exposed and there is corruption or blackness in the area, then you scrape it with a tool of which this is the shape:
And it is called a "sharp head," and it is made of iron, and its head is round, like a chisel, which is made pointed by filing or sharpening with a fine file (like the following illustration/diagram).
And place that on the corrupted part of the bone, then gently rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And do this several times, then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated, and good flesh has grown there, and the body's discharge of pus has ceased and remains for 40 days, and it is not renewed and not suppurating and no accidents occur there, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then it is not a case for a remedy but for reducing the fracture to the shape of the nose, and according to this method:  and it is that you expose the second bone with iron or with a sharp medicine, and once you have exposed the bone, then you take a splint according to this form:
Let the end of the iron be triangular, and the shaft of it be thin and tapered towards the end, like this.
Then place that [the splint] over the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal [bone]; and move your hand a little from the hole, and then move your hand with the splint until it penetrates the entire bone, and the patient will feel air escaping as you move their hand.
Therefore, then restore the area with astringent, drying medicines, as I have taught you.
Thus, when the flesh heals and the area is hardened, the material that spread outwards returns to the nose, which is then easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the prominence of the hole/opening.
When the swelling/bulge emerges completely and you do not encounter any harmful or diminishing effects during the appearance, then you must let the patient rest, and then follow it, and then apply leeches to the neck without incisions and apply suction well; and then apply a liniment made of castor, aloe, and incense and sarcocolla to the swelling, and then press the plaster over the swelling with powdered materials.
And the method for the powders is to take fine linen cloths, and each cloth should be doubled into four folds; and make many of these.
And then place those cloths one over the other according to the quantity the swelling needs. And then press upon those with a hard cloth with strong pressure; and repeat the leeches with suction without incisions; and then remove the leeches and leave the swelling pressed tight day and night.
But if meanwhile the swelling is softened, then it must be pressed very tightly.
And then maintain the pressure on the swelling throughout the day and night, as we have said.
And if the swelling has already been reduced, it is good, and if not, then repeat the poultice with the powders, and the pressure, and the leeches until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the uvea tunic.
When there is a protrusion in the uvea tunic, and it has become prominent and protrudes from the eyelids like a cluster of grapes, and the shape of the eye is distorted because of it, and you want to incise it, then the operation there is as we have described, that you insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, and then insert another needle with a double thread from the tear duct side, and have that one penetrate and leave the first needle in its position; and then you cut the area with the double thread and pull out the portion of the uvea in the circumference of the needle, and firmly grasp that part.
And then remove the needle and place a wool soaked in egg white over the swelling, and leave it until the thread comes out with the grape-like protrusion.
And then treat the swelling with this, which will strengthen it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes, to gather all parts with a cloth circle around the large swelling, then pierce it with a thin spatula that reaches the base of the swelling, and the white fluid will drain, and the swelling will subside and disappear quickly.
And then press until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of gout.
This ailment, called gout, is nothing but a fluid that has gathered in a swelling, like descending water, but is not that.
But the method of treatment is to have the patient sit on a prepared and upright chair, and then take their head in your hands in two places and gently hold it until you see the fluid emerging to the lower parts, and then let it dry and not descend, and block the light, and let the patient see the causes as they would see them.
And if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the fluid is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a fine, dry cloth and apply it to the inflamed area slightly inside the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the corner (into the empty area) until the fluid is expelled.
Then, once it is expelled, you instill warm water into the swelling, in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then treat with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of water descending from the eye.
We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and which are suitable for puncturing with a pointed instrument, then act according to the patient's health.
Then you should place the patient between your hands on a bed, and tightly bind their eye.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their eye, if the eye in which the water is located is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right eye.
And then with your right hand, take an almond, if the eye is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right eye.
And then place the tip of the almond near the edge, according to the thickness of the ray, on the white part of the eye, near the smaller tear duct, and then press on the almond with force and rotate your hand with it.
And then press into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has now reached the empty space.
And it should be the length of the almond's path to the target, the same length as the space between the pupil and the edge of the dark area, which is the edge of the eye; for you will see through that pupil with the eye's vision due to the clarity of the cornea.
And then place the almond into the location where the fluid is, and then pull it down a few times, and if the fluid descends immediately, then you will see the patient look at the area of fluid immediately, and the almond in their eye.
And then rest a little; if the fluid has descended, then you rest again before the almond is thrown.
And thus, when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond with ease, and gently move your hand around it, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt into the fluid, and with that, wash the inside of the eye; and then apply to the outside of the eye lint or a cloth or wool soaked in rubbed oil and egg white, and bandage the eye.
But we, and those of our time, put a crushed compress with egg white on that.
And if your almond does not penetrate the eye due to its hardness — for some men's eyes are very hard — then you should take the substance called "alberid," of which this is the form:
And thus pierce that conjunctiva with it, and do not press your hand into the hole, and only make a subtle path for the almond.
And then introduce the almond as we have said.
And after completing your work, the patient should be prepared for sleep in a properly made bed, where he sleeps on his back in a dark room, and all movement is forbidden.
And place this upon him so that his nature is calmed, and do not move his head to either the right or left side at all.
And let the bandage remain according to its application until the third day.
And then remove it from that dark room, and prevent him from seeing anything, and show him some things, and then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And you should not do this during the hours of treatment or immediately after the infusion. It is necessary that you remove this, because the water can easily flow with great and forceful effort.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to remove the dressing before the seventh day, and treat it with something that will cause the abscess to subside.
Then you remove his sight and place something over his face for him to be watched over by someone beneath him for several days, him being in the dark room.
And then gradually remove him from that room and return him to his normal activities.
And know that in this situation, the student is not excused from observing several times, and then you should be bold in your operation.
And it has been reported to us by some of those who are at Artach, and some said that a fire was made in the Ayrac, perhaps to penetrate and thus drain the water.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read of it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that this is something new.
And these are the forms of the types of "magdaan" (likely a type of medicine or remedy) so that those who are ignorant of them may learn about them:
And they should be made of iron or, properly, of lead, and their extremities should be shaped with this triangular subtlety, the sharp end similar to the shape.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
When various fleshy growths appear in the nose, some of which are caused by something resembling a very heavy scorpion or a fish-like polyp; and this illness is called polyps because it resembles that described fish. And from it grows cancerous, ulcerated flesh, dark in color; and from it is also leonine flesh, not dark in color.
Therefore, in those fleshy growths that are not fraudulent or cancerous, you should place the patient between your hands, expose them to the sun, and clear their nostrils, and prick those growths with your lancet. Then extract that to the exterior, and then cut what you have grasped of those growths with a sharp, thin spatula, until you know that all the flesh is removed; for if any part remains from which the excision is possible, then you scrape it with one of the sharp instruments with ease until no part remains. But if it swells with blood or forms a hot abscess, then you apply what is appropriate; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you cauterize and cut it until the blood is drained and all the cavities are removed.
And then put vinegar and water or wine into the nose near the incision. But if the nose is open and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is already healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside it is flesh or pus adhering to the excess bones of the nose to which the excision has not reached.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a piece of lint to which some thickness is given, and use many pieces, and place the amount of a finger or less between each piece.  Then bind the patient and insert one end of the lint into the nose with a stick or other appropriate implement.
And after this has been done, draw the lint in until it reaches the channels of the nose, and it comes out over their throat, because many times children in schools do something similar to this action, and it's an easy thing to do for anyone who wants to.
Then hold the two ends of the lint, one end coming out from the nose and the other remaining in the nose.  Then apply a rasp (or scraping tool) to the flesh around the lint, doing so until you are certain that the flesh is adhering to the lint.
Then remove the lint, and place a poultice over the nasal area, in the immediate vicinity of the wound, and do this for three days or more until the poultice has completely consumed all remaining flesh.
And finally, place a lead cannula in the nose for several days until it is healed.
But if you need a more thorough treatment, use this one.
And this is the form of the instrument for nasal purging, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And make this of silver or brass, which is similar to a small, open lamp or a small shell, and the spout is similarly shaped.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula, like a tube, and the cannula of the nasal purging instrument should be flat, open; to which there should be a handle at the back of it, with which you hold it when heating the oil or other liquid substances you want to use in it.
Chapter 25.
Of the ointments for the nasal extremities.
Often ointment is applied to the nasal extremities, and it is increased and augmented over several days until it becomes very obvious.
And therefore, you should cut it at the beginning of its appearance, and remove all of it. And then place a cautery or a burning medicine in its place.
However, if its incision is delayed until it has grown large, then consider if it is hardened, hard, dark colored, and with little feeling.  If so, do not touch it with iron, for it is a deep-seated abscess; for often the one who incises such an abscess brings great harm upon the one it was affecting.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch and not dark-colored, and if incision is possible throughout it, then drain the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the area with whatever dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when the continuity is broken by plague or similar causes.
Know that when you encounter a break in continuity in one of these cartilages, you achieve little in that operation except for some men (or: in some cases).
Therefore, when you encounter any of those causes, consider if it is fresh plague with its blood, and if so, you should bring together the two sides of the wound with sutures, then treat it until healed.
And if the edges of the broken skin are already separated and each is healthy, then you must scrape each side of their edges until blood comes out. Then bring together the two edges with sutures, and tighten them.  Powder the area with dragon's blood and crushed herbs, and place a piece of diachronic plaster, or another type of consolidative plaster, over the powder.  Leave it bound for two or three days, then remove it and change the plaster, and leave it until the pus is separated, then treat with ointment until healed.
The method of suturing is that you either join the broken skin with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the belly, or you join the broken skin with glue, as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things that are found in the two edges of the internal parts.
Often, hard abscesses resembling grains of millet form on the inner parts of the lips in men, and some are smaller, some larger.
Therefore, you must turn the lips inside out and remove each of those hardnesses completely, and then, after the excision, fill the place with some crushed sage until the bleeding is stopped, and then wash the area with sour wine, and treat the place with a styptic until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of the flesh adhering to the gums.
Often, flesh adhering to the gums, which the ancients called "albulus," forms.  In that case, you should detach it with forceps or scissors, and sever it at its base, allowing the discharge (pus or blood) to drain.
And then apply crushed sage or other styptic or astringent powders to the area.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it again and cauterize it, for the cautery will prevent it from returning.
Chapter 29.
Of tooth extraction with an iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both on the inner and outer parts and between the gums, rough, hard, and sometimes black, yellowish, or greenish scabs form, causing a corruption of the gum and making the teeth brittle.
And therefore, you should place the patient between your hands, rest their head on your knee, and scrape the teeth where these scabs and similar, gritty substances appear until no trace of them remains, thereby removing the blackness, yellowness, and other such impurities.
Therefore, if you have removed what was present at the beginning of the procedure, it is good; but if not, then you repeat the procedure the next day, and the day after that, and again on the third day until the condition reaches the desired state.
And know that teeth require many different types of rasps and shapes, depending on the preparation for your operation. And therefore, the rasp used to scrape the inner side of the tooth is different from the rasp used to scrape between the teeth, according to other shapes, and these rasp shapes must be prepared by you; you will see them shortly.
Chapter 30.
Of the eradication of teeth.
You must treat the tooth's pain with all possible means and be slow in any tooth extraction, for there is no cause that compensates for the tooth's being removed, for it is a subtle substance until it is removed from the extraction.
However, when the patient insists on extracting the tooth, you must be absolutely certain which tooth is diseased, for many times the pain deceives the patient and seems to be in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, and the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operation of barbers.
Therefore, how should you be certain which tooth is diseased, and that you know it well?  Then you should scarify the area around the tooth with a substance possessing some virtue, until the tooth and the gum are separated on all sides, and then work at it with your tools, or with small, sharp forceps, bit by bit, until it yields.
And then, use strong pliers for a good grip or leverage, and place the patient's head between your knees to hold it firmly so it doesn't move.  Then pull the tooth straight, in a manner that does not break it, nor cause the patient excessive pain.
And if it is not fully removed, then take one of those instruments and place it beneath it from all sides with ease, and try to remove it gently as it was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you should cover that hole with cloth and compress it with a fine, thin instrument so that it does not crack during the time you are using the pliers to extract it.
And you should carefully open the gum surrounding the tooth with incisions on all sides, and be very careful to not break it and leave a portion of it remaining, and return to the patient with the malice that the new pain is greater than the first.
Beware that you do not do as some ignorant barbers do in their rashness and audacity regarding tooth extraction, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great illnesses in people that are more difficult to cure than the original problems, and the roots of the teeth remain, some or all, or they extract them with some of the jawbone, as we have often testified.
And after the extraction, rinse the mouth with warm wine or vinegar with salt.
And if bleeding occurs afterward, as often happens, then apply a small quantity of alum and sprinkle it on the wound; and if that alum doesn't help, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and delicate pliers with which the tooth is initially grasped should be long at the extremity, with a short, thick handle, so they do not bend when working with them.
And they should be like those with thick handles, so that when you squeeze with them, they don't bend; and have short extremities.
And they should be made of Indian iron, well-made with straight extremities, and on the ends of those are teeth that interlock and grip with a strong constriction.  Sometimes the extremities of those are shaped like the beak of a stork, or a kind of hooked shape, and they are strongly constricting.
Chapter 31.
Of the removal of teeth and the extraction of bones from fractured jaws.
When the removal of a fractured tooth requires further action, you should apply a poultice with wool for a day or two, until the area is softened; then, insert forceps, the ends of which are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork or a guanta (a type of hook), in the form of pliers:
The ends of them should be filed or shaped like a rasp.
And if you do not succeed with these forceps or pliers, then you must carefully dig around the root and expose all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small lever, which has this shape:
And it should have a short, thick end, a little bit, so that it is not broken.
Therefore, if the root is thus dislodged, good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the shapes: the shape of the first instrument is triangular, with some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and have a more delicate tip.
And having been helped with this instrument, with two ramps, of which this is the approximate shape: and with other instruments that I will describe in the treatment of teeth; for good is done with this instrument, which is like a large crescent, and this is the shape:
of a triangular, curved or short tip, which has some thickness, and is not blunt so that it is not chipped.
And also know that the instruments for the teeth are similar to other instruments.
But the skillful and subtle craftsman in the art, himself finds according to what the operation and the various illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not give nor devised a proper instrument, because of the forms of different species.
But if the bone of the jaw or other bones of the mouth are fractured, or broken, then let a pressure be applied to it in its place with what is suitable to it of the instruments and forceps that we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help yourself with a gesture whose form is this:
And let there be some small pressure gradually, and let it be constricted or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or leak until the bone is completely set; and then restore the area with suitable medicines for that.
But if there is a small swelling on the bone, then remove that swelling and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth protruding above the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural position due to irregular growth, especially in women, and particularly in the most venerable young women;  therefore you must consider: if the tooth is close to another tooth, and separation or trimming is not possible, then extract it; but if it is not connected to another tooth, then cut it away with this instrument, which has the shape of a pig's snout, and is made of Indian iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision, with which you cut it, be gradual over several days, due to the tooth's hardness, so that it does not damage the other teeth.
And if the protruding tooth is suitable for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file, of which this is the shape:
And let it be entirely of Indian iron, easily sharpened; and let it have very small points, just like the file with which needles are made, with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. And then trim it at the end, and extract the root with some razors.
And if a part of the tooth is fractured and injures the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of the fracture is removed and smoothed, and is made even so that the tongue is not injured nor the speech corrupted.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of broken teeth with gold or silver filings.
When, due to blows to the front teeth, there is a concussion and displacement through impact or forceful striking, and the patient cannot hold onto what is missing, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, but your treatment has been unsuccessful, then, to avoid decay, it is better to use gold filings to strengthen the parts, and not silver; for silver turns green and can quickly rot after a few days, whereas gold does not change in any way.
And the filings should be so fine and granular, according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the method of application is to take the filings and place double the amount between two healthy teeth, and then, using two twists of the filings, fill between the broken teeth, whether one or several, until it reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then gently, repeatedly press it back to the starting point, holding it firmly and skillfully until it is no longer broken.
And your grip should be strong enough to hold the filings against the tooth roots, so they don't fall out.
And then, using forceps or scissors, cut off any excess filings, and carefully place them in each gap, shaping and hiding them between the healthy tooth and the broken tooth, so as not to injure the tongue. And then leave it like that, firmly in place.
But if it is loose or broken, hold it or them with another filing in such a way, all the time.
And this is the method for teeth and the technique of joining two healthy teeth and two broken ones, as seen in these examples:
And when one or two teeth are repositioned into their sockets, and are reattached as we have described, and remain in place.
And only skillful and knowledgeable artisans can do this.
And sometimes a piece of cow bone is shaped like a tooth and placed in the gap where the tooth is missing, and is secured as we have described, and remains and serves in that place for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the inflammation of the ligament that affects the tongue and inhibits speech.
This ligament, which sometimes lies beneath the tongue, is either natural, present from birth, or accidental, caused by a wound that has already healed.
And the operation on it involves opening the patient's mouth, their head being held by you; lifting their tongue, and then cutting that nervous ligament along its width until the tongue is freed from its constriction.
But if there is any hardness or knotting there, and this is due to the healing of a wound, then you use forceps and cut it along its width until you have severed the ligament and the knot has been dissolved.
And be careful not to create a tear in the underlying flesh, so that you don't accidentally cut a blood vessel and cause a flow of blood.
And then wash the area of the incision with water or with vinegar or with cold water; then place a linen pad underneath the tongue; this is a device that the patient will keep under their tongue every night to prevent it from adhering again.
But if a flow of blood occurs, apply powdered vitriol to the area; however, if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a smooth cautery iron suitable for this purpose. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of the extraction of a ranula under the tongue.
Sometimes, an abscess resembling a small tumor forms under the tongue, hindering the tongue's natural function; and it grows significantly until it fills the mouth.
And the procedure involves opening the patient's mouth, sitting them facing the sun, and examining the abscess.
And if you see it is dark colored or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it has a whitish hue, indicating moisture, then you place a lancet on it and cut it with a very thin scalpel, and sever it completely.  If blood flows during your procedure, then place a crushed piece of egg white, or vitriol, on it until the bleeding stops.
Then return to your work until you have thoroughly cleaned it, washing it with sour wine and salt.  And treat it with the other appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter 36.
Of the extraction of abscesses from both ears, and those found on the neck, and other abscesses.
When there is an abscess on the neck, these are glands which are connected together (likely swollen).  They protrude outwards and are called "two ears." If you treat them with what we have previously discussed and they do not heal, then consider whether the abscess is hard, dark-colored, and with little sensitivity.  In such a case, do not touch it with an iron (instrument).
And if it is reddish in color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with an iron for the flow of blood.  Rather, allow it to mature, and then either you will drain it or it will break open on its own.
And if it is white in color, soft, and its root is subtle, then it is necessary to make an incision.
And the operation on it is that you should consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already rested,  being fully calmed or if it has lessened somewhat; and then make the patient sit facing the sun, and the patient's head should be in your direction, and open the patient's mouth, and the attendant should hold the patient's tongue down with a very delicate instrument, the shape of which is as follows:
And it should be made of silver or bronze, and be thin like a knife.
So, as you press with it on the tongue and the abscess is shown to you, and you focus on it with your vision, then take a lancet and place it into the opening, and pull it towards the edges as much as you can. After that, if you pull out any part of the tissues, then cut it with an instrument of this shape:
After that, if you pull out any part of the tissues, then cut it with an instrument of this shape: and it resembles forceps, but the ends are curved, so that the opening of each one is in line with the other, very sharp, which should be made of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then cut it with a scalpel of this shape:  And it should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you have incised one wound, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, the patient will recover from cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, then treat it with water decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves, or similar things that have styptic properties, until the flow of blood is reduced, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear around the throat or near those two ears, and cut them as I have described in the incision of two wounds previously.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat. This abscess was dark coloured, with little sensitivity. It had almost completely closed off her throat, and she was breathing with great difficulty.  Eating and drinking water had already been forbidden, and she would have died within a day or two.
And the abscess had grown so large that it had formed two bumps before bursting through two openings.
So I treated it surgically, inserting a lancet into one of the openings, and removed a large portion of it.  Then, I incised the area surrounding the other opening, and opened the patient's mouth, pushing down their tongue, and inserted the lancet into that abscess.
And I then excised a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore, the woman's throat was completely cleared, and she immediately started drinking water and then eating solid food. I continued to lance that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess formed in its place, which I also lanced until it was resolved.
So I cauterized and treated the wound in her throat,  thus adding to the cure; and then I wandered, not knowing what God would do to me in the aftermath.
Chapter 37.
Of the lancing of a boil when it is suppurated.
When a sore develops on the uvula, and it is suppurated and long, it is then called a "perpendicular" sore; and if it is in the lower part, thick and round, then it is called a boil.
But when it is treated with what we have described in the division, and you do not see improvement, and sometimes a suppurated boil has already burst and is small, then you should incise that part which is thick and round; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, of dark colour or black, and is not tender to the touch, then you should try to incise it, for there is danger to the patient in that case.
And when you see it according to the way I have described, by its whiteness and length, have the patient sit down, and press the tongue with an instrument that has the proper shape, and then place the lancet on the new sore, and pull it down and incise it with one of the two instruments, which are described in the lancing of abscesses.
And you should only incise what is appropriately located on the natural boundary without adding anything, for if you incise it further, you will harm the patient's speech.
And after the incision, use the method we described for lancing abscesses, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the patient is frightened by the incision, you should use cauterization without fear, and the method of cauterization is only with sharp water.  You should place the patient's head on your lap, then press their tongue with the instrument we mentioned, and then take the water described in the chapter on cauterization, and cauterize the affected area using it.  Place it neither thick nor thin, and fill the cavity of the instrument, which is of this form:
Let the end of the cavity where the medicine is placed be similar to the cavity of a spoon's bowl, and place the instrument with the medicine on the ulcer.  The patient should lie on their side so that any saliva or mucus from the mouth flows away from the medicine, so that no material from the medicine goes down the throat and irritates it.
Then apply your hand with the medicine, and press it onto the uvula for half an hour, until you see that it has been blackened and quieted by the medicine's action.
And if you wish, take a piece of cloth and wrap it around the end of the probe, and immerse the cloth in the medicine.  Insert the probe with the cloth in a tube until the cloth adheres to the tube, and do this multiple times until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula.  Then leave it there for it to dry and fall off in approximately three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the application of the medicine, repeat it. Then, after cauterization, cleanse the area around the uvula with cloth soaked in broth, and remove any remaining medicine from the surrounding area.  Wash it with cold water, and treat it externally with an application, and internally with remedies, until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incisions and less fearsome in its outcome.
Sometimes the uvula is treated with something less harsh than cauterization or incisions, through fumigation in this way: take balm, hyssop, rue, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile, borage and similar herbs, and combine all or some of these in a pot, and simmer them in sour wine; and the pot should be tightly sealed with appropriate clay, and a small hole should be placed in the middle of the pot, over which a concave bronze instrument should be placed, constructed of silver or bronze.
And the end of the instrument should be inserted into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is significantly dimmed.
And then repeat this many times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess, for it would spread to the abscess, and you should not do this without a doctor's declaration of a hot abscess.
But if this instrument is not available, then take a reed and place a hard-boiled egg shell on its end, so that the patient's mouth is covered, for the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the extraction of thorns and what adheres to the throat and other things.
Many times thorns or fish bones or some other thing adhere to the throat.
Then you must extract what is apparent, on which you focus your gaze, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in front of the sun, so that what is in the throat becomes clear to you.
And what is hidden and unseen in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for the cause adhering to the throat will be easily expelled by vomiting; or the patient should swallow a piece of bread or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or let the patient take a piece of dry sea sponge, and bind it firmly with thread; and then as the patient swallows it, if it reaches the spot where the thorns are, it will be expelled. Or take an eel and swallow it, tied with thread, and it will be put inside and suddenly drawn out; or take a leek and quickly place and quickly draw it in.
But if it is not expelled by those methods we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this way:
And it should be larger than a fingernail, and at its end should be a cavity which you can easily insert into their throat.
And have the patient lift their head, and be careful not to touch their throat bone, so that it does not hurt them, and with that you push the bone or thorn, or the doctor does this with their hand.
But rather that the patient himself inserts it, through his knowledge of the location of the cause, and pushes it down, and pulls their hand with the instrument up, all according to the quantity which is prepared for him until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
Of the extraction of bloodsuckers attached to the throat.
When the bloodsucker is medicated with what we have described in the section on treating with medicines and not with cauterization, then carefully consider the bloodsucker in the patient's throat, facing the sun, after you have compressed the patient's tongue with the instrument we have previously described.
Therefore, if you see the bloodsucker, extract it with a small knife or with skillful, gentle movements.
And if it is not possible for you to remove it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this repeatedly (until the bloodsucker is dead and is detached from the throat) and keep the patient abstaining from water all day.
And then, take a bowl full of cold water, and open the patient's mouth and rinse the mouth with it; and let him not swallow anything and maintain the water in the mouth for about an hour using his hand, because the bloodsucker immediately withdraws when it feels the water.
But if it is not expelled by the methods we have described, then fumigate the patient with incense or with asafoetida using the instrument we previously described for fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it falls off.
And there is another method of fumigation for this: take a bowl containing burning coals, cover the bowl with a lid having a hole in it, and place the tip of the instrument in that hole.  Then perform the fumigation over this, and place the patient's mouth over the tip of the cannula, and have him close his mouth so the fumigation doesn't escape until you know the fumigation has reached the bloodsucker, for the bloodsucker will then fall off immediately.
And if it doesn't fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and keep the patient from drinking, and let him eat salty foods and herbs, and do not let him drink water, and with this regimen it is necessary that it be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a bloodsucker from the throat is treated when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps in some ways, but has a curve in it in some places. Which is placed on the throat, and its tip is similar to a stork's beak, which is smooth, where a file has been applied so that, when grasping something, it doesn't slip.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discussion on the appearance of abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are many types, of many varieties, according to their appearance, each described in this book.
And they are diverse in their opening and incision in two ways, of which one is according to the nature of the abscess itself; and according to the moisture we find in them.
And the second way is according to the location on the body where it occurs, for an abscess in the head is different from an abscess in the buttock; and an abscess in fleshy tissue is different from an abscess in a joint; and for each of them there is a judgment for the operation.
And further, some abscesses should not be opened until the pus has matured within them or reached fullness.
Other abscesses should be lanced when they are inflamed and have not matured according to their fullness, such as abscesses near the joints, for when an abscess is near a joint, its existence is prolonged until that which is in its surroundings is corrupted, and the ligaments or nerves of that joint are severely damaged, which causes the contraction of that limb; or it is near a vital limb, and if you delay its incision until it matures, it may harm the limb; or if it is near the anus, then lance it unripe;  and you should not lance one that is inflamed, incompletely formed, unless it is near the anus, so as not to pierce the rectum and cause it to extend to the internal parts of the anus and create a fistula or damage the area beyond repair. But you must know the time for opening the abscess, and this is when it has matured.
And you know that it has matured when there is a cessation of pain and fever, and a decrease in swelling and throbbing, and the sharpness of the abscess head, and the other signs.
And therefore, you must make the incision at the point of the pus beneath the abscess and from the pus coming from the inflammation's surface.
And the incision should always be along the flesh or the body, if the abscesses are in the limbs or feet, and in places away from the tendons, nerves, or arteries; and, finally, in all similar places where there is no reflection; for in those that are reflected, use an incision suited to that particular limb.
However, when the abscess is in fleshy areas, it is better to let it be until the digestion within it is confirmed, as we have said; for if you incise it before then, you prolong the course of the illness and increase the unpleasantness, and the edges of the affected area become hard and deep.
However, some abscesses are incised across the width of the flesh or body, according to the need, or according to what the limb requires.
And you should make a small incision for small abscesses, and a large, wide incision or several cuts for large abscesses, according to the difference in size of the abscesses.
And for other abscesses where the skin should be scooped out and cut, when it is done in such a way that it can be left, as in those that occur with boils and buboes.
And some are incised with three angles; and some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the groin.
And others are those where a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are used, and similar ones.
But those that are not like that, as in superficial lion-like abscesses, you should pierce them with a superficial, or simply flat, incision.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should pierce it and not hurry to remove all the matter at once.  Having removed a portion, then close the abscess until the next day, and then remove a larger portion, and do this repeatedly according to a graduated process until it is completely drained.
And especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old, decrepit person, for the animal spirit is often weakened by the discharge of pus, and the patient easily dies, and you should be careful.
Guard this chapter with great caution, and after making your incision into these abscesses, you should clean the sores and consider whether the abscess wound is small, or a simple flat incision, in which case you should apply some linen or old cloth; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the incision are numerous, then you should place a medicament in each opening until they come together.
And if a part of the skin has been separated from the abscess or you have hollowed it out in the circumference, you should fill it with old cloth or a thread made from linen, as when you have extracted bread or roots, without moisture; and keep it tight for up to three days; and then you should proceed with the treatment and cure it with the appropriate ointment until it is healed.
But if blood flows during your operation, then you should apply cold water and vinegar in which you have soaked a linen cloth, and place this over the area of the bleeding repeatedly.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must administer a regimen and cure, using the powders which are described in many places in this book and in the divisions.
But if it is wintertime, and the area of the abscess is a region with many nerves, then you should mix powders in warm wine and oil, and apply these to the affected areas.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders mixed with water and oil, or with wine and oil, and keep them cool until the third day, as we have said; and then you should drain the abscess, cleanse it, and administer the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for understanding the cure of abscesses in general, but according to the method of distinguishing, I have already described how each type of abscess should be treated, separately, in chapters.
Chapter 41.
Of the incision of abscesses that occur on the nape of the neck.
Small abscesses occur on the nape of the neck, and these are of various types of nodes, which have tunics formed around them; and the types of their contents are various.
And some of them contain pus, and some of that contain moisture resembling lime. And some of them contain moisture resembling dust, and similar to them; and some are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, since extracting them does not cause a contrary effect on the body.
And the procedure for incising them is that you probe them with an instrument shaped roughly like this, called a probe, until you know what they contain.
If what it contains is moisture, then you incise it with a lengthwise incision, a superficial incision in this manner:
And begin the incision from line B to line G.  Therefore, once the moisture has been evacuated, you then scrape away the skin that contained the moisture, and do not leave behind any residue whatsoever, for it frequently returns if any residue remains.
Then soak a cloth in Egyptian ointment, if available, or otherwise in water and salt; and fill the wound with that and leave it until the next day, for this will corrode any remaining bits of the skin.
And then apply Egyptian ointment to that cloth a second and third time, if necessary, until you are confident there is no remaining residue of the skin; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then you incise it in this manner: with an incision shaped like a cross, and insert hooks between the two edges of the incision and scrape it from every side, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane which contains it.
But if your effort encounters resistance, then do what I have previously described.
And similarly, do the same for a stony abscess in terms of incision and treatment as we have told you; and an incision on a stony abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are on the head in some men, in which there is no moisture at all; the reason for this is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if one had struck someone with that, it would have hurt them.
However, for other abscesses occurring on the head besides this one, this chapter does not apply, such as abscesses that form near the heads of children and around the roots of the ears, but the incision of all these should be a superficial one.
And make the perforation of those in the lower part of them so that the body is relieved of the pus in the lower parts.
And then treat those with what is suitable for that treatment.
Chapter 42.
Of the incision of scrofulas (tuberculous swellings/inflammations) which occur in the neck.
Often these abscesses appear in the neck and armpits and groin; and sometimes they appear in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, and many are engendered among them, and every scrofula of those is within its own tunic/covering, and thus, like the knots and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for some of them are stony/hard, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant, which do not yield to healing.
Therefore, in the one that you find to be in good condition upon examination, of which the manifest colour is close to the colour of the carbuncle, and is swollen on every side, and is not connected to the nerve of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, and is not deep, you should incise it with a superficial incision from the upper to the lower part of the body, along the line from G to B, and dissect it completely, and gently separate the edges of the carbuncle with a forceps, or with many forceps if needed, as we have described for abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is more important that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And if the pus is not very acute, do not apply your incision forcefully or distress the patient, and do not cut what is not necessary to cut; for if you cut a vein or artery and impede your operation, then apply crushed vitriol or other powders that stop bleeding, and compress the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides and the wound is softened and begins to suppurate. When the blood is drawn/removed.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then, check with your index finger if there are any other small causes of the scrofulas, therefore cut those and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofulosis, it is necessary then not to cut that scrofulosis from its roots. Before that, you must tie that with a tightly folded bandage and leave it until it falls away by itself without harm.
And then, fill the wound with old linen, which you have already dipped in Egyptian ointment, and then treat that.
And if you cut the scrofulosis completely, then you must bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch it up as soon as there is no more excess fluid.
But if you see that there is excess fluid due to the size of the scrofulosis, you must understand to cut the root of that, and draw it out and administer stitches and what is stated.
And that scrofulosis containing moisture, pierce it with a superficial puncture where you see the location of its maturation, and place a puncture below the pus of the body, as we have said.
And then administer a puncture, possibly with ointments and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And when you see the wound already cleansed, then you heal it with a regenerating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Of the incision of the abscess's pus in the throat.
The ancients described this incision in the abscess, but no one in our land has seen it done.
And this is the writing of their speech.
However, in people with back pain, the removal of the abscess should be avoided, because it would not be beneficial, as all the veins and major organs of the patient are located there.
However, in those who have hot abscesses in the mouth, throat, or ears, when the illness is not in the throat, one should use the incision of the abscess to avoid the harm done by cauterization.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the abscess below three or four small circles around the abscess,  along a line between two circles, making the incision in a semicircle, not into the cartilage, because this location is suitable for incision, as it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant.
And if the physician is hesitant, then he should extend the neck's cartilage with a probe, and then cut the cartilage until it reaches the canal, but avoid the blood vessels if any are visible.
And then, cut the semicircle as we described; and the incision of the canal is indicated by the pus that flows out with the broken tissue and by the cessation of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time for the perforation is past, bring together the two edges of the wound's cartilage, and stitch them together without including the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote healing until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the treatment we have described is no more than this: you see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the patient's airway, and the patient is close to death, and the patient's breath is cut off, and some people cut the epiglottis so that the patient breathes through the wound for some breathing, and may be saved from death.
And therefore, I command that the wound be left open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed; and the malignancy lasts for three days; and then, I command that the wound be stitched up, and heal it until it is healed.
And this I myself have seen, that a servant took a knife and placed it in her throat and cut a portion of her lung's airway.  I was called to treat her, and I found her gasping as one does in death, and I uncovered the wound and found little blood coming from the wound.
Therefore, I was informed that she had not cut a vein or artery, and the air was coming from the wound, and I treated it until she was healed.
And it happened to the servant only because of difficulty in breathing, and after some days she returned to a healthier state.
And now I say that there is no fear in the cutting of an epilepsy.
Chapter 44.
Of the incision on an abscess that occurs outside the throat, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and it is very common in women.
And it is in two ways, for either it is natural or accidental.
And in the natural case, it is not subject to being cured.
And the accidental case is in two ways, one of which is similar to fatty lumps, and the other way is similar to an abscess formed by the blockage of an artery, and in that case, there is fear. And one should not use iron cautery on it except in the case of a small one. And you should test it and investigate it with the said tool, and if you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should incise it as you would with tumors, and remove whatever is contained within the skin and bursa; but if not, then the whole nature of it should be investigated, and then treat the area with what is needed for its healing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Of the cutting of the types of tumors.
There are many types of tumors, and I have already described all their types in the division.
And it is necessary for me to recount here the difference between a tumor and a fistula, in case of doubt.
Thus, I say that with a fistula, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the superfluity is subsided; and when putrefaction is complete, then the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a tumor, there is no heat, fever, nor pain, and it resembles that lion-like swelling that is in the proper sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a small bump and is formed like a sac, whether larger or smaller.  There are two types, for it is either fatty and contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I have stated in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a tumor, you should explore it and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument called an *intromes* (probe), as its form will be shown in the chapter nearby.
And this is the method of inquiring into abscesses and all tumors:  you should take this instrument and insert it into the most moist area you find in the abscess, and you should rotate your fingers with the small instrument bit by bit until you know that the instrument has pierced the skin.
And then, place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then withdraw the probe and consider what has come out on its tip.
And if the flowing moisture, whatever its color, is expelled, then you should cut it with a superficial incision as I have described in other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture on the probe's tip, then know that it is greasy (or fatty).
And dry it with a cross-shaped incision following this shape: In the way I have shown you, and suspend it with tongs, and scrape away the scab from all sides easily, and keep the skin or sack, if possible, over it, and extract that pus with the needle.
But if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the pus at once, and often this happens, and then you extract it in pieces until nothing remains.
For if any part, little or much, remains, the needle will return according to the [nature of the] ailment.
And if you see that any small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and compress the wound, and apply a hot poultice over it, and treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, then you suture the two edges of it and treat it with whatever causes it to heal.
But if there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein there, then you cauterize and fill the area with crushed vitriol, leaving it tight for two or three days until the wound can heal and the blood's boiling stops; then return to incising what remains of the wound.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary for incision and perforation.
Of those which are the forms of the instruments, and are of three kinds: some are large, some are medium-sized, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They should be made of iron, of bronze, with their extremities nicely sharpened, so that they easily enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called probes, and one of them is called a lancet.
And there are three types, for some are large, medium, and small.
The form of the large instrument, its shape:
The form of the medium instrument, its shape:
The form of the small instrument, its shape:
It is suitable for those abscesses, boils, fistulas, and buboes, because within them are the bones and other things.
And make them round, thick, sharp, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of citrus wood, or of wood or iron, or silver.  And the best are when made of citrus wood.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which is believed to open the fistulas in whose cavity are reflections, which are reflected by their lightness through those reflections.
And there are three types, for some of them are long, and others are medium, and others are short, according to the size of the fistula and its constriction.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the medium lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the probes are of many types, for some are simply single curves, and these are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them are some probes that are hollow, and these are of three types.
And of those are probes having two curves, and these are of three types.
And of them are some having three curves, and these are of three types.
And all of these are necessary in their place.
Form of a small simple probe, its form:
Form of a large probe having two curves: Form of a medium probe having two curves: Form of a small probe having two curves:
Form of a large probe having three curves:
Form of a medium probe having three curves:
And these are the forms of scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut and cauterized, and they are of three types, for of those there is a large, medium, and small one.
Form of a large scalpel:
Form of the medium scalpel:
Form of the small scalpel:
The ends with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are blunt, and they are not positioned in such a way that the incision of the nodes is quickly done without fear of cutting a vein or nerve, so that the patient is healed and finds a little tranquility from the burning which is found around the opening of the abscess.
And these are the forms of lancets, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of iron and are similar in shape to a ray, with which alcohol is applied.
And it has a pointed tip concealed by a sheath, and in that case it can be moved inward and outward, as you see fit.
The forms of lancets, which are hidden between the fingers to pierce abscesses, and which the patients do not perceive, come in three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those (lancets):
The forms of cupping cups, with which the flow of blood is drawn, are of three types: large, medium, and small; the shapes of them are:
They are made of citrus wood, round with some length, and are thin.
And these types of cupping cups—large, medium, and small—are needed so that blood flow can be drawn quickly when necessary, and then, when first applied, it is not a medicine.
However, do not use them to draw blood from everywhere on the body, but only in fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, the muscles of the arms, breasts, belly, knees, and similar fleshy and moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments like thin-skinned sacs are made in this shape; with which blood is drawn when performed by phlebotomy, or by cutting a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round in this shape:
Chapter 47.
Of the treatment of male breasts that resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell during sleep, as they begin to become hairy, and the breasts swell, and resemble those of women, and become pus-filled, painful sores.
And whoever sees this, must cut those with a lunar incision, following this shape, from line B to line G, and then scrape away all the swelling, then fill the wound with a flesh-colored medicine, and then stitch the two edges of the wound together, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the breast descends and is softened by its size, as happens with women's breasts, then it should be cut in two layers, with two lunar-shaped incisions, each one contained within the other towards the end of each, until the larger line encompasses the smaller one, following the form of line B and line G.  Then, scrape away the tissue between the two edges of the wound, and remove any excess fat. Then, apply the treatment of stitches and powders as previously mentioned for healing, until healed.
And if you do not complete the incision needed due to the patient's discomfort or bleeding, then fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it has corroded away any remaining fat, and then treat it until healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the lancing of abscesses arising beneath the skin.
These abscesses that arise beneath the skin are a type of scrofulous, hard swelling, containing a pouch-like skin.
And some of these contain moisture; and those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, following this figure: from line G to line B.  And when all that is in the abscess, including the pus, has been evacuated, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until the following day.
And then the cotton should be removed and the area treated with a suitable ointment until healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes, or of the scrofulous variety, then you incise it in the same manner as we described in the section on scrofulous swellings.
If the ulcer has spread to the point of suppuration, then apply a cautery to it as previously described.
Chapter 49.
Of the incision of abscesses that occur from arrow wounds or vein wounds.
When an arrow wound is inflicted, and the scab over it becomes consolidated, abscesses often develop.  The signs by which one recognizes that an inflammation or abscess is caused by an artery or vein are:  when an abscess is caused by an arrow wound, it is usually located more superficially on the body; and if you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel a whistling sound (or "stridor").
And the one caused by a vein is deep and evident within the body.
And incision on this abscess is dangerous, especially those beneath the armpits, in the joints, in the neck, and many other parts of the body; if it is large, then its treatment with iron should be avoided.  The ones in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
However, for those that arise from inflammation of the wound opening from an arrow wound, make a longitudinal incision through the scab.  Then, using forceps, open the incision further and expose the arrow wound, freeing it from the surrounding tissues until it is uncovered.
Then insert a needle and drive it through to the other side, and pull the arrow out with a double-edged fillet in two places—which method I taught you in the extraction of two arrows lodged in the temples.
Then prick the area between the two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood is drawn out, and the abscess is dissolved.
Then administer treatment in the area where pus has formed until the ligaments have subsided; and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the abscess is due to a cut vein, then you must hold with your hand whatever you can of the abscess with the scab, and then insert the needle below the area that you have held with your hand, and drive it in; and have a double-threaded fillet there until you pull it through from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a strong ligament as I have shown you for a grape-like ligament, in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert the thread with the needle below the entire abscess, beneath the first incision of the needle, and tie your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it, until what is inside it comes out, then cut away the excess scab, and leave what is tied to it.
And then place a poultice, which you have soaked in wine and oil, on it, and then administer the treatment made with herbs and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess that arises from a twisting of the nerves.
Thus, abscesses occur in the arteries and veins, and similarly, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured by impact or by excessive strain, and by similar causes.
And it (the abscess) is most often found in the locations of the tendons or the heel, or in any place where the joints are injured.
And it is a serious abscess, and it is similar in color to the rest of the body, and it is in the worst of locations, without relief, and when it is tight with violence, it causes the patient to feel a kind of numbness.
And it is not an abscess that spreads throughout the body, and therefore is localized beneath the skin, and it is inflamed on all sides, and does not spread forward or backward.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be incised with iron, for a strong contraction will easily follow.
But that which is on the head or forehead, lance with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then cut it with forceps and excise it by the root.
And if it is large, then you suspend it with hooks, and scrape it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of the incision of an abscess that occurs in the cheil (lip) that arises in the abdomen.
Often, in the bellies of some men, and other parts of their bodies, there are many of these swellings that are called funguses because of their resemblance to fungi, whose roots are subtle and whose heads are large.  And the lips of these swellings are turned inwards, and it is one thing if it is small, and another if it is greatly enlarged.
And I myself have seen one, and in his belly were two swellings, which were more like funguses, and there was no difference between them; they were white, with fine roots.
And the lips of those were turned inward and split open, and moisture flowed from it constantly.
Therefore, I incised them and found in one a pus of eighteen ounces, and in the other six ounces.
And the procedure for their incision is that you should consider whether the patient is moist, and the color of the swelling is white, moist, and with fine roots; then you should cut it with a broad-bladed scalpel, and have cauteries at the ready in the fire, because often a lot of blood is expelled during the incision; and if blood flows out, cauterize the area.
And if the patient is fearful and trembling, beware of incisions with iron; but then take fresh lead filings and compress the swelling with it, in the manner we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the lead thread to the constriction; therefore, do not cease pressing the lead tightly on the swelling until it is severed and falls away by itself without effort.
But if the swelling has thick roots, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and apprehension, especially in that which is in the belly.
But it is possible that you should cut it in half, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to presume to cut a swelling that is dark colored, with little feeling, and slight tenderness, for that is possibly cancerous.
And I will bring a remedy for cancer to do this.
Chapter LII.
Concerning the treatment of a swelling of the navel.
A swelling of the navel is caused by various things; either by tears in the membrane covering the abdomen, and there the tissue or intestine protrudes as it does in other ruptures; or by blood flowing from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or by trapped air in the area.
However, if it is due to a tear in the membrane and the protrusion of tissue, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body; and it is painless, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then its location differs significantly from what we have described; and when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden, and returns afterward; and it is painful there, and is greatly swollen near the opening of the abdomen, and causes a lot of distress.
But if it is due to moisture, then it is painless, and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor swollen.
And if it is due to blood, then the abscess shows signs of a darkening color.
But if it is due to dead flesh, then the abscess is serious, large, and hard, and is embedded within a certain amount of tissue.
But if it is due to wind, then the touch of it is painless.
And the treatment for it is that you must consider if the swelling near the navel is due to blood from an arrow wound, a vein, or wind;  if it is, you should be forbidden from treating it, for in such cases there is danger and fear, as is taught in the chapter where I discussed abscesses from arrow wounds and veins.
And if the swelling near the navel is due to an intestine or hernia, then you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and stand extended; then gently probe around the entire navel with a probe, and tell them to lean between your hands on their sides, and then make a circular incision with a sharp scalpel around the area you have marked with the probe; and then cut open half of the abscess in the upper portion with large forceps; and then tie it tightly around the circumference with strong thread or a linen bandage, and tie it in a proper way.
Then lance the center of the open abscess over the ligament, and introduce your finger into that incision and search for the bowel; and if you find it and keep it held by the ligament, then gently pull it out and push the bowel back into the abdominal cavity.
And if you have found the hernia, then grasp it with forceps; and cut away the excess tissue.
But if it is an arrow wound or a vein, then circle around that area, and then return to your procedure; and take two needles, and put strong threads on them, and put the two needles into the circle you made around the abscess, in the shape of a cross, allowing them to penetrate; and then squeeze the abscess into four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and let the area be until the spread flesh softens and falls off on its own; or cut it when it is softened and about to fall off, and then treat it with whatever appropriate ointments are needed until it is healed.
If the protrusion of the navel is of flesh swelling there or due to moisture, then you must lance the abscess as we have said, and drain the blood or moisture you find there, and then treat it with whatever is appropriate to consolidate the area.
Chapter 53.
Of the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed, in the division, the types of cancer and how it is treated with medicine, and that surgical treatment with iron is dangerous because it may cause ulceration; and we have discussed cancer originating from the womb and the precautions for its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to remove it completely, such as cancer on the breasts or thigh, and similar locations on the limbs, by removing everything, especially when it is small and newly formed.
However, when it is advanced and severe, you should not try to remove it yourself, for I have neither been able to cure such a case nor have I seen anyone else do so, nor has anyone succeeded in such an undertaking.
And the operation in such a case, as we have said, is that you should first treat the patient and purge them of black bile in some cases, and subsequently bleed them if a clear accumulation of blood is found.
And then prepare the patient with the preparation appropriate for the operation, and then insert hooks into the opening, which are suitable for that; and then, with a sharp curette, carefully scrape away everything around it, until no trace of the cancer's roots remains. And let the blood flow, and do not cut it lightly, and press the affected area, and remove the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you have available.
However, if you encounter difficulty with thick blood flowing from a vein or artery, then cauterize that until the flow of blood stops, and then treat the area with the rest of the procedure until it is healed.
Chapter 148.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy caused by water, and the signs of each type, along with the treatment of them with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of dropsy that is caused by the lungs, and it is not appropriate to use iron for the types of dropsy caused by tympanites or hyposarcha, for that is deadly.
And when you have treated this type of tympanite dropsy with medicines and your treatment does not work, then consider, if the patient is already weakened, or has another illness alongside the dropsy, such as in the chest or belly and similar conditions, then be careful not to treat it with iron, for there is danger in that.
However, if you observe the patient to be of robust constitution, and has no other illness besides dropsy alone, and is neither a child nor an old person, then the method for treating them is that you lift the patient between your hands, and with the other hand, the attendant presses the patient's belly, forcing the water towards the lower part of the chest, and then take a spiny substance in this way:
It should be two parts long, pointed at one end, like a spiny substance; however, there should be some small shortening, gradually, so that during the procedure with it, you do not puncture the intestines and harm them.
And then consider if the dropsy originates from the intestines, because if so, you must, with your incision, move away from the navel by about three fingers towards the lower parts, to the right side of the body over the groin.
But if the dropsy originates from a liver ailment, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.
And your incision should not be on the side the patient is lying on, lest the excess fluids flow to that restricted area.
Then, pierce the entire membrane with the instrument, and then insert it into the incision.  Raise your hand with the spatula between the membrane and the skin, and scrape away a bit of it – if only the thickness of a fingernail or so.
Then pierce the skin until the spatula reaches the empty space, the space of the water. And then remove that and insert an instrument of this shape: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or brass or lead, on the lower part of which is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its end is cut in the manner of a feather, like this:
And on its uppermost end is a little ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately slips onto the instrument, thus evacuating a moderate amount of water at a time, because if you evacuate more than necessary at once, the patient is quickly endangered by the resolution of their animal spirit or by impending death.
But evacuate that according to the quantity of its power, and according to what the patient's condition, the pulse strength, and the patient's constitution indicates to you.
And then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water; this is because as soon as it is held by the cord that holds the hole above the [specific part], which I have told you to pierce in that manner.
And repeat the process on another day, if the patient tolerates it, and withdraw a small quantity of water, and do this for several days cautiously, and be careful of error until only a little water remains.
However, if you fear for the patient, and leave a large quantity of water, then treat that with hot sand burial, and encourage sweating in a bath, and expose to the sun for a long time; and treat it with drying medicines until it is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, the spleen, and the liver after the extraction of the water, according to what I have recounted in what has preceded.
Chapter 55.
Of the treatment of children who are born with the urinary openings not perforated.
Sometimes, one of the children is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urinary tract is not perforated (or is a narrow opening, or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with perforation as soon as it is born, using a very thin instrument, in this manner:
And then place a thin lead peg in the opening and bind it, and leave it for three days or four.
And when it wants to urinate, it should be allowed to urinate; and then return it [the peg].
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows onto the area will not allow this opening to close.
But that from which the opening is narrow should be treated with a lead peg, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
But those in which the opening is not in its place, as mentioned, and the cause of this is that of those, that is, the opening is near the end of the head of the penis, preventing urination inwards, until the penis is lifted by the hand to the upper parts, and it is not in a proper position, so that the sperm cannot reach the mother according to the correct course, and it is a very slow illness.
And the method of the operation in this case is that the patient should be placed on their back, and then lift the head of the penis with your left hand with a forceful pull, and cut the head of the penis from the place of the foreskin with a sharp scalpel, just as a feather is cut, or that you remove any part, so that the middle of it comes into alignment with the head of the penis, and that the opening falls into the middle place as it should.
And be careful that in your operation of blood flow, for many times this happens; and stop it with what you use to cut the blood, and heal the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Concerning the inflammation that occurs in the foreskin on the head of the penis, and the corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
Many times this inflammation occurs on the penis, and it is an eminence of a swollen, sore flesh.
And of those [inflammations], one is malignant and the other is not.
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine instrument and remove the affected part until it is all gone; then apply a compress soaked in Egyptian ointment; and after that, treat it with diachronic ointment until it is healed.
And if the inflammation is malignant, of a foul color, then you should apply cautery near its incision and root.
But if the inflammation is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and part of the inflammation is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you should remove the inflammation that is inside first until it is consolidated; and then treat the outside part, for if you treat both at once with the foreskin, there is no guarantee that it will not be torn.
And if you find blackness and corruption in the genitals and foreskin, then you should remove everything that is already blackened and about to corrupt or that is already corrupt; and then apply a poultice to that area made of honey mixed with crushed and sifted pomegranate rind and crushed herbs.
And then treat it with the other treatment until it is healthy.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply a lunar cautery according to this method:
for a helpful cautery is useful in two situations, that is, for a flow of blood and for a wound when it is corrupt.
And if the head of the penis is eroded and completely destroyed at once, then you should insert a lead cannula into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion only occurs in those whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required for them; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess) you should scrape with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all sides.
And if it is difficult to carefully separate them, then you should scrape away any cause of adhesion between the head of the penis and the foreskin, and this is because, when the foreskin is thin, it is easily perforated by its own thinness.
And then gently separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then it should be treated with astringent wine until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Of the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to those undergoing circumcision.
Circumcision is not a simple break in the skin like other wounds; however, since it is an act performed by us, at our will, and primarily on children, it is necessary that we assign to it the best possible method and the easiest way to achieve their health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience.  The reason for this is that I have found most skilled practitioners and barbers using circumcision and cleansing with a razor and with cauteries; and they use ligatures with thread and incisions with the fingernail.
And I have already tried all these methods, and I find no better cleansing than with scissors, with thread ligatures, than with fingernail cleansing, because often the skin is cut too deeply.  For the foreskin has two layers, and the inner layer remains, requiring further incision and causing unnecessary pain. And the cleansing that is done by alchemists, and is digital, which cobblers use, does not ensure the incision of the end of the male member, because it easily enters the opening.
But in the operation with a fingernail, it is very easy to cause bruising and damage your work. And the foreskin of a child is naturally short, and often is born in such a way that it does not require cleansing, and I have seen this.
But the cleansing done with scissors and thread ligatures, its goodness, experience has shown me, because the scissors are for proportional incisions, so that the sharpness on top is similar to the sharpness below; and thus when you press your hand it proportionally applies both sharpnesses, and cuts according to a comparison at one time; and a compression of the thread is applied, encapsulating the foreskin of the penis completely, with which no error is made at all.
And the first method of the operation is that you should position the child (preferably one that understands a little), and simply tie the thread to its penis, and leave it until the following day.
And then do this in a way that is possible for the child to receive their understanding. (or: in any way possible that is agreeable to their comprehension). And then, position the child between your hands in a prepared manner, and do not let them be afraid; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them, or any other instruments.
And then place your hand on the penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it back until the head of the penis is exposed, and then clean it of any impurities adhering to it.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning, this is the shape:
One end should be blunt and the other sharp, so that the nail's head doesn't come out, and the length of the two blades should be the same as the length of two handles together.
But the mistake in cleaning is that you forcefully remove the entire or part of the inner foreskin from the incision site.
Therefore, you should spread that part of it with your finger before the abscess is opened and cut it along the equal line.
And if you cannot hold it with your finger, then pull it out with forceps and cut it.
But if three days have passed, and that which is swollen below the penis remains after the abscess, then you let it be until the hot abscess has subsided, and carefully scrape it, and cut it according to your preparation.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for that will not help him.
And therefore cure that with the healing powder from the powders we have recounted in the treatise of powders.
And if it is cut from the tendon excessively, and you apply remedies to the parts above, that will not help him.
And further, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Of the cure for urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by an obstruction, either by stone or congealed blood, or by pus or other similar things, and is similar to those which we have discussed regarding methods of cure in the previous section.
And if the urine is not released using the methods mentioned, and the cause is severe, then it is necessary to extract it with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: it is made of silver and is a slender, hollow tube, like a small bird's quill, with a fine pointed reed or tube a length of one and a half palms at its end.
And the method of extracting the urine using this is to take a folded linen cloth, and wrap wool or cotton around its end for good binding; and place the ends of the linen cloth in the area beneath the syringe, and trim any excess cloth with scissors, but insert it into the tube with force.  Then, lubricate the syringe with oil and egg white.
And have the patient lie on their back, and lubricate their bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil, and ointments.
And then gently insert the syringe until it reaches the root of the penis; then bend the penis upwards towards the navel area; and then push the syringe into that; and then push it further until it reaches the bladder, and that will show the patient to have reached the empty cause, and this is not done in this order unless there is an abnormal curvature in the meat.
And then pull out the linen cloth with the wool, little by little, for the urine will soak the cloth.
Then extract it, and use the syringe for treatment, and do not stop using the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Of the quality of bladder enemas using clamps and similar instruments suitable for this purpose.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or congealed blood is present, or a blockage is formed, and you wish to instill liquids and medicines into it, then use an instrument called a clamp, and this is its form:
but instead, the end of it is closed, or sealed. And in that [closed end] there are three openings: two on one side, just like before.
At the beginning is a concave space, where the [material] that is driven in resides, and be according to the amount that fills it, without addition, until, when any cause draws moisture from it, it be drawn out, and when expelled, it also be drawn in, and when expelled far, as the clamp does to which naphtha is infused in sea battles.
Therefore, if you wish to inject liquids into the bladder, insert the end of the clamp into the liquid, and draw out that which is pushed towards the upper parts, for the liquid is drawn into the concavity of the clamp.
And then insert the end of the clamp into the penis, as we have recounted in the description; and then push the liquid with what you are pushing, for that liquid will immediately reach the bladder, and the patient will feel better.
Shape of the subtle instrument with which the bladder is drained, and this is the shape:
And it should be made of silver or lead, of which the highest part of the head should be like a small feather, and below it a tube within the ligament.
And then take a bladder, and place the liquid you wish to drain into the bladder, and then tie it together with strong double-ligatured thread, and heat that liquid over the fire.
And then insert the end of the instrument into the penis.
And then press your hand on the bladder with the liquid with a downward pressure until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and pierce it throughout its entirety; and then insert strong thread into those holes, twisting it; and then attach the circle as you would attach a stopper, putting the liquids, oils, and waters you want into it.
And then attach that to the instrument and use it as you did with the bladder, and express with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of stones.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder, and their symptoms.
And we have described the stones in which a manual operation, and a surgical incision, is necessary.
And the stone formed in the bladder is specifically the one that is located in the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear explanation and brevity.
Therefore, I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly affect children; and among the symptoms is that the urine released from the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his penis, often groans, and is often straightened; and with this, there is often a protrusion of the anus in some of them.
And the cure is easier for children before they reach fourteen years of age; and the cure is difficult in the elderly. But in the young, it is more manageable because it is among them (i.e., easier to treat when it occurs in younger people).
And for that in which the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.
Therefore, to arrive at a cure for this, it is necessary at the beginning to cleanse the patient with a clyster that removes all the impurities in their bowels; for this impurity sometimes prevents the stone from being expelled from the body.
And then the patient should be lifted with their feet and gently shaken and jostled so that the stone descends to the bladder's area or is dislodged from another area.
And then, perform that operation with your prepared hands, and the patient's hands should be under their thighs, so that the entire bladder is drawn downwards.
And then, extract it and all of it from outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately you proceed with incision upon it.
And if it does not entirely descend from your touch, then you must oil your left index finger, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if they are an adult, and insert it into their anus. And extract the stone until it is below your finger. And bring it little by little into the bladder neck.
Then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards, away from the place where you made the incision.
And tell the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and tell another assistant to, with their right hand, extend the genitals upwards, and with their other hand hold the groin, located below the genitals, away from the place where the incision is made.
And then insert the instrument well into the incision, which is shaped like this: And cut through what is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; let the incision be over that stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let a transverse incision be made, so that the incision outside is wide and narrow inside, according to the amount the stone protrudes from it as possible, and no more, for if you press too hard with your finger in the anus, the stone will move away from the incision and be expelled without difficulty.
And know that there is some part of the stone, an angle and margins, that makes its removal difficult.
And of that part, it is like a glans, round, and easily removed.
Therefore, if it is that part with its angles and margins, adjust it into the fissure.
And if it is not thus expelled, then you must either gently press on it, or press on it with a suitable instrument, the tip of which is like a file that you press on the stone, and do not move it from there; or that you insert beneath it a thin, curved instrument.
But if you cannot do that, then you enlarge the hole slightly, and if you see blood flowing, bind that tightly with powdered vitriol.
But if the stones are more than one, then at the beginning you press your hand on the opening of the bladder, and then cut on it; and then gently press near it; and do similarly if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is unwise to cut it with a large incision, for you cause the patient one of two things: either death or a continuous dripping of urine, because the area is not completely healed.
But administer a method of expulsion until it is expelled, or use the forceps to fracture it until you extract it in pieces.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe juice and dragon's blood, and bind it tightly. And place over that a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in warmed oil and cold water, so that a festering boil may subside.
And then lay the patient on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you have removed that, smear the area with water and a little oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound a festering, burning, and corrosive abscess develops, and it resembles solidified blood in the bladder, and because of this, urination is blocked (and this is known by the presence of blood in the urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it causes corruption of the bladder and then putrefaction.
And then wash the wound with sour wine, water and salt, and with whatever appropriate application is suitable for its treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary during all the treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medications that have been applied to the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the urethra, embedded within, and urination is also blocked, then treat it with what I have previously recommended before resorting to surgery, for many times this treatment has been accused of leading to surgery; and I myself have tested this, and it is that you take a sharp, pointed iron drill, of which this is the shape:
of triangular tip, sharp, fitted into a handle.
And then take a bandage, and bind the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, piercing it easily until the drill reaches that stone. And turn the drill with your hand on that small stone bit by bit, and you enlarge the hole until you make the other side penetrate; for the urine will be released immediately.
And then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outer part of the penis, for that is broken, and expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not suitable for you for any reason that prevents it, then bind a bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. And then apply cautery to the stone in the penis between the two bandages. And then remove that (referring to the stone). And then loosen the bandage and clean the congealed blood, which is formed in the wound.
And a bandage below the stone is not necessary, except to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other bandage above it is not necessary either; for when the bandage is removed, the stone exits, the condition returns to its place and heals the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the bandage above, it is necessary for you to lift the condition upwards or that it returns to its proper position, and the wound heals as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Of the extraction of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
But if a stone is found in any of them, then the cure is difficult, and there are many methods for it.
One of them is when the woman is very young and a virgin.
And the second is that you do not find a woman sufficiently knowledgeable to reveal herself to the physician when she is chaste, or is one of the women with husbands.
The third is that you do not find a woman well versed in this art, especially the surgical operation by hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision for a stone in women is distant from the location of the stone, requiring a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
But if necessity compels you to do this, then it is necessary for you to take a skilled female physician, and few are found.
But if you are deprived of such a woman, then seek a skillful and subtle male physician, or present a matron well-versed in women's issues, or a woman who has a deep understanding of this art.
Therefore, have this woman present, and command her to do everything you tell her, from the examination of the stone at the beginning; this is so that she can ascertain if the woman is a virgin, and then it is necessary that she insert her finger into the woman's vagina and seek the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, hold it under her finger, and then command her to make an incision above it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder, and squeezing it gently.
Therefore, if she finds it, then it is necessary to gradually remove it from the bladder opening to the lower parts, using the full strength of her power, until it reaches the root of the thigh.
And then make an incision above that, approximately halfway down the vagina near the root of the thigh, wherever the stone is lodged, and place the stone in that area, and the finger should not be removed from the stone, holding it under.
And the incision should be small at first; then insert the tool (or probe) into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then make the incision according to the amount that it is known the stone will be expelled from that location.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and sharp and rough, and long and round, and having ridges.
So you know how many types there are of it, so that you may indicate what you want about it.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the area and keep it there for an hour until the blood is stopped, and then return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
And prepare the instruments needed for removing stones from men, so that you may be aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and know that the expulsion of blood is from the incised artery, then you place powder on the area and compress it with poultices and a tight bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not remove it, for the patient will likely die quickly. And then treat the wound.
So, after the flow of blood has ceased for a few days, and the area has healed, then you return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
Chapter 62.
Of incision on a strangulated hernia.
An acute hernia is nothing more than a collection of moisture in the white sac, which is beneath the groin fold containing the testicles, and is called the sac.
And sometimes it is in the proper pouch that nature has prepared in the area of the testicle, until such time as another testicle is already present; and it is the groin fold between the white sac that we have mentioned, and this is nothing but a tumour.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the testicles, so that this material is poured into them, and sometimes it results from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colours, for its colour is either inclining to yellow or blood-red, or reddish, or black and slimy, or watery and white, and this is what matters most.
And the signs by which one knows where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white sac we mentioned, then the abscess is round, inclining slightly to length, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle appears, because the moisture contains it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper pouch, then the abscess is round with a part of the testicle, and thus one thinks that it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the scrotum and the white sac, then it is felt lower down.
And if you want to know the color of the moisture, then you probe the color of the moisture in the abscess with a pointed probe, the shape of which is known beforehand; and according to what comes out on the trace of the probe, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we come to treating it with iron, then it is necessary to order the sick person to be bled if it is possible for you, and to see if their body is full.
And afterward, let him be placed on his back on something a little raised, and put many cloths underneath him.
And then, sit on the left side of the patient, and instruct the attendant to stand on the right, extending their stick to one or two places at the scrotum and the abdominal cavity.
And then, take a sharp spatula and split the scrotum in the middle lengthwise, up to the pubic area.
And let the incision be made along a straight line, equally distant from the line where you have separated the skin of the scrotum, until it reaches the white tissue (or membrane) encompassing it.
And scrape that away, and observe, and be careful not to cut that; and your scraping tool (or instrument), with which you scrape that away, should be suspended with a thin thread and carefully examine the scraped area to the best of your ability.
And then pierce the water-filled sac with a wide opening, and remove all the water.
And then separate the two flaps of the incision with forceps, and spread the sac open; and do not touch the scrotum encompassing the testicles, and cut the sac in such a way as is possible for you. And cut that completely or into pieces, and especially the thin side of it, for if you do not carefully examine the incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
However, if the sac protrudes from its sheath during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the sac, return it inside, and then suture the two flaps of the scrotum encompassing the testicles together, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the sac corrupted by another disease, then you must tie the vessels that are around the suspensory ligament, and remove the sac, and then treat it with what we have said.
But if the water is gathered in two parts, for example, then know that there are two hernias; therefore, incise that part as you have done in the other inguinal area; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then do it as one.
And then you cleanse the blood, and place wool soaked in oil or warmed oil in the incisions; and put another piece of wool soaked in wine and oil over the testicles and the navel area; and place over this folded cloths and powders, and bind them together with a bandage in the following manner:
And then take two cloths and fill them with softened wool according to this shape; and make the extremities with which it is compressed of cotton or damp wool, and attach them with a strap to the breeches; and one of the extremities should reach from the bottom to the top of the legs, and the other end to the crotch area; and two extremities on the thighs underneath and two more on the hips, and all straps should be fastened to the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with a cautery instead of cutting with an iron; and for this you should take a sharp, small scalpel and use it to cut the skin around the genitals and heat it as we have described until the white sac containing the water is exposed, and then use a cautery in this way: And it resembles a Greek letter.
And then pierce that sac, and continue to heat it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then pull the sac out with hooks, and scrape it with heated, small cauteries; and cut it as much as possible until you eradicate everything; and be careful that the egg [possibly referring to the testicle or some part of the sac] is not touched by the fire.
And know that this operation is safer and further from blood loss, and better than an operation with a cut/incision.
However, if during the incision or cauterization, or during blood loss, you encounter a contrary issue like an abscess, then you must treat whatever contrary problem you face, with a treatment suitable to it, as is described.
However, if the patient is fearful and does not await the second operation because of its horror, then administer the perforation as I recommend; and this is when you are certain, based on what we have said about the significations, that the hernia is acute.
Then you must have the patient sit on a slightly raised surface; next, pierce the abscess in the lowest part of the body with a broad spatula, and make the puncture along the length of the body.
And make the opening wide until all the fluid drains out.
And then place a cloth over the area, compress it, and leave it so that the remaining fluid drains out. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
However, if there is resistance to the drainage of fluid at that time, you pierce it.  This is done because a white membrane in the wound opening causes resistance and prevents the fluid from escaping.  In this case, you should insert a suction instrument (similar to one used to draw water from hydrops) which is preceded by a description; or apply a slight pressure to the wound opening.
And know that the fluid returns and gathers again, approximately every six months or thereabouts.  When it gathers, it should be pierced again in the same way, for the patient will thus pass their days.
Chapter 63.
Of the incision on a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this hernia, there is a fear of harm in the more serious cases; for I have seen its dismissal and been saved by this better [method/approach].
And I remember the operation on that and the kinds of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the parts where the humors are collected, and this happens for many reasons: either due to a sharp, severe excess that is discharged into the parts, or due to a blow.
And the color of the abscess corresponds to the color of the affected area, and if there is no pain in the location, it is a serious abscess.
And a hardened abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation there, is a very serious one.
And sometimes it is caused by the constriction of the arteries, and by swelling of those, as is already perceived by recalling it, or by swelling of the veins.
But that which is caused by the swelling of the arteries is recognized by the dispersal of the abscess when you press on it with your fingers; and it should not be touched.
But that which is caused by the swelling of a vein is not dispersed by any means through pressing it with the fingers.
And it is possible that on this type [of abscess], a cutting be made on the surrounding flesh; and you should cut into the sheath of the genitals, then spread the testicle to the upper parts, and remove it from the white sac, and loosen the suspensory ligaments, tie them, and cut the suspensory ligament further as you free it from all parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already attached to the surrounding flesh, then you should remove the testicle and cut it.
And if there is adhesion to any part of the sac, or between the vessels, then you must separate all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the location of the adhesion, which is behind, then you should cut everything that is there and remove the testicle as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool infused in rubbed oil and wine; and then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of inguinal hernia.
The inguinal hernia is a swelling enveloped by some kind of sheath, similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, making movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, caution is necessary, remembering what has preceded it.
However, it is necessary to describe the operation in the same manner as the first ones.
And I say that it is necessary to make the patient sit on a raised stool; then pull the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards; then grasp the scrotum with your fingers, including the veins that are visible on the penis; and have another assistant do the same, pulling vigorously.
And then, with a sharp, thin scalpel, cut across the veins until they are exposed.
And then, scrape away everything, as we have described in the extraction of arrows that are embedded in the temples.
And then, insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it to the first point where you find a vein, and tie it again to the back (or the other side) of it. And then, cut those (the veins) in the middle, lengthwise, along the body's length, and remove the accumulated foul and corrupt humours.
And then, treat the wound as you would other wounds where pus is expected to form, so that the veins which nourish one of the two [parts/regions] may fall; for this is not harmful.
But if you find veins throughout, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles become blocked with the veins, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the veins, and that they be withered, or that they become blocked so that they are not nourished by them.
Chapter 65.
Of the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture in the extended diaphragm over the abdomen, by one of the intestines being pulled out from the rupture onto one of the intestines.
And this rupture is either of the diaphragm or from a tearing of it, and these two types occur due to many causes: a blow, or a fall, or a loud cry, or by lifting some heavy object, or similar actions.
And the sign of this, when it is due to a stretching of the diaphragm, is that it occurs gradually over a long period, and not suddenly, and it is a swelling that gradually approaches the navel because the diaphragm presses on the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a tearing of the diaphragm, is that it initially causes sudden, intense pain; and it is a diverse swelling apparent beneath the nearby ribs, and this is due to the displacement of the intestine, and the body of it is outside the diaphragm.
And sometimes the intestine is pulled out along with the tissue, and this is called a complete intestinal hernia.
And sometimes it is caused by gas, and sometimes a crack occurs in the intestine, and it is trapped there.  This is a great harm to the patient, and sometimes causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in treating these types of illnesses with iron, there is danger, so the use of that should be avoided.
And the method of operating on this is to tell the patient to push the intestine back into its cavity with their hand if it will return, and then place it over their stomach between your hands, and raise their legs.
Then tie off the cord that connects to the testicles above, and cut the cord of the testicles completely lengthwise; and then separate the edges of the cut with surgical hooks, as you would need to open the cut with those.
And if the cut is deep enough, you can hope the egg (testicle) will be expelled from there.
Then scrape away the tissue underneath the cord of the testicles until the hard white scrotum is exposed on each side.
Then insert your finger into the area where the testicle is, in the space between the white scrotum, which is under the cord of the testicle, and the scrotum again, and separate any adhesions that are behind the testicle.
Then, hold the cord of the testicles outward with one hand, and with the other, pull the white scrotum upwards, and elevate the testicle with the scrotum toward the incision;  and instruct the assistant to hold the testicle upwards, while you break the adhesions behind the testicle with proper means.
And with your fingers, check that there is no cause for the intestine to be wrapped in the hard white scrotum. But if you find any such cause, then you push it back into the abdomen below.
And then make an incision in the area below the testicles' cord, where blood and pus will flow, as we have described in what we have already stated.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound.  Apply the bandage we've described (and sometimes the white scrotum is cauterized, which we mentioned after the incision to prevent bleeding, as this often happens). Leave the bandage on until it falls off by itself.
However, if the wound's healing is delayed, then apply warm water compresses and keep them on until it falls off, as we have mentioned.
And then treat the wound with the usual treatment for wounds until it heals.
Chapter 66.
Of the windy hernia.
In this hernia, I have not seen anything that has been harmed by treating it with iron.
And the first doctors said it is done as we have described in the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision with ease; and then dry the area around the abscess with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away.
And treat the wound according to what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and you should empty the area.
And do not allow any cause of the intestines to remain in the groin; and if they do, it is little; and it returns at any time.
However, if the time with this extends, a fissure is formed in the groin into which the intestine descends; and this occurs due to the stretching of the groin, as we have said, which causes the groin to be stretched, and subsequently softened, and the area is suppurated and emptied.
And the treatment for this is with cautery, as was previously described.
And sometimes it is cured with a cauterizing iron in this way: the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then the area of the rupture and suppuration is dried with a cut or incision across the width according to the amount of three days.
And then tighten the white groin that is under the groin until it is uncovered.
And then take the rod and place it on the prominent area of the groin, and press it against the abdomen.
And then stitch the two prominent areas on the groin's rod's extremity together, and join them with stitches.
And then pull out the rod, and do not cut the groin completely, nor extend the [testicle/scrotum], nor any other thing, just as I have taught you in the treatment of an intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and as you would dress wounds, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is healed; for the groin is contracted and the rupture's prominence is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this location, for it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
Of the softening of the scrotum's hardness.
Often the hardness of the testicles in some men is softened by this, because the flesh that is between them is softened, and their watching over it is effective.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is engaged in the cure to have the patient lie according to his side, and to gently soften all the hardness that is above the natural hardness; and then to bring the two edges together with stitches.
And if you wish, stitch the excess softened hardness at the beginning with three or four stitches, and with firm sutures.
And then, cut between the stitches; and then treat with the cure for other wounds until it is healed and the pus has subsided.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
Know that castration, in our laws, is forbidden, but by reason it is allowed to me to remember it in this book; and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons: one is so that when a physician is questioned about it, he knows the cure for those affected; the other is that we often need to castrate other animals for our benefit, such as oxen, goats, pigs, and similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by a fissure/section.
But in that done by crushing, the method is to immerse the animal in hot water until its genitals are softened and hang down limp. And then grasp them with your hand until they are crushed and no longer appear beneath the touch.
But in castration done by fissure and section, you must hold the animal and press the scrotum of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut into each testicle with a section until both testicles are separated.
And then cut them further, once you have scraped each one. And do not leave on them any cause from the tunic, except for the subtle tunic which is on the vessels.
And this method of castration, which is done by friction, is better, for strong friction leaves no cause in the testicles by which the animal desires intercourse.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Of the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when a space appears in the scrotum, between the testicles, shaped like a woman's vulva, covered in hair.
And sometimes urine flows from the area within the scrotum.
But in women, it's a different type: the female vulva appears as if two testicles of a man have shrunk slightly and protruded on the exterior resembling a penis with two testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: for two types in men and one type in women. And it is necessary that you cut those adhering tissues until the protrusion subsides, and then treat them with the same treatment as other wounds.
And in the second type of male case where urine is in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Of swelling and protruding flesh, due to causes affecting women.
A mild swelling is caused by natural factors until it subsides and is barely noticeable; and sometimes it grows quite large in some women, spreading as it does in men and interfering with intercourse.
Then you should remove the excess swelling with your hand or a lancet.
And do not overdo the lancing, especially at the base of the root, lest it cause a flow of blood.
And then treat it with remedies for wounds until it heals.
But flesh born within the mother's womb, filling it, and protruding through the parts of her body in the form of a tail (and for this reason, some earlier physicians called it "tailed illness"); then we must lance it as we lance swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Of the treatment of erysipelas.
Erysipelas is a condition where the vulva of the woman is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is caused by an illness that has preceded it, and that illness is caused either by poorly adjusted flesh or by a subtle or thick (excessive) discharge.
And it is located either in the mother's womb, or in her ribs, or in the upper part of her body, or in the lower part of her body.  Avoid (prohibit) cooking, nourishment, and childbirth, and strongly prohibit menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by observing the woman; if the obstruction is apparent, treat immediately.  But if it is not apparent, then you should search for it with your words or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is caused by a subtle discharge, and it's located near the two lips, then you should cook and break it apart.
And you should place powders on the two lips, then gently place your index fingers from both hands on top (or near) them.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and then forcefully extend both lips until that subtle discharge is broken and the obstruction is opened.
And then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it over the area.  Let the person lie down with a companion by their side all day, so that the cut/laceration does not heal.
But if the discharge is thick and large, then it is necessary that you cut it with a sharp, flat instrument or a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to a clot, then suspend that with tweezers, and cut it.
And have with you the medicines that stop blood flow without causing injury, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and goose dung, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep it there for several days, and apply a warm compress.
And then it should be treated with other healing remedies until it is healed.
And sometimes there are injuries to the surrounding flesh, and then it is necessary to cut along this method. However, if this is due to a brain abscess, the brain abscess, which is in the head, should not be treated with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids, and of tail and red swelling that occurs in the vagina of women.
Hemorrhoids are the appearance of many veins around an opening such that from them flows much blood continuously; and if the hemorrhoids are old and are painful.
And I have already stated in the division the types of those [hemorrhoids] and the signs of those, and will now say which receive treatment and which do not receive treatment.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and painful ones, when they are deep within the rectum and do not appear on the surface, then treatment with iron should not be performed on them.
But those which are at the opening of the rectum, over which one feels [them], are those which are treated.
And you should place the woman in a cold room and then carefully cut them with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them along with their roots.
And then powder over them, to stop the flow of blood, with one of the incisive powders without causticity, like acacia and similar ones.
And then soak their feet for an hour, and then place them in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make that person sit in a decoction of the root and bark of pomegranates, and walnuts, and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a poultice with this and place it on the back of him/her.
And if the bleeding has stopped, good; and if not, apply two leeches, and to the breasts without incision.
And then take wool and soak it in the juice of coriander or the juice of arnica or the juice of comfrey mixed with diluted wine and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat it until it is healed.
Chapter LXXIV.
Of the perforation of a bone injury in the arm.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the arm, such as cancers, stony abscesses, ulcers, inflamed sores, creeping sores, fistulas, hemorrhoids, sores and swellings, and other abscesses. And I have already described these illnesses and their types, their symptoms, and their cures in the division.
And it is necessary that I describe in this treatise the hot abscess which comes in the arm when it is of the abscesses that collects pus, and if you wish to know in what manner the operation of it is performed with iron.
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is sharp with percussion and phlegm and fever, and if it is sometimes red and if you touch it you feel it, then do not rush with puncturing it, and treat it with that which assists in maturation until the sharpness of the condition subsides.
Then it is necessary that you have the woman lie on a table with two surfaces; and have her recline on her back and place her feet at the furthest part below her stomach, and have her thighs spread, and place her arms beneath her elbows, and bind each with a suitable bandage.
And then the midwife, standing on the right side, administers the instrument with which the opening in the arm is made, the form of which will be evident in the procedures which follow.
And when you wish to administer this instrument, you must insert with the shaft the tip of the woman's arm, and that which from the instrument enters the arm should be only the tip of the arm and ease the patient's pain. But if the instrument is larger than the tip of the arm, then you must place powders on the texture of the arm's tip, so that the entry of any instrument into the arm's tip is prevented.
And you must place the string that runs through the instrument on the side that is above, and the administrator must hold the instrument and turn the string until the opening of the arm is made.
And when the discharge appears, and it is touched by the hand and is bloody and moist, then you must dry that part of their head with a soft cloth.
And when the blood is evacuated, then you must place on the wound a compress soaked in rosemary oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the bandage over the wound on the arm's tip.
And place outside the arm, and on the bandage, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then it should be treated for about two days with an ointment suitable for this purpose until it is healed.
And sometimes the arm and the wound are washed in such a way that it is treated with water and honey, and then with water in which lily root or long-stemmed iris has been boiled, and then returned to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep inside the arm, then you must refrain from treating it with iron, and treat it with what we have discussed in the previous section.
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives how to treat living infants when their birth is not natural (or in a difficult way).
It is necessary for the midwife to know the signs of a natural delivery from the beginning.  So, when you see the woman straining downwards, breathing heavily and desiring fresh air, and she is relieved by what is above her in the process of delivery, and hastens the infant's emergence, then know that this is a natural delivery.  The infant emerges with its head first, and the afterbirth is either hanging or attached to the umbilical cord.
Therefore, when you see those signs, then the mother's abdomen should be compressed so that the baby descends easily. For when it descends with its head first, it leaves the afterbirth, which is purged of superfluities through proper cleansing.
However, a birth that is different from this is unnatural and undesirable. For when the infant emerges feet first, or the body comes out before the head and the feet, or one hand or the foot comes out first, or the head, or one hand, or it emerges towards the belly, and its posture is strongly turned towards its neck,  these are undesirable forms of birth.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and skillful in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what ingenuity is in them, so that it is signified by this and based on this.
When the birth takes place with the head emerging naturally, and this is difficult and laborious for the woman, and sometimes her strength is weakened, then administer a sitz bath or have the women use it, and vaporize the area with collected fenugreek and moist oils.
Then the midwife should insert her fingers between the membranes, and separate the afterbirth, or cut it with her fingernail, until it is freed from its moisture. And press the woman's abdomen until the child descends.
But if it does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be treated with a poultice of ptillium and fenugreek with cumin.
And then command the patient, or apply the poultice, to cough and sneeze with determination; and hold the patient's mouth and nose for an hour, so that the child will be expelled soon.
And if the two hands of the child are expelled at the beginning, then you should gently return them slowly, bit by bit. But if it does not go back inside, then place the woman on a stool and lift her feet up, and then lower the stool towards the ground; and the woman must be held to prevent her from falling during the movement.
And if the hands are not returned inside and the child dies, then cut those open and remove the remaining parts of the child or tie the child's body to the hand with a cloth and remove it evenly, for that will be expelled.
When the child is on its feet, then you should push them upward, and then gently turn the child over, then swallow it down, then grab one of its feet and slowly extend it.
But when it has come out between the thighs, then you command it to strain, and make it sneeze with force, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have described, then you return the child slowly until you have placed it in its natural position, for it will then be expelled with easy birth.
And if it is still not expelled by all that we have described, then take marshmallow root and dissolved gum, pound them thoroughly in a mortar, and then apply this mixture to the vulva, at the lower part of her abdomen. And then apply a poultice in warm water, until it reaches the hypochondria (lower ribs/side of the chest).
And when the areas below her are soothed, then give her a fumigation of myrtle and place it beneath her. And after the fumigation has been applied for an hour, then make her sit on a cushion, and make her sneeze, and pinch her nose, and remove [the cushion/the source of the fumigation], and gently compress the lower part of her abdomen, for the child will soon be expelled.
The child emerges lengthwise, hanging from one of its hands. Be ingenious in reducing the hand of her, but if you cannot reduce that, then lift the woman and make her go.
And if she cannot go, then make her lie on the bed, and forcefully compress her thighs, and then administer dressings that I and you have recommended for poultices.
And if labor has begun, then make her sit on a stool, and then study the reduction of the hand, and suck the child back into its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and command her to push until it is expelled.
The child is lying on its back, its arms outstretched, and its face is towards its mother's side. The midwife should hold the child's hand and gently and easily turn it around.
And when it is sucked back in, then put on its forehead what we have recommended of oil and poultices.
And then tell her to move slightly, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a stool and tell her to lean on her right side, and then tell her to push; and make her sneeze with conditions. The preparation of the dead fetus should be done on its side.
When the mother is delivered of the afterbirth in this manner, consider, and then you cut the placenta with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture.
And if the fetus is hanging by the face and neck, then you cut that of the umbilical cord, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then push the fetus into the parts within until you place it where it should be, and tell the woman to push herself several times, and it will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born frequently, and sometimes three or four, but that is strange and rarely happens; however, such things are outside nature, and not [considered] alive.
And count those, whether they have multiplied, as a second birth, and separate them by a cut, distinguishing between the ligaments at the umbilicus of each of them. And sometimes they are expelled just as a single fetus is naturally and easily, and sometimes this happens in an unnatural way, as we have reported.
And if some of them are difficult to deliver and reach the point we have described regarding unnatural forms, then treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and subtlety, and with patience, and is resourceful in every way according to the preparations made to bring about health.
A recollection of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and miscarriages.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten are formed in the mother's womb.  It has been verified by me that one woman miscarried six, and another ten, all formed, the cause of which was determined by the wise scholars.
And all this must be within the knowledge of the midwife, for it is easily overlooked in such small matters, and therefore she must attend to it carefully.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus using the methods we have described in the section on medical procedures, and it has not been expelled naturally, and you are forced to use manual procedures, then you must consider whether the woman is healthy and not suffering from any condition that might cause her harm.
Then the woman must be positioned on her back on the bed, and her head should be lowered and her thighs raised.
And the attendant should hold her in that position, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you should moisten the mother's mouth with moist oils and with mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then seek with her hand the location where she can hook her fingers into the fetus.
And suitable places for this: then consider if the fetus is positioned so that its head is downwards, and then you should hook your fingers into its neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or into the fork of the neck, or into the appropriate places on the sides, or under the ribs.
But if the position is with the feet downward, then in the groin, or in the middle of the back.
And you should hold the finger with your right hand, and place the curve of it in the space between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and hook the finger into any of those places we have mentioned, until you reach the empty space.
And then place another finger, or a third if necessary, on the side of it, so that there is a pulling force, and not only an extension, according to its direction.
And move it in all directions, so that its expulsion is eased, just as is done in extracting a tooth.
And it is necessary, in the space between them, that the extension be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some of her fingers with oil, and insert those fingers and turn around the retained part.
Therefore, if the part of the fet is forced out, then the fingers should be moved to a higher location; and do this until all of the fet is expelled.
But if the hand has slipped out before the other, and it is not possible to return it by compressing it, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until the whole is expelled, and cut it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus you must do the same for the other hand and the two feet.
But if the head of the fet is large, or if compression causes it to swell, or if water has accumulated in its head, then it is necessary to insert fingers between the spines of the vertebrae and break the head open and drain the water, or to cut it open with an instrument called "alundat," the shape of which will be found with the shapes of other instruments in the chapter that comes after this one.
And similarly, do so if the fet has a large head by nature: and then it is necessary to cut it with a scalpel, or to grasp it with an alundat as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head has slipped out and is compressed against the furcula, then it should be split open until the moisture that is in the foot is expelled.
But if it is not complicated, nor subject to swelling, then you cut the head as soon as possible.
And if the lower part of the belly is abscess-ridden or hydrops, then it is necessary that you pierce it until the moisture within it flows out.
But if the fet is on its feet, then the pull on it is gentle and the direction towards the mother's mouth is gentle.
But if it is compressed against the belly and the foot, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and cut open the belly and foot until that which is within them flows out.
But if the other limbs are removed and the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she should insert her hand into the air pocket, and search for the head with it, and pull it with her fingers towards the mother's mouth, and then insert a probe, or two probes, and pull it with them.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted by a hot abscess that attacks the area, then it should not be forcefully treated; instead, a soothing application of fatty, moist substances is necessary beforehand. And administer plasters; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the condition is on the patient's side, if possible, it should be lanced; and what we have said about a live fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave no cause within the second skin.
And when you have completed all your procedure, then administer what we have said about the treatment of boils, which occur from the mother.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then you should apply styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose belly a stillbirth had occurred, and subsequently, she became pregnant again, and another stillbirth occurred. A long time ago, a boil occurred on his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to treat him, and I medicated him for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
Then I applied some strong-drawing plasters to him, and a bone came out, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was very surprised, since there are no bones within the belly.
And then I thought that they were bones from the stillborn child.
Then I cleaned the wound, and removed many bones, the woman being in a very good condition, and she lived in this way for a long time, recovering from a little bit of pus.
And I did not consider this strange, but rather, as it is a science and an aid to what the skillful physician administers with his hands for healing.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary for extracting the fetus.
Form of dizziness with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of tightening in which the books are bound, with two twists at the two ends of two cords. However, this twist should be finer than a tightener, and should be made either of leather or of wooden dowels.
And let the width of each dowel be two fingers and the margin of each be one finger, and the length of each be one and a half palms; and in the middle place of the two dowels there are two joinings of the same dowels, already fastened, whose length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mother's mouth so that it is opened when you twist the two prescribed twists.
Another form similar to this, finer and lighter:
It should be made of leather or wooden dowels, in the style of forceps. However, at its extremity, there are two additions, just as before, and the length of these additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with these, then you have the woman lie on the bed with her feet hanging down, opening the space between her thighs. And then open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with scissors, to the desired extent of the opening of the mother's mouth until the midwife does what you want.
The form of vertigo that the ancients described:
A form of propulsion by which the fetus is propelled:
A form of friendship/assistance by which the large head is contained.
And it resembles forceps, with teeth at the extremity, as sometimes happens, and sometimes it is made long, like forceps, in this shape, as sometimes happens, having teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it is incised and contained. A form of slight assistance/help:
A form of a hook having a spine/point:
A form of a hook having two spines/points.
A form of a spatula having two ends, with which the head is severed/removed.
A form of two wide spatulas.
All those instruments, and the more their varieties are multiplied and prepared by craftsmen, the lighter their operation and the more valuable they are to people due to their quantity.
And do not neglect any of those instruments, wherever they are or if they are necessary for you, for the necessity of these is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should instruct the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a suggestion, and press your hand over her mouth and nose. If, through this, it comes out, it is good.
And if not, then you take a bowl and pierce a hole in the cover, and put in it herbs opening the mouth of the mother, such as mint, rue, anise, chamomile, Arabic cicada, cinnamon, and St. John's wort. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the bowl, and place that on the fire.
And then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's cavity.
And then make her sneeze, as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and it hasn't been expelled, then you order the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow decoction, and then introduce that into the vagina and try to pull out the afterbirth with it.  And when she has located it, she should take it and pull it out slowly. But if it is stuck to the mother's womb, then she should introduce her hand as we have described, and when she has found the afterbirth, she should extract it bit by bit according to the appropriate procedure, so that the mother does not suffer from sudden forceful traction. Before that, it is necessary that the [object] be moved easily to the right and left sides.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already described the treatment with sneezing and with herbal remedies.
But if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then be careful not to exert too much effort in trying to extract it. However, what has come out of it into the mother's mouth should be placed onto the woman's thigh.  Then, treat it with an ointment and a four-ingredient medicine; this will cause it to decay in a few days and it will dissolve and be expelled.
However, when it decays, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, and this affects the patient.  Therefore, fumigations and appropriate remedies must be administered.
But some of the ancients had already tested fumigations of narcissus and dried figs.
Form of instrument with which the woman is fumigated for the retention of menstrual blood and the afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or bronze.
And the slender end should be placed in the cone, and the wider end over the fire, and the fumigation should be placed over the flames of the fire.
And let that one remain until the fumigation is consumed, and then do another.
Of the treatment of the unperforated anus of the child.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which are already narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that narrowness with her finger; and if not, to pierce it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
And then place over it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to swallow.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to a consolidation of a plague or an abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then it should be treated with what we have mentioned about treatment and the use of lead.
Of the treatment of the fistulas that come afterwards.
Fistulas that develop in the lower part, often swollen and thick, which appear near the anus externally or within the area of that part.
And it is a fistula or many.
And when that swelling is old and comes from moist white fluid or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are somewhat penetrating.
And those that are penetrating are known because of what comes out of them through the discharge and by the windiness; and sometimes the patient experiences discharge, and often worms come out of them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the bladder, and into the opening of the penis; and some of those penetrating ones reach the joint of the thigh and the bone of the buttock.
And how a penetrating fistula is known to be in the anus and not penetrating is that you put your index finger into the anus, and you insert a thin probe of lead or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
But if there is twisting in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you don't feel any of that at all, nor does any discharge, worm, or windiness proceed from the opening, as we have said, then know that it is not penetrating, and therefore, cease your treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the opening of the penis, then the symptom is the emission of urine from there, and prohibition of that until the affected area is healed with medicine.
But if it is penetrating into the hip joint or bone, and pain radiates around it, then the sign is that the probe penetrates straight into the bone, if there is no twisting, and pain radiates around the affected area; and that it may persist permanently; and that no treatment nor ointment will heal it.
And in all these penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment of those is the work and vanity of foolish physicians upon whom you should not rely.
But in those that are not penetrating and are not old, healing with iron is expected, as I have told you, and as I have already tested.
And the patient should lie on their back with their hands under their hips, and raise their legs upwards, their thighs inclined towards their stomach. Then insert a lead probe, or a ram's horn if the fistula is twisted, until you know the point where the probe penetrates.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, then you must insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe penetrating on your finger, or if you feel something between your finger and that flesh or tissue, then you certainly know that it is penetrating; and therefore do not work on it, for there is no healing in it, as we have said.
But nevertheless, some might say that it heals in some men slowly.
And the treatment by which improvement is expected in him is that you ignite a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as previously described, and insert that heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all the flesh around the fistula-like reed-feather-tube has been cauterized.
And then treat it with some bandages until all that cauterized flesh is healed, and then treat it with medicines that promote flesh growth and healing. If it is healed, well and good; but if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate all the way to your finger in the anus, and between the probe and that, there is a thick layer of flesh or tissue, and the fistula extends to the surface of the bowel, then cut the bowel from the beginning of the fistula, and cut along with the probe.  Let the probe be in the fistula until the cut reaches the spot where the probe's tip ends, and by the probe, it is freed and extracted.
And then cleanse those fistula-like tissues which resemble a bird's feather quill, and no cause remains of them.
But if bleeding occurs between you and your operation when you are cauterizing those tissues, then the best and easiest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, for cauterization with fire possesses two beneficial properties:  it cauterizes the affected flesh, and it stops the flow of blood and removes excess moisture.
And then treat it with bandages or a dry cloth until the area heals, and then treat the wound with ointments that promote strong flesh growth and healing.
And those medicines which are astringent and desiccant; when this is done, it is already healed, and you need not fear a recurrence.
However, if the fistula extends to the anus and is distant from the body's surface, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
And if, upon probing, you find a membrane or flesh obstructing the passage, and it is close to the opening, then there is no operation there but rather a path of trust and hope.
This condition can be addressed in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or cut it open until you reach the cavity, allowing you to insert medicaments and facilitate healing.  Do not proceed with extensive cutting, as you might sever the surrounding tissue, causing further injury to the patient without their consent.  Afterwards, treat the area with the remedies previously mentioned; this will lead to a swift recovery.  Or, gently separate the membrane and cleanse the pus that collects there.  Cut the fistula as close to the anus as possible, as described previously, using a probe or another sharp instrument. Cleanse the ulcerated flesh created by the incision, allowing for scab formation.  Then, diligently strive to close the entire wound using surgical techniques. If the opening above is not yet healed, and the fistula persists in the anal region, the patient will suffer further, potentially serious complications. And sometimes the fistula presents in this manner: when you insert the probe into the fistula, it is located in the anal fold near the body's surface, with the opening along the rim of the anus.  In this case, take a probe with a pointed end, resembling a needle used to prepare thread for surgical use, in this fashion:
and insert it into the fistula wrapped in five threads or more;  and then introduce the threaded probe into the fistula until you reach the cavity within.
However, if the opening is close to the anal margin,  you withdraw the thread from the hole,  as if you were inserting your finger into the anus;  remove the thread tip,  and tie the two ends together, tightening each knot.  Leave it like this for a day or two.  If the thread has cut into the flesh,  tighten it further until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut and falls away.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and completely closed.
But if the fistula opening is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in whatever way is suitable for you, but don't press too hard, so you do not injure the sphincter; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the pointed probe used to open the fistula: one curve is very sharp, the other part is not, so that you do not injure what is not necessary, as often happens.
Of suturing hemorrhoids in which blood flows during the incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, either they are like lumps in the buttocks, or they are like bunches of grapes. And of these, some are small, some large; and the blood flows from them constantly, sometimes one, sometimes many, and they are sometimes outside the anus, and on its edges.
However, those outside the anus are according to the condition of low moisture, from which flows yellowish water or a little blood with a continuous consistency, and the color depends on the consistency.
And the treatment for those inside the anus is that you command the patient to sit and to strain until the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you grasp and lift them with tweezers or your fingernail, and then cut them away from their roots.
However, if the tweezers do not hold them due to their moisture and softness, then grasp them with a rough cloth, or cotton, or a piece of wool, and extract them with your fingers, and then cut them away and sprinkle some warm powders over the cut, so they act as a cautery in place of the cauterization; or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other remedies until they are healed.
And if the anus does not yield to discharge, then prick the patient with a small, biting cauterization, and wash it with whatever is in the anus, so that it yields to discharge easily when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause is superficial, and you should grasp them with your finger or tweezers, cut them, and then treat them with the remedies we have mentioned until they are healed.
And whoever has made an incision should administer sutures to them in this manner: take a linen strip and thread it onto a needle, then pull the hemorrhoids apart at the top edges, and make the needle pierce the root of the other side.  Wrap both ends of the linen strip on the lower side of the needle, laying them horizontally.  Tighten the hemorrhoid firmly, then tie the linen strip off and pull the needle out.
Do this to all of them, and leave one of them unsutured, so that the excess blood may drain from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in heated oil or ointment on the anus;  place it over the area and tell the patient to rest. And then leave it until it subsides; and when it has settled, treat it with ointments or other remedies until it is healed.
And when they are old and no longer respond to that treatment, then you must scrape them with the tip of a spatula or with your fingernail until they become moist and the scab of pus on top, which prevents them from healing, is removed. Then treat them until they are healed.
Then scrape them with a more forceful scraping than the first until much blood and scabs are removed; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that inflammation, this is key, and it is not anything other than a red round spot, resembling a flower bud, that is found throughout the body, but more so in the parts below the feet and in the fingers, and it is often the cause of pain in those places.
And then it is necessary to cut what is around the inflammation, and hold it with forceps or nippers, and to remove it from its root; and then treat that.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is explained in the previous chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, fistulous, round elevation on the surface of the body, and it frequently appears on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to scrape and cut it, or to press it with a file or a needle until it bursts. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
But a pimple is a small, festered or fistulous swelling on the surface of the body, often appearing on the forehead, and when the cold catches it, a sensation like an ant bite is felt, and it is formed around the body.
And its treatment is to take a hollow tube made from an eagle's or a vulture's feather, and make it strong, and place it over the pimple until the tube encircles the pimple's edges; and then you should rotate your hand with the tube so as to cut the material surrounding the pimple, and place it on the forehead of the flesh, and remove the pimple from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of bronze or iron according to this method:
Let the part above the tube be thin, smooth (that is, not pierced), wrapped so that the grip on it is reduced, and its rotation is easy.
And if you wish, cauterize the pimple as previously described in the cauterization of a boil in the chapter on cauterization.
Of the forms of instruments that are administered for the treatment of ulcers.
Sometimes ulcers are treated with silver or bronze or molten or hammered bronze; and sometimes they are treated with those small and large instruments according to those which are administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and those whose bottoms are painful or sore, their ulcers should be treated with small ones.
The form of large and small ulcers:
The head of the cannula, on which the bag is tied, should be wide in this way; and there should be a distinction where the bag is tied, just as before.
And the lower end, which is inserted into the bottom, should be completely closed (that is, not open) very narrow, almost subtle; and on one side of it should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays and a little thicker.
And the bag, in which the medicines for the bladder of a beast or sheep's skin are placed, and its bottom should be one palm wide.
And it should be perforated with many holes, as it is rolled; and if the space between the holes is the thickness of the finger.
And then insert into those holes strong, sharp, crude, and strong fiel (likely a type of medicated substance), about ten of them, or thereabouts; and fasten the bag to that.  And when the bag is placed in place, tightly bind the head of the device (cristeri) between two dividers with a firm constriction, and then seal each hole with that (cristeri).  However, the technique of sealing with that is that you fill the bag with medicine, which should be warmed to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is not too hot nor too cold.
Then the patient should lie on their back, raise their legs up, and place a cloth or a sheet under them; then anoint the end of the cautery with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or similar.  Then gently insert this into the anus, and the attendant should grasp the bag and squeeze it with both hands with force until everything within the device has been expelled into the intestines;  then remove the device, and the patient lowers their legs to the floor.
And if the medicine causes that expulsion, keep it in place as long as possible; and if they sleep with it all night, it is more effective in aiding recovery.
However, if you cauterize in cases of bowel looseness and expulsion, you repeat the cautery until healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or festering sores in the anus, then the cautery should be very fine and gentle, like the cauteries used for children.
Of the treatment of plagues.
I have already stated in the division of the treatment of plagues what was appropriate for the book, and I say thus the treatment of those with hands and with medicines, according to the condition.
Therefore I say that plagues are diversified according to how they are caused and according to the location where they appear.
And the causes why plagues are often inflicted are like a stone throw, or a cut from a blade or knife, or a blow from a spear, or a stick, or an arrow, or similar to these, from many causes.
But the plagues that are in the parts of the body are like the plague that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the stomach, or the liver, and similar to these in the limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some plagues, so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with the simple plagues of the head, for the remembrance of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from a thrown stone or similar, and the skull has only been dented and it is a serious injury and you fear the onset of a hot abscess in the patient, then you should quickly perform phlebotomy on the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and draw from it [the vein] according to its strength, if nothing prevents the phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has come out of the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the injured part; and keep the patient from fullness, and from strong drinks and foods.
But if any reason prevents you from diminishing [the phlebotomy], then reduce the patient's food and do not let him approach meat or wine.
And apply to the wound, if a hot abscess has arisen, a poultice of softened oil or wine in which something astringent has been mixed.
But if you are certain of a hot abscess, then apply to the wound, if it is recent, its own blood, and the air has not changed the powder that I will briefly describe below.
And if the air has already altered it, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or caused by a cut or similar injury, and its edges are not brought together by a bandage, then bring them together with sutures, as I will describe in the section on suturing.
But if the wound has already exposed the bone and tendon, and there is not a retention but a small suspension, then cut it and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh gradually in place of the damaged part, and order the patient to eat foods with a thick consistency:  porridge and similar concoctions, until it is restored.
And if you find putrefaction in the damaged tissue and it does not adhere to the bone, then you cut away all the putrid material and discard it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood can flow, and it is not severed by medicines, then you search for the artery, and if you find it unsevered, then you cut it with a spatula, or tie it off; and if necessity compels you to not do as described, then you cauterize it until the bleeding stops.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then the cause of them is slight; therefore you can sprinkle this powder on them, for it will solidify them before the air alters them.
And the method for the powder is this: take one part olive oil, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts of unquenched lime; thoroughly grind and sift them, and fill the wound with the mixture, and bind it firmly until it adheres well to the area, and it is coagulated by the blood.
And then you bind it with dressings and leave it, and do not remove it as long as it is not inflamed, for the medicine will not be effective until it is healed.
And sometimes this works alone, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood present.
And you perform this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary to place it on them and bind them, and on fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially during summer, then this powder is not appropriate; but instead treat them with what we have said, or apply digestive ointments to them, or a poultice of barley flour with water and honey until they form a scab; and afterwards treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if a wound occurs with a fractured bone, and it is small, then you extract this with a poultice.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment, and between the wound of the head when it is simple.
However, if the nerve or artery of the neck is cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy but to avoid treatment with something that causes extreme astringency, such as applying zinc and verdigris (which is vitriol and similar to them), because these hurt the nerves and constrict them. And do not apply any cold thing to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is treated with gentle remedies, such as washing with soft water, sometimes infused in oiled or un-oiled oil, and a poultice when washed with soft water and other softening stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or constrict its edges, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
However, if the wound is deep or has reached the underlying (or deepest) part of the flesh, then pierce it in the most depressed area.
But if an artery has already been cut in the wound and blood is flowing, then separate or cut off that artery, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity prompts you to do so.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or all of them have been cut and the neck veins are saved, then you should bring the edges of the wound together with stitches on the neck bone and do not touch it; first straighten it and bring it back to its natural shape, and then hold it firmly with a suitable bandage, and leave it for several days; and then treat it with ointments containing astringent and stimulating substances until it is healed.
However, if the wound has already affected the bone deeply, then you must treat it.  And if there are bone fragments there, remove as many as you can; and what you are not able to remove, leave it until the wound can fester and the fragments are separated and the discharge from it is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle the powder that has been recommended on it. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with what the remembrance (or recollection) will bring forth in its appropriate chapter.
If the wound is from a spear or knife, and considering its depth,  then consider if there is a windiness when the patient breathes (or the patient is breathing heavily/has labored breathing);  then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is recent with its own blood, then you place on it, from the first hour, powder, and do not press it so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but place an attractive ointment there, and loosen it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available to you, then you place on the wound's opening a piece of old cloth, so that it absorbs whatever humidity is there; and make the patient sleep on the wound, so that what is collected there runs out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and there is no spasm or trembling of the heart or tightening of the lungs, nor other bad conditions of the patient, then know that the wound is saved; and then cure it with poultices and other treatments until it is healed.
But if the healing of it is hindered, and it has remained open for a long time, then know that a fistula has already formed; therefore, treat it according to its specific procedure.
And if the wound is from a cut with a knife or a sword, and is simple on the surface of the foot or the back, then cure it with what precedes suturing, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has already caused damage to the bone, and has already cut pieces out of it, then you should probe the wound and try to remove those pieces, if they are detached. But if they are not detached, then leave them until the wound can close, because their removal is difficult.
And for other wounds that occur on other limbs, the treatment is the same as what we have described.
Of wounds of the abdomen.
The ailment that occurs in the abdomen is either severe, slight, or moderate.
And a small rupture is more difficult to fix in another way, and the reduction of these parts is more difficult if you do not quickly return them to their proper place after the intrusion, for if it opens and swells, the re-insertion becomes difficult.
Therefore, a moderate rupture is the best, for in that case the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two aforementioned types.
And know that suturing of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two sutures are common and suitable for suturing other wounds on the body.
And two other specific sutures are common to other wounds, but are even more specific to abdominal sutures.
And I will explain each one to you with exposition and declaration.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has come out through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either due to the smallness of the rupture, as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is the case, you should warm it by immersing a damp sponge or cloth in lukewarm water alone, or by soaking it in water with squill, cyperus, and spikenard, and apply that to the intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes, this is done in water with astringents, and is better than plain water in resolving the inflammation.
And when you see the inflammation to be resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallows have been boiled, for by this the interior of it is relieved with little trouble.
But if the interior of it is not relieved with this treatment, then cut the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better, when it is proper and does not involve cutting, and there should be no recourse to cutting when there is necessity and weakening.
Of the instrument, see its shape:
One part of it is sharp and pointed, the other part is blunt, the tip is slender, and it is not as slender as a spatula, but rather slightly blunt.
And therefore, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine is outside, then its reduction should be according to its natural form, into its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is wide, and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you raise the head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then constantly direct your attention and consideration to this, so that the part where the wound is is higher than the other.
And thus it is necessary that you administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant hold the rupture entirely with their hand and bring the edges together, and then investigate if there is any other reason for the suture or something else.
And this is the common method of suturing: take a needle, or a set of needles, according to the size of the wound; and then place the end of the rupture on the ring finger, and tighten the needle so that you don't leave slack in the two ends of the suture, with the two ends of the thread underneath the suture of the inner parts, until you penetrate from that side; and you have now joined the two ends of the suture and the two ends of the thread, making four knots.
And then tighten with a double thread around the needle, and sometimes from both sides together, and then close the two edges and the wound with a proper closure; and then leave the thickness of the finger and insert another needle in it, and then tie it with thread just as you tied with the first needle; and do not cease doing this with needles if it is necessary until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And the needles should be of medium thickness between thick and thin, because thin needles easily pierce the flesh; and thick ones are difficult to pass through the suture, and therefore they should be medium in thinness and thickness.
And the needle should not be inserted too close to the two ends of the suture, so that the flesh is not pierced easily and the wound bursts before its consolidation.
And do not extend the sutures so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
And then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not disturb the patient's sleep; and place on the suture expanded powders from all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is already healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most convenient for small wounds, for in their suture one or two or about that number of needles are sufficient.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you join with sutures the four ends, of the suture and the two ends of the bandage, in one go, with a needle which is wrapped evenly in fineness and thickness.
And then, when you have pierced these four ends with the needle, withdraw the needle from the same part from which you began, so that the thread retracts from the most superior part of the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth stitch by which the cloths are tightened.
And place between each stitch the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And with such a suture I healed the wound which had befallen a man in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was more than a palm, and the intestines had protruded about two palms from the middle part, and the rupture was in the middle of the limb; and then I reduced that rupture after the intestines had been outside for 24 hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or so, and I cured him and he is healthy; and afterwards he lived for many years, and he is renowned for his good condition.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be cured; and by miracle it was, for I did not cure him with ointment, for it was in a place where ointment was not found nor any medicine, but I applied a piece of old cloth twice a day and washed it diligently with honey water until it was healed.
But I shall tell you two kinds of sutures proper, according to the account of Paraula.
And it is that you begin with a suture of the thread, and you insert the needle from the outer part to the inner part.
And thus, as the needle pierces the thread and in that same laceration, according to its length and across the entire body, and leaves the end of the thread in which you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside on the other end of the thread.
And when you have made that penetrate, then you make it penetrate again in that same end of the thread from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside.
And make that penetration with your penetration, with which you make that penetrate into the thread at the end of the thread that is on his side, until all of that penetrates.
And then, starting from this same side, stitch it with the end of the thread on the other side, and remove the needle from the thread that penetrated, and then return that to that thread and stitch the end of the thread that is on the other side with this end of the thread; and remove that from the thread that is on his side.
And do that once and again, and do that once, then again, until you stitch everything that is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suturing is that you stitch with a skin-like suture, with which you sew skin, so that you stitch the thread once from the side of the thread's end, and then leave it another time until you have completed it.
However, the second type of suture, properly called the Gaulish suture, and this is as he and by him recounted, is that you sew it according to a similar method with which some medics stitch it, in such a way that they add each part to its corresponding part to him conveniently by nature; and they apply one end of his and the end of the thread to the other end of him, and this is done according to what I have recounted to you.
You should place the needle at the end of the thread near the exterior part, and make it penetrate to the interior in that same place, and leave the two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the exterior to the interior in the two ends of the thread.
And then turn each of those, and make each penetrate from the interior to the exterior in two other ends of the thread that are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common, simple suture, and is the suture of which the previous remedy spoke.
This is the Gaulish method.
And some may say, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles; this means that you insert a thread into each of these, and begin with the insertion of the needle from your side, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who know the skins equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then the suture there is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of the treatment of plague is the judgment of the other plagues.
Which means that when you catch the plague fresh, with its blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestines and stitch it up and prepare it properly, then apply a flesh-forming powder to it.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then apply some ointments which you have on hand until they form a hard stone and the fibers fall out, and be consolidated and observed; then treat it just as you would treat other plagues until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines on hand, then apply immediately, as soon as it begins to cast off pus, a strong poultice, and change it twice a day, as you were taught, until it is healed, for you will not need other treatment in many cases when the plagues are simple.
But if you fear that the plague will spread to the major limbs, then you must soak some linen in oil of tempered quality, or in warmed oil, and place that around the areas between the ribs and under the armpits.
And if he feels pain or putrefaction in his bowels, for this often happens, then cauterize it with black astringent wine, especially if the ulcer has penetrated into the cavity of his bowel and has made a penetrating exit.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is easier to heal than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal, for the intestine called "jejunum" does not receive healing from a plague that settles upon it completely; and this is because of the large multitude of veins within it, and because of its size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what arises from the plague is a membrane, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your technique for reducing the intestines as well.
But if it has spread to the surrounding area and it is already green or black, then you should compress that area with a cloth over the blackened spot, to bring about blood flow, for there are veins and arteries in the membrane.
And then cut what is beside that ligament, and hang the two ends of the cloth over the area below the plague, so that the pull from the affected area towards the joining of the membrane and the emission of the plague's arm is lessened.
A reminder of the plagues when they occur in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small, it is possible for it to be restored in some individuals.  For example, I saw a man who had been injured in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the plague was on the right side of the stomach. The plague was old, and had formed a fistula, and expelled gas and wind.
Then I considered his treatment, though I was not confident in his recovery, but I continued to treat it until it was healed and the area was consolidated.
And after I saw the area healed, I observed the patient for any further abdominal problems.  No further complications arose, and he remained in his usual state of health, eating and drinking, and then bathed and engaged in his activities.
And some experienced individuals have said that when a small intestinal injury occurs, it should be treated in this way: you should take large-headed leeches; then, join the two edges of the wound, and place one of these leeches with an open mouth on the two edges of the wound.  Then, when it has attached itself and closed its mouth, sever the leech’s head, because it adheres and is not released.
Then place another leech near the first, and do not stop doing this with leeches, one after the other, according to the size of the whole wound.
Then reduce the swelling and the wound; and those leech heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm comes to the patient.
And it is possible that the intestine be joined with a thin thread, which is made from the intestine of an animal, joined to it, after it has been put through a needle; and you should take the end of this intestinal thread, and it should be very lean, and then tie that end to the injured intestine, wrapped around it, and then thread that thread through needles and stitch the intestine together, and reduce that into the rupture.
And this method of suturing with leeches is only according to a way of trust and hope.
However, if the wound is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, for then there is no remedy but subtlety, and there is no complete healing of it.
Of the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and has become an ulcer, and is not healed and continues to discharge pus constantly and is not incised, then, in any limb, is universally called a fistula, and we call that an ulcer.
And a fistula, according to truth, is a hardened, tough, whitish knot, with which there is no pain, and which has a cavity just like the cavity of a bird's nest; and therefore we call that an ulcer, called "rized ulcer," or  "nest ulcer.
And in some people it is moist, which discharges pus; and very easily the moisture is incised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and is thin, and is large, and is subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of them, and their treatment with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that I make known to you the treatment of a fistula, which is done by means of surgery with a hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for some fistulas reach the major veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the spinal cord, or the intestines, or the bladder, or to any of the ribs, or to any of the vertebrae of the spine, or to any of the compound joints, such as the wrist and ankle, and others that affect the area close to the main limb and similar locations.
And therefore, those fistulas that are in this manner are among the difficult-to-heal illnesses, and do not receive a cure; and to work on them with ignorance is useless effort.
And if there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these locations that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to gain knowledge of it, then try with a probe or an iron, and if the fistula goes in a straight line, follow it with the probe.
But if the fistula is winding, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, with the lightness of its substance, is easily bent towards the winding path.
And if the fistula has many horrifications, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Then irrigate the orifices through their orifices, for the moisture with which you irrigate it will travel to the other openings and run through them.
And then inquire meticulously, by whatever means you can, to know if there are bones or nerves, and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or close, or whether it is a fistula with many openings, and consider all this with all your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the location of the pain by pressing with your hand on the area, and the meanings and causes of the abscess.
And when you have considered all these factors with true judgment, then proceed to treatment according to your judgment: and you must now consider whether the fistula is a superficial, close, or exposed fistula; or one in a salty area, distant from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places I have told you.
Then dry the fistula as previously described, and remove what is in that filtering process and the corrupted flesh, and what has arisen in the opening of the flesh, or of pus and the like, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is deep and extensive, then it must be incised to the best of your ability, and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh; then apply some bandages of sharp medicines and insert them into the fistula cavity, which you have opened with an iron instrument.
And do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine has corroded all that is rotten in the fistula's cavity.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have described.
However, if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then you should investigate and dry it as we have described, unless you see any reason to avoid affecting a vein, nerve, or major limb, as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness on it, then you must scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something to make it flesh again until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and still discharges pus as before, then know that you have not fully eradicated the corruption; and then you must expose it again carefully, thoroughly scrape and clean it with your strongest tools, and then restore it.
And if it is healed, good; but if not, then know that the corruption is deep within the body, beyond your reach, and in that case, there is no remedy but to leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to remove it, then you should remove it with thin forceps suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then carefully remove all of them, and leave nothing behind with your strength.
But if any moisture causes you difficulty, and there is no fear or mistake in their incision, then cut those ligaments or flesh if there are any, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones immediately, then place something over the wound that might protect it, and leave it until it is surrounded by flesh and ligaments, and keep the wound from healing, so that the incision you made in your operation is contained.
However, if you are concerned, place on it cotton soaked in crushed oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in some other green ointment, because when those ligaments soften, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and extraction will be easier.
But if there is a large bone, like a leg bone or thigh bone or similar, and only the surface is corrupted, then cut that with a rasp until the blackness and corruption are removed, and then restore the wound.
However, if the corrupted portion is large, and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to cut that entire area, cutting into the spot where the corruption has spread, and then treating that until it heals.
And I will tell you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, around 30 years of age, who experienced pain in his thigh, and from the parts within the body, the matter spread until it reached the thigh, and it was a matter of an abscess with a large abscess, and it was not an external cause.
And so the time passed with that, through the doctors' error, until the abscess opened, and a lot of matter escaped, and its cure was delayed until the leg became fistulaed, and many openings appeared in it, which all discharged pus and the body's humors.
Then a multitude of doctors treated him for about two years, and none of them were truly skillful in the art, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those openings, a great deal of it; and the man's entire body was emaciated, and his complexion was yellowish.
Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone.
And I then probed all the openings, and found them to extend to all parts of the leg.
Then I carefully incised one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone, and found it decayed, already earthy and corrupted and blackened; and a part of the leg was already decayed, having penetrated down to the marrow.
Then I closed what I had uncovered and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I concluded that it was not in the bone itself, but that corruption which I had cut away and closed, and I had already cured it.
And then I applied restorative medicine for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I reopened and exposed the bone again, on top of the first exposure, and found continued decay with the bone.
And I removed what seemed to be that decay, and then I was forced to perform the cure and restoration, and it was not restored.
And then I exposed it again, and I did not stop cutting the bone little by little, specifically, and forced its restoration, but it was not restored until I cut around a hand's breadth of it, and extracted that with its marrow, and then I restored it with medicines, and it was slightly consolidated and healed.
And no further repetition of the operation and section is needed except for the weakness of the patient, and due to their little tolerance and fear of death, for in the patient, there occurred at all times a harmful syncope (fainting) due to the excess of evacuation.
Therefore, it is completely healed, and there is no hard, fleshy tissue in place of the bone; and its condition in the body is now good, and its strength has returned; and it has been restored to its original condition, and it experiences no difficulty in walking or harm in any way.
However, if the bone is prominent in a part of the body already fractured, then you must cut it in this way: take a bandage and tightly bind it to the end of the protruding bone, and order someone to pull on it; then place a thicker wool bandage over the first bandage; then bind that over the flesh below the bone, and pull on the end so that you draw the flesh down, and expose the flesh over the place where you wish to cut, so that the cut does not damage the flesh.
And place a stick or board under the bone properly, for when you do this, the cut will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And the incision should be made over the corrupted area little by little, for if the corruption is within the cavity of the bone and does not appear on its surface to the touch, it may need to be incised again.
And if the bone is corrupt but not protruding, with one part still connected to the other, and the corruption is in the middle or a portion of it, then you must uncover all the surrounding flesh; and then place a stick underneath, and then cut from the first part where the corruption is until the cut continues to the other part.
And let the incision be made along the location of the corruption, a little at a time, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is connected to the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then it is not in a rational place but is unnatural.
And if the corruption is in the flesh of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the corruption in whatever manner appears to you, and expose it, and clean it according to any possible disposition, and with whatever ingenuity is available to you, so long as it does not impede or injure a vein or nerve.
And know that the incisions and saws used to cut these bones are very much dependent on the location of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety and size, and their hardness and rarity. Therefore, you must prepare suitable instruments for every type of operation.
And understand that this operation demands knowledge of the specific instruments you will need; for great study, long experience, and understanding of the methods of this art, and experience with illnesses, are necessary, so that you yourself know what instruments are appropriate for every illness.
And I am now providing you, at the end of this chapter, a list of the instruments you will use, along with simple instructions, to perform the procedures that you will then test on others. Shape/form of saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of another large saw:
Shape of a ray (or: ray's form). Let the head of this ray be shaped like a star-shaped keyhead, and its points be shaped like those of a starburst.
And it is not fitting except that with that [the ray/star shape] the heads of the joints are cauterized when they are corrupted, or if the opening is large and wide.
Shape of a smaller razor.
Shape of a side/lateral razor.
The shape of another properly made saw:  a bow should be made of the strongest material and its sharpness of iron, and its handle of well-made wood. Shape of it (the saw).
Shape of a razor that has a concavity/curvature.
Another subtle/delicate shape of a razor.
Shape of another razor with a curved end.
Shape of a small razor resembling a tentacle.
Shape of another, smaller cutting tool.
Shape of another cutting tool; this one resembling a ray, and its end is like a saw, and it is shown in many places in the treatise on bones.
Shape of a ray that is appropriate for the study of bones that have been perforated.
And its tip is triangular and sharp-pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, all the things we have said about razors, cutting tools, and saws should be.
Of the cutting edges and the saw-like aspects of the bones.
The extremities [of the affected area] may be damaged either due to intrinsic or extrinsic causes, or if your treatment with these medications does not resolve the corruption, or if the corruption spreads to a limb that wasn't initially affected, then you must make incisions into that limb wherever the corruption has reached, so that the patient escapes death or a greater deterioration of the limb.
And the sign of the affected area is that the limb becomes black, as if fire had burned it, or the blackness spreads until the hardness reaches the limb and engulfs the whole body; then, operate with an incision on that area.
And similarly, if the corruption is caused by the sting of venomous creatures, such as a scorpion, viper, or other similar creatures.
And if the corruption or injury is in the extremity of the finger, then you should incise the finger and prevent the corruption from spreading to the hand.
And similarly, if the affliction reaches the hand, then you should make an incision at the base of the forearm, and prevent the corruption from spreading to the arm's socket.
And if that fails, then you should make an incision in the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond the elbow, then death for the patient is certain; and to administer any other remedy for this is a futile act.
And similarly, for the foot, when corruption reaches the toe, then you should incise it up to one of the joints.
And if it spreads to the sole of the foot, then you should incise the entire foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you should incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy but to allow the patient to die.
And the method of incising or cutting the limb is that you should tighten the ligament in the area just below the part you want to cut, and tighten another ligament on the spot; and let the assistant pull a ligament downwards, and let another assistant pull a ligament upwards; and you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, holding it apart with a spatula until all the flesh is exposed; and then cut or sever it.
And it is necessary that a cloth be placed on all sides so that the area is not touched, and that the patient experiences a controlled, contained wound and abscess.
But if you encounter a flow of blood during the operation, then you should cauterize the bleeding spot carefully, or place some blood-stopping powders on it; and then return to your procedure until it is finished.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I relate to you what happened to a man on his foot, the same accident that I am relating to you, which is that he suffered a blackening on his foot, with a burn similar to a fire burn.
And that corruption began first in his toe until it spread to his entire foot.
And then the man himself, seeing the treatment was not reaching the limb with the intensity he needed because of the pain and the burning, incised the foot right up to the joint, and it healed.
For a long time, the same corruption happened to him on the tip of his index finger.
And then he came to me, and I was forced to counteract that excess with what I could apply to his hand from among the medicines, to purify his body; but the excess was not counteracted, and it began to spread to the other fingers until it spread to his whole hand.
And he urged me to cut his hand, but I did not want to do that, hoping for a counteraction of that excess, and more than fearing the death of his hand due to the incision, for the patient's strength was wavering.
And after he left me, he returned to his own land, and it came to me that this man had prepared himself and cut his entire hand, and it healed.
And I have not related this story except so that it may be helpful in understanding this illness, and that it may be a sign by which it may be recognized and according to which it may be treated.
Of the treatment of sinuses and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
When an abscess develops on a fleshy part of the body and the abscess cavity extends to collect pus, and it then bursts and is opened, and the pus comes out, leaving a hollow space like a vessel, and the skin covering it is thin, and has not progressed to further decay, and does not affect the bone, nerves, or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and not a fistula.
However, if the cavity extends so that the decay affects any part of the body, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the treatment of it is to cut away that skin completely, as it is turned back, and especially when it is thin and like a cloth, and to make sure that it does not adhere to the area because of its decay.
But if you suspect that the skin is adhering and that the decay has not yet spread further, and there is a wound on the skin, then you treat it with a clyster.
And if you consider it a sinus, and if it is large, and the discharge has a foul odor, then administer a clyster with Egyptian medicine, which is made of oil, sour wine, and vinegar in equal parts, mixed in a vessel, heated over a fire until the medicine becomes thick and resembles honey.
Then take what is necessary from it and dissolve it with water and honey; and administer this mixture as a clyster to the sinus, and tighten the opening, and leave the medicine there for two hours.
And then remove it with a compress; and do this for so many days until the sinus is cleansed and the odor is gone.
And sometimes, if this medicine isn't available, it's administered with water mixed with ashes.  Take the ashes from a fire, mix them with water, then strain it and administer this as a clyster until you are confident that the sinus is closed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then administer a clyster with water and honey, and some crushed vinegar mixed in, or a clyster with wine and honey mixed together, for honey's property is to cleanse and wash, and wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are confident that the sinus is healed, then administer a clyster with something that promotes the growth of flesh there.
And you should take diafinicon ointment, dissolve it in warmed oil and astringent wine; or administer a clyster with other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, preventing the clyster tube from entering, then widen it gradually with a small iron tool, and apply heat wrapped in Egyptian or Basil ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should bring the lips of the wound together with stitches and leave them in a manner that allows the clyster tube to enter without difficulty.
And if the opening through which the fistula runs is elevated to the upper parts, then close it in the lowest area and allow the fistula to run downwards, for when the fistula is located deep within the sinus, the flesh will grow there.
And if you cannot close the sinus down to the lower bone as desired, then force yourself to prepare the limb with a preparation so that the fistula runs easily as you have prepared, and so that no cause of the fistula is retained within it.
But the one over the sinus opening, which remains at all times, so that what is accumulating within the fistula may exit. And so that you may know if the discharge from the fistula is copious or scant, or if it is digested or not.
And by this, consider the location of the sinus; if the patient feels pain there, and if an abscess is present.
And as your treatment extends in this way, and you see the matter that has collected over the sinus opening has adhered or is showing signs of adhesion, then, on the third day, detach it, and when you detach the scab, change the cloth and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus a subtle, spreading virus has emerged, then do not despair of the adhesion, for healing in such cases tends to take time, as there are some people in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and others in whom the opposite is true.
And if from the sinus for many days undigested matter has emerged, then know that the sinus has not adhered; and if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and the cause prolonged, then you should adjust the drying effects of the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, dry them like *unguentum diafinicon*, when the superfluous addition of pitch is adjusted to it.
And the final remedy with which it is cured is to take *unguentum diafinicon*, dissolve it in warmed oil, and add ancient wine to it, which is thickened in its substance, and mix this together thoroughly, and use this remedy.
And similarly, in the absence of matter, use *unguentum diafinicon*, honey when it is heated until it is thickened, and apply this; or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, grind them all into powder over honey that has been heated on the fire, then spread this on a cloth and apply the cloth to the sinus; and apply the honey, which you have heated until thickened, and sprinkled over a cloth, and press it against the sinus.
Sometimes, aristolochia longa, roots of the lily of the valley (and it is the lily of the valley), and the flour of eryngo and centaury are administered with it.  Grind and sift these herbs into powder over the honey, as previously mentioned; and use that.
And if the sinus is prolonged and not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the bone beneath it, or in other hard members or ligaments.  Then treat it with fistulous treatment, as was described above.
Of the treatment of felon (panaricium), and of the injured or damaged nail, and of the incision of the afflicted finger, and of the section.
A felon (panaricium) is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of the finger of the hand or foot, and it often arises on other fingers.  When it is prolonged and its treatment is less successful, or is an abscess of a severe abscess, or is corrupt, and it sheds matter until it rots the roots of the nail, and often corrupts the entire nail, and often spreads its corruption to the bone until it produces a foul odor, and the end of the finger becomes discolored and dark.
And therefore, when you have done as we have said in the division and your treatment does not succeed, then you must cut away all the excess matter that remains from the nail with a knife, and then cauterize the wound with it, for cautery is very helpful in this.
However, if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the nail bed has already begun to compress the flesh in the affected area, and begins to pierce and irritate the area, then you should place a fine blade under the nail's edge where it is piercing the flesh, and lift that flesh and cut it easily.  Apply burning and corrosive medicines to what remains of the flesh until it is all removed; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then you must cut into the bone and remove it, for a bone that is corrupted will never heal.
And if the corruption and decay spread to the finger, then you should cut into it at one of its joints, according to how its recovery is expected, and then treat it until healed.
But if the nail has suffered a blow or abrasion, and there is intense pain, then you should initially perform bloodletting on the patient, and then carefully cut the nail with a sharp blade in a transverse cut from top to bottom, being careful not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause the patient intense pain, and cause a buildup of excess flesh in that area.  Then treat that area with whatever remedies alleviate pain.
But a swollen finger, which is often found in some men's hands, is easily swollen in the flesh, and easily swollen in the bone, or easily swollen in the nail.
And some of these swellings are born at the joint, or their origin is in certain joints of the fingers. But the one that is born in certain joints of the finger is not harmful, and the one that is born in the joints is easily inflamed.
And for those that are fleshy swellings, the incision is gentle, and you should cut it away from its base with a broad blade.
But for the one that is born at the base of the joint, the cure is difficult; therefore, be careful of severing it.
But for the one that is born on the finger near the joints, you should initially cut the flesh around it in a circular incision to the bone, and then trim it with one of the suitable saws for this, and then treat it until it heals.
However, if the fingers become fused together – either naturally or due to a birth defect, a plague, a burn, or similar causes – then it is necessary to sever that fusion until the fingers return to their natural shape.
And then place between them strips of cloth soaked in heated oil, so that they do not fuse together prematurely, and separate them, or place a thin sheet of lead between them until they are healed properly.
And similarly, if a fusion occurs between a finger and the palm, then sever that fusion as the preparation and shape of the limb requires.
Of incisions of veins, they are varicose veins.
Veins are varicose veins, and are thick veins filled with melancholic excess fluids that accumulate in various parts of the body, and predominantly in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Therefore, you should administer purgation of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.
However, their treatment with iron is in two ways: one is that the veins are incised and that black blood is drawn out, and the other way is that the vein is raised and the whole thing extracted.
The section of it is done in this manner: First, soak the leg in very hot water until the thick, feculent blood in the leg is dissolved, then tightly bind the patient's leg from the highest part of the thigh down to the groin with a bandage.  Then cut the vein at one, two, or three places with a wide incision.  Next, raise the black blood with your hand from the bottom of the leg upward, and downward to upward, until the desired amount of blood has been drawn and the patient's condition is relieved.
And then bandage it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are filled and this benefits the patient.
But their elevation is performed in this manner: you are to lift the patient's leg, if it is very swollen, and then immerse it in a bath and soak the leg in hot water until it turns red and the veins are enlarged; or, if a bath is not available, to be exercised vigorously until the limb is warmed.
Then cut the cord directly over the vein by incision, along the back of the leg below the groin, or at the lowest part of the leg below the ankle.
Then open the cord with hooks and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears sensitive, and it is at the point where you see the red turning to black.
And then, as you open it, from the cord you see that white which is the string.
Then place a reed under it so that it is raised and separated from the cord, and suspend it with a hook or forceps.
Then make another incision near that one, three days later, and then scrape the cord from the part above the vein until it appears.
Then raise that, and cut it in a second incision towards the heel, and then pull that out and raise it until it comes out through the second incision, and then pull it out of the incision above it.
Do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until everything is out; and then cut it.
And if you are unable to extract and elevate it, then insert a needle with a strong double hook and tie it and pull it out, or insert a reed underneath it and move your hand around in all directions until it is thrown out. Be careful not to cut it; for if it is broken, it is very difficult for you to elevate it, and it has become a problem for the patient due to that damage.
And when you have entirely expelled it, then place on the affected area wool soaked in wine and rubbed oil and un-rubbed oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having a tortuosity to which it is wrapped in parts, and is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary that you cut along every part of its tortuosity and at the places where it is wrapped, and then suspend it with hooks until you have lifted the whole thing.
And be careful in your incision not to cut the vein and not to damage it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your prudence in this.
Form of the incision with which a vein is cut:
It is not sharp like hooks, nor has a sharp tip so that it does not damage the vein; and it is of considerable flexibility, like a lion's paw, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein because of its thinness; however, it has a superfluous thickness as we said.
Of the extraction of a vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, just like in the lands of the Arabs, and in the hot and arid lands of India, where little vegetation grows, and neither grass nor trees flourish.
And it is easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction arising from beneath the skin, like snakes, worms, and maggots that breed between the skin and flesh.
And a sign of the onset of this vein is a vehement inflammation in the leg; then the area becomes blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the area of that blister, as if it were a plant's root.
And then, when its extremity appears, you should wrap a lead weight around it, which should be the weight of a drachma.  Up to two drachmas, and bind it and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as any cause of this is outside the parts, wrap that in lead and bind it. And if it is prolonged, then you should incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise that part until it has fully emerged, for if you incise it while it is still inside, it will retract into the flesh, causing an abscess and possibly a foul ulceration in that area.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is completely expelled from behind it and no part of it remains inside the body.
And from this vein, some men have had it grow to a length of five palms and ten fingers, and it has come to my attention that one has grown to twenty palms in length.
And if it is incised during treatment, then insert the probe into its opening and penetrate it with a long probe, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer treatment for the putrefaction of the area for several days with medicines; then treat it like a festering wound.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot, and has many openings, and a branch emerges from each opening.
Therefore, treat it in the same way as we have said in the division and with the things previously mentioned.
Of the sectioning of worms generated under the skin, and it is called the bovine disease.
This illness is called "bovine disease" in some lands near us, because often it affects cattle.  It's a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh, and it travels throughout the body, moving up and down, and its presence is felt as it moves from limb to limb until it breaks through the skin and emerges.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms, snakes, and other intestinal worms (lombrics and ascarids) are formed within the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it travels through the body and ascends to the head, and reaches the eye, it often causes severe inflammation there and enters, destroying the eye.
And therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, it is only done by following its movement and appearance as felt, and then you must tightly bind and constrict both what is above it and below it, and then carefully cut around it and extract it.
And if it is hidden within the flesh and you cannot find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the area until it dies.  The most feared consequence is the corruption it causes, which corrupts the area, as we have said.
And if you see this creature near the head, close to the eye, then bind tightly around the eyebrow, and then cut around it and extract it.  The patient should use medicines that evacuate bad, putrid humors from the body, and should avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
Of the section on the illness of the nafir.
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is pain that comes upon certain limbs, and it then moves from limb to limb.
And I have already seen that, as I have told you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I examined her arm and saw a small swelling in the vein near the arm's joint.  After remaining there for an hour, I saw this swelling move like a worm climbing up it, but more quickly than it would seem possible, as if it were living silver moving from place to place.
And then the pain went to that place and settled in the muscle, and there it stayed for an hour.
And then it moved to the other arm until it reached the other arm.
And then it continued to move throughout her entire body as I watched; and I was very amazed by its movement and the speed with which it traveled from one limb to another. And I had previously seen this sort of thing with my own eyes, but I have seen many cases where pain travels from limb to limb. But I did not see this with my own eyes like this in a woman.
And I did not think it was anything else, but rather because the woman was old, with dry body and exposed veins, and in this way the wind-like movement appeared to the senses.
And it is necessary that this sort of retro-healing not appear in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
And if you want to cure them, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not immediately apparent to the eye as we have said, so you should gently and slightly press on the area until that constricted wind-like movement is released, and then cauterize the location.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then you should treat it with remedies for the body and with things that expel wind, and cure it with smelly pills and pills of Serapion and the like.
Of the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their types and the parts of the body they strike, for their diversity is that some have large points, and small ones, and concave, and blunt ones, that is, solid ones; and some have three angles, and some have tongues; and some have wings.
And the signs of the brain when an arrow strikes it, and pierces the bone, and emerges from the skull, which is over the brain, are sudden violent pain, and dizziness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of thought, and vomiting of bile, and a strong voice is cut off and the voice is lost, and a white moisture like dust comes out of the wound, and the surrounding area looks like the flesh is becoming liquid.
Therefore, if you see these signs, then you refrain from treating and extracting the arrow, unless it is out in the open.
But the signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is near the left breast, are that the arrow is stuck in a hard, solid substance, and not in an empty space; and the arrow's movement is strongly similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and the extremities become cold, and cold sweat breaks out, and syncope occurs; therefore, know that death is imminent without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are the coming forth of frothy blood from the wound, and the blood vessels near the neck become inflamed, and the patient's complexion changes, and they breathe heavily, and crave a cold breath.
And if the arrow strikes the membrane in the foot, the pain then is near the small ribs, and the breath becomes heavy with intense pain and sighing, and all the muscles of the limbs are not working properly.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then easily some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen, and is embedded there, there is some kind of rupture from the wound, either of the tissue, or of the intestines, which is torn, and there is no hope for the treatment or removal of the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine is coming out of the wound, and there is some cause for this discharge from the outside, and severe pain affects the patient, then know that it is fatal.
However, the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders, arms, spinal column, collarbone, hip, leg, and similar body parts, are saved according to the best possible outcomes if the arrow does not hit a vein or artery, and if the arrow is not poisoned.
And I recount this to you, what I have seen concerning these arrows, so that you can understand this for your own treatment.
This happened because an arrow struck a man in the lacrimal duct of his eye near the root of his nose, and I extracted it from the other side, below the ear, and he recovered, and no harm resulted to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the bone of his eye, below the lower eyelid.  The arrow had already sunk in, and only a small part of it could be retrieved, attached to the shaft. It was a large, sharp arrow of the kind used by the Turks, with a lion's head on the tip, and no barb.
And the Jew recovered, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man, which had lodged in his throat. It was an Arabic arrow, having a barb.  It had become embedded in his throat. I carefully cut around it and then extracted it.  The Christian man recovered.
And I extracted another arrow from a man, which had lodged in his stomach.  I thought he would die from it.  However, after thirty days and no change in his condition, I cut around the arrow and carefully worked it out. He recovered, and suffered no further harm.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had lodged in his back, and the wound had healed over.  But after approximately seven years, the arrow emerged from the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow lodged in her belly. The wound healed over, and there was no change in her condition. The woman suffered no ill effects on her natural bodily functions.
And I saw another man in whose face an arrow lodged, and the wound healed over, yet the arrow remained.  Finding little pain, there were many similar cases.
I extracted the arrow from the king's prince's man that had lodged in the middle of his nose, and it had already moved slightly to the right side.  The entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him shortly after the arrow struck, within three days.
And then I found the arrow's wound very tight; and then I probed it with a fine instrument, and felt nothing; but he felt a prick below the right ear.  And then I suspected that this prick was from the arrowhead.
And I applied a plaster with attractive and digestive properties to the area, confident that the area would become inflamed so that the arrow's position would be revealed, so it would dry up around it.
And no significant incident occurred in the area, that the arrow had reached that spot; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days, and no accident occurred; and the wound healed meanwhile, and the patient remained free from the effects of the extraction for many days, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and told me about it.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened, and with the probe I examined it, and found the thin arrowhead, which was stuck to the shaft.
And then I continued applying the corrosive medicine to the wound, until the arrowhead became clearly visible to me, and I spent time with this for a period of about four months.
And then, since the wound had enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and it remained unyielding, I continued to use various ingenious methods until one day I used a set of skillfully crafted forceps, as the description of these will come at the end of the chapter, to extract it; and then I healed the wound.
Some doctors thought that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound healed completely. The patient was healthy and sound, and suffered no further ill effects.
I recount to you the method of extracting some arrows, so that you may understand and recognize the significance of what I have said, because the parts of this art and the definitions of it are not grasped with narration, nor do they completely fill the book.
A skillful craftsman compares little things to great; and present things to absent things; and finds new operations and new instruments to address the removal of foreign objects when accidents occur.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not driven out of the limbs into which they are lodged except in two ways: either by pulling on the place where they entered, or by the opposite pulling on the other part.
And that which is driven out through the place where it entered, or is an arrow lodged in fleshy tissue, is pulled and driven out.
And if you do not follow this procedure at the time of extraction, then it is necessary to leave it for a few days, so that the surrounding flesh can heal, and the pull on the arrow and its exit are eased.
And similarly, if it is lodged in bone and you do not follow this procedure, then leave it for a few days and repeat the pulling and movement each day, and it will be driven out.
And if you do not follow the procedure for a few days, then you must pierce the area surrounding the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine instrument until the space around the arrow is enlarged, and then remove it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body, and is hidden from sight, then you probe for it with a tool, and if you feel it, then you extract it with instruments suitable for its removal.
And if you cannot reach it because of the constriction of the wound and the length of the shaft, and this is not over a bone, nerve, or vein, then you make the wound larger until it is widened and the arrow can be extracted.
And if it is grasped by the ears with which it is held, then you carefully separate the flesh in which it is lodged from all sides with all the skill you can muster; and work on it, if you cannot release the flesh from the fracture of the ears and their twisting until you succeed.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then you use twisting motions of your hand with forceps on all sides until you make it submit; and with delicate subtlety, ensure that the arrow is not broken, and that its extraction is made as easy as possible for you and for the patient.
And if you cannot remove it immediately, then you leave it for several days until the surrounding tissues heal, and then attempt extraction again, when it is less painful. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then apply the treatments described in the relevant chapter of this text.
And be mindful of the risk of cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and apply your skill in every possible way to remove the arrow; do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, just as I have described and instructed you.
And therefore, position the arrow to counteract the direction the arrowhead was originally lodged in the patient, as this is more beneficial. But if that is not possible, then apply whatever methods are possible, given the circumstances.
However, if the arrowheads are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part of the arrow is already outside the body, or if the arrowhead bends away from the closest bone's surface and often even projects outward; then, make the incision over that; and let the incision be to the extent required by the forceps; and then pull it out, as it is now made loose by this procedure.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrowhead bites into the bone, expands, and then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is also in there, then you push it out with it.
However, if the shaft has fallen down and you want to administer a push, then you insert it, if it is blunt, with a hollow instrument so that its hollow part enters the arrow's groove, and then push it out with it.
But if the arrow is concave, then you push it out with a strong instrument inserted into it, because the arrow is eased by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cut out all the flesh in which the poison is, if possible, and then treat it with whatever is appropriate.
And if the arrow lodges in the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and is close enough so that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then cut around it, and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and pull it out, and then dress the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
Method/design of forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Their ends should be like the beak of a bird, shaped like a saw, so that they grip the arrow and do not let go.
And of those [forceps] there are many varieties, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its thinness, and the size of the wound and the constriction [of the wound].
So that the shaft is easily inserted into the concave arrow and pushed with it.
Of bloodletting from the veins.
The veins for bloodletting, of which thirty are customary to bleed, of which are in chapter sixteen, are two pulsating veins near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two herbs that are on the two apparent temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of two eyes which are called *aspicientz*; and the vein located in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the end of the nose; and two veins that are at the neck; and two veins that are on the upper lip; and two veins that are on the lower lip; and – these are the veins called *algelic* –; and are two veins beneath the tongue. However, the veins that are bled in the arms are five; one of which is the *cephalica*, and it is beside the wild vine; and the people call it "the vein of the head," and it is blunt, and it is a median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the *basilica*, and another branch of the *cephalica*; and the people call that "the vein of the whole body," and the *basilica* is the vein that is placed on the domestic vine, and it is called " *citillar*," and the common people call that "the vein of the belly"; and the *funis* of the arm, and it is placed on the humerus, and it is the one that is bled, and it is the one that appears on the skin by obvious appearance; and *salvatella*, and it is the vein that is between the aforementioned auricular and the smallest finger, and is in two branches.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of them is below the bend of the knee on the wild vine; and the second is *sophena*, and its location is below the leg on the domestic vine; and the *sciatica* vein, and its location is below the leg on the wild vine; and in the leg are other veins similar to those.
The benefit of the veins near the ears is for headaches, migraines, fevers, and bad sores on the head.
And the method of bleeding those veins, as I recommend to you, is to shave the patient's head, and rub the patient's head on the back of the head in the location of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then gently press the patient's neck with a bandage until the two veins appear and their locations are near the ears in two depressions on the head; and feel for them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those with your finger, then bleed them with a lancet.
Then take the lancet knife, which is the one that is sharp, and then insert it below the vein into the groove until the bleeding reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and the groove to the upper parts and cut the vein with a sharp incision. And the length of the incision should be the amount of two fingers joined together or thereabouts; and let out as much blood as you wish.
And then press with pads and leave it until it is healed.
And already, at the beginning of the book, the incision of those and their cauterization have been discussed.
However, for the two arterial veins that are in the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for ancient migraines and persistent bad headaches, and for persistent eye inflammations and a flow of acute excesses poured out into the eyes.
And the method of performing phlebotomy on those veins is as I recommend to you: constrain the patient's neck until the two veins are clearly visible and the pulse of those beneath your finger is apparent; and then you cut with a lancet.
And then you raise the skin over the vein on the upper parts with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy instrument underneath, and lift the vein upwards; and cut it just as you did the other two veins; and allow the blood to flow according to your need.
And then loosen the patient's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then apply a compress and powders and hold that area tightly, and leave it until it is healed.
And already the remembrance of them, and of those incisions and extractions, is presented at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead is useful for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in chronic facial diseases, migraines, stiffness, and foul-smelling ulcers.
And the procedure for phlebotomy is as I recommend to you; that is, the patient should tie their head with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument called a "fossor" (or "excavator"), which is of this form:
Place the pointed end of the fossor onto that vein, and press on it with a hammer or a similar tool, in the manner described; and allow the blood to flow according to the amount you desire; then loosen the patient's constriction and hold it until it heals.
And sometimes a lateral incision is made by phlebotomy, but the phlebotomy should not be with a sharp point like other phlebotomies; rather, with a broad point, and make the phlebotomy across the vein, since the bone is close and strong, and the phlebotomy would break it if it is too thin.
However, the treatment of the two veins that are near the tear ducts is useful for eye scabies, eye stiffness, and inflammation in the eyes, and for facial ailments.
And the procedure for phlebotomy is that the patient should tie their neck with a bandage, then perform the phlebotomy, and you should be standing over their head.
And the phlebotomy should be made across the vein, a little lengthwise with a shallow cut, since there is no muscle in the area; and if the phlebotomy is too thin, the vein's edge is easily broken.
And then let the blood flow as much as you need, and place a cloth over it, and tie it for a night, and then untie it.
But phlebotomy of the nasal vein is useful for acute fevers, severe headaches, facial ailments, migraines, and inflammation that appears on the face, especially when it is long-standing.
And the method for nasal phlebotomy is that the patient should tie their neck, then hold their nose with your left hand, and take a thin lancet, and place it in the middle of the nose's bridge in a straight line, because the vein isn't perceptible there, and because the blood will immediately begin to flow.
You should gently use the small lancet to draw the blood as needed; and then tie it for a night, for it heals quickly.
However, the relief from phlebotomy of both [arms/sides] is helpful for chest tightness, the onset of leprosy, many illnesses, impetigo, and badly corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the method for phlebotomy of those [arms/sides] is that the patient should tie each arm to their neck with a bandage; and the artisan should be positioned above the patient's head, and the patient should lie down on a bed.
Then, slowly lance the vein lengthwise with a wide lancet; and then draw blood in a moderate amount, or according to the perceived need; and then do the same to the other vein.
Then untie the bandage and gently compress the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning, for the wound will heal.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the veins of the face/head helps with small abscesses and pustules of the mouth and gum decay, and bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are on the nose and around it.
And the method for phlebotomy of those [areas] is to have the patient sit before you, and tie their neck with a bandage, and then pull back their lips and look for two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left; and the location of each is shown by the darkness/blackness of each of them, and also because there are small black veins around them; and then cut each one with a skillful incision.
But if you have doubts, and do not know which is which, then proceed to the incision of the largest and most obvious of them.
And do the same for the two veins that are on the upper lips.
However, for two veins below the tongue, the recommended phlebotomy is for issues in the throat (or upper neck area), for uvula ailments, and for mouth ailments.
And the technique for phlebotomizing those veins is to have the patient lie between your hands facing the sun, elevate their tongue, and look beneath it; one vein will be on one side and one on the other, and the color of each is tending toward blackness.
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to continue your incision on those veins, for under them are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those that are commonly found in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways, either using a pointed or olive-shaped lancet with a gradually decreasing sharpness; or cutting with a knife-like lancet, called a *scalpel*, and this is its method:
Its [the lancet's] cut should be as it is, and it is appropriate for opening concave veins, full of apparent thick blood, and those that contain thick, clotted blood.
And this phlebotomy is of smaller width and a more delicate tip, and is suitable for phlebotomies of thin veins containing thin, citrus-colored blood.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it draws blood from illnesses affecting the area below the throat and neck, and from ailments affecting the feet and abdomen.
And it is appropriate for the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy on that vein, to pay close attention and be very cautious, for there is an artery beneath it; and if he errs and misdirects the phlebotomy puncture, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood.  Therefore, it is necessary not to puncture that vein with a pointed lancet, but rather to make a cutting incision with a lancet like a scalpel.
And if the basilic vein is not clearly visible, then it is necessary that you leave it and move to another, or that you seek one of its branches; or that you perform phlebotomy on the area at the end of the arm, for that is evident; and cut it with a scalpel-like lancet, as we have said.
However, if you wish to perform phlebotomy on the same vein, then before tightening the arm, you must feel the area until you find the location of the pulse, and then gently press on it.  Then, bind the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision using a scalpel-like lancet, as we have said.  Take care that the pressure is applied away from any area near the artery.
And when you, while tightening the binding, see swelling in the location you have marked with your finger, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and thus avoid it.
And if you see blood flowing during the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and reddish, then know that it is blood from the artery.  Then you should quickly place your finger over it for a while; then remove your finger, and if the blood has stopped, as is often the case, then you should tighten the arm and leave it alone.
And watch the patient carefully, and be concerned about them and do not let them move for a few days until they are healed.
But if the blood does not stop, and you see that you have no suitable medicine for this, then you should cut the artery, if it seems appropriate to you; for the extremity is constricted, and the blood is stopped. Or, you should take a fig's bark, crush it, and take half of it, and apply it to the site of the vein with a tight binding and powder, until the next day.
And if the blood has stopped, good.  But if not, then treat it with whatever previously stopped the bleeding at the site of the powder used to stop the blood flow.
Stopping the blood flow is difficult in many situations due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of the arm being bandaged.
However, in the case of the *vena fusca* (a dark vein), a phlebotomy is helpful in extracting blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilica and cephalic veins, as we have said.
And the phlebotomist should be very cautious in performing this phlebotomy, because underneath is a nerve; and if in puncturing the vein, the phlebotomist hits the nerve, this will cause the patient numbness, and its cure will be difficult, and often it may not be completely healed.  This nerve is often noticeable; however, if it is hidden from some people and is subtle and not apparent, then you should use the phlebotomy tool with a cutting edge of polished steel and avoid the nerve with skill and force.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and relieves ailments of the eyes.
And in this case, if you wish to perform the phlebotomy, you should use either an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped lancet; for it is the safest of all veins, because there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it.
However, sometimes a boil is quite easily formed in some people when it is not lanced on the first attempt, but it will not affect anything with that boil.
The first thing to know is that phlebotomy is administered for the preservation of health and with hope and caution regarding illness, and that it should be performed on one of the veins in the arm, namely: cephalic, basilic, and median cubital; and that it should be performed in the beginning of spring, after fasting in spring and autumn, and in winter, approximately after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the third day or at the earliest after three hours have passed.
However, phlebotomy should only be administered when there is necessity and appropriateness for it, whether night or day, at all times and in all circumstances.
And it is appropriate that a child not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be bled until the fourth month to the seventh, and the elderly who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
And if someone wishes to be bled, regardless of the reason, they must cleanse their bowels beforehand with a clyster of leeks, if they have much retained stool, so that the veins do not draw the impurities from the bowels into the blood during the phlebotomy, which are putrid, and that they do not harm the main members of the body.
And those suffering from nausea, vomiting, or a hangover, nor those recovering from illness or drunkenness, should not be bled until this has subsided, nor patients with dropsy.  Furthermore, phlebotomy should be avoided during colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, hard work, or strenuous exercise, fasting, or vigils, and any other cause that weakens the body's strength, whether physical or mental.
And beforehand, consider the excess of humors, whether the blood is thick, from their diet and drinks, and with appropriate medications if possible.
And if no reason prevents it, one should enter a bath, or engage in some exercise, so that the blood may be thinned.
And perform the phlebotomy on the patient in the morning, approximately at the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all negative animalistic influences, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all physical stressors, such as excessive work, hardship, sexual activity, and similar afflictions.
And at the bedside, have present the remedies for which there is a common practice among men involving aromatics, scents, balms, and similar substances, according to the possibilities.
And have the phlebotomist sit on a cushion higher than the cushion on which the person to be bled is sitting.
And then pull the patient's arm out, and the phlebotomist should rub it with their hand two or three times; and then bind the limb with a strap, wrapping it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is not enough, or the constriction is excessive, then you should prohibit the flow of blood; or it is with softening, and then you should prohibit the blood's course altogether.
And now, the person to be bled should rub their hands together until the veins become swollen and clearly visible.
And then the phlebotomist should anoint their lancet with a little old oil; and then place their left index finger over the vein, below the intended lancing site, to make the vein slightly bulge, and to stop the percussion, for of the veins, the one that you find in this way is like a rope fleeing from the lancing, and of those is full of air, and when you place the lancet on it, it contracts towards the lancing, and the phlebotomist is deceived; and the lancet does not open the vein, and if it does, that one is constricted.
Therefore, for this, the phlebotomist must be careful and diligent in all these matters.
And then, apply the lancet again, but if the vein is opened in one go, that is good; and if not, you repeat this another time below that spot a little, or above it with haste, if the spot is not inflamed.
And if the spot is inflamed, or the patient is frightened, then you leave it for a day or two, and do not constrict the bandage, for a strong pull will draw a hot abscess, nor should they enter a bath.
And then repeat the phlebotomy if needed.
And if the opening is small and blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will come out as desired, then you repeat the phlebotomy in that same spot, gently adjusting the opening a little, and do this quickly before the area becomes inflamed, for the area becomes inflamed in many people with a small opening.
But if that area is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it serves no useful purpose; and place a little piece of oiled cloth over it, for it will ease the flow of blood. And oil is better in this case than other oils.
And similarly, apply oiled cloths to all phlebotomies, with which you lance the veins to restrain the flow of blood.  Oiled cloths, such as those made from theriac, alhedo, or sagena,  when placed over the area, make the blood thinner and smoother when it is thick.
And if a large abscess forms at the site of the phlebotomy, which often happens, especially in someone who hasn't been bled before or in a vein with a small opening, then you must apply a compress, placing a sponge soaked in warm salt water over the area, and hold it there for an hour;  this will dissolve the inflammation.
And this should be done near the point where blood is leaving the vein,  with support from that or another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the area for several days, do not worry about it.  If you wish, apply something containing aloes and myrrh dissolved, or something like mint juice or balm, or similar.
Often, abscesses and swellings result from phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And therefore, place your hand on it.  If you then find softness under your pressure, the swelling is bad and harmful;  then be careful to apply something like what we have mentioned, because blood will easily flow from the artery.
Make a poultice with something that has astringent properties, so that the area hardens, and then treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
And it is necessary to draw blood from each person according to their constitution and according to the colour of the blood that appears.
For if the blood is dark, then you let it flow until it becomes red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it becomes thin; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is lessened.
And it is necessary for someone who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting in one session, that the incision of the vein be broadened and the incision be long.
And for someone who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to draw blood from them in several sessions, and the opening should be narrow.
And the best way to perform bloodletting from a vein is by making a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safer from blood flow and nerve damage, and is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting according to width and length.
And for those who are prone to fainting during bloodletting, you should treat them beforehand with a small piece of bread soaked in wine of pomegranate or simple warm vinegar; and draw off the blood in three or four sessions.
And if the constitution is cold, then before bloodletting, give them bread soaked in myrrh syrup, or syrup of fragrant honey mixed with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar, or a highly fragrant aromatic syrup.
And if fainting occurs during bloodletting, and it is caused by the rapid loss of much blood, then they should drink water of flesh and a very fragrant, delicate syrup; and use aromatics with a poultice, and have their feet wrapped in that.
And use the other remedies mentioned in the chapter on fainting due to evacuation.
And whoever wants to treat their arm and resolve their blood a second time, for whom bloodletting is a significant evacuation, and its effect is slow, should evacuate the blood gradually, that is, according to the amount of the medicine's effect over successive days.
But whoever wants to treat their arm and bleed them a second time, and their body is strong, then do so approximately seven or nine hours after the first bloodletting.
But whoever wants to draw the blood of their body to the opposite part from which it is tending, it should be treated on the second or third day.
But that body in which the blood is already very heated and is inflamed and causes fever, it is necessary to let blood from it in one go and a large amount, and increase the incision until fainting occurs, provided you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and that you place your hand over the patient's wrist, near their body, so as to prevent death rather than fainting, because this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not appropriate when you want to treat the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, when the vein's opening has already closed and the blood is difficult to draw, that you press heavily, and the limb is slightly bent, for this is too bad.
Having left it until it has been blood-let a second time; or remove it with the sharpness of the lancet, which has clotted the blood in the vein's opening; or place a little theriac, or of sagzenea, on it, and press it gently until the blood has exited.
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you should bleed from that spot or the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called the "funis of the arm" is opened instead of the cubital or the basilic vein, when these are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of those.
And the procedure for bloodletting involves the patient immersing their hand in warm water until the vein becomes red and clearly visible.
And then press firmly on the area with moderate pressure; and then make the incision along a small transverse line, not horizontally or lengthwise.
And let the opening be wide, and let your incision be a small one, making the bloodletting near the wrist joint.
And if the flow of blood is stopped, then you should re-immerse the hand in warm water and allow the blood to run into the water until you achieve your desired outcome.
However, if you are in the summer months, you may be excused from re-immersion in warm water, and the patient's body is immersed in warm water only during winter.
And bloodletting from this vein is safer than from any other vein, because beneath it there is no pulsating vein or nerve.
And bloodletting from the vein on the right wrist is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the technique of bloodletting from this vein is that you should hold the wrist, either with a bandage or with your hand, after you've placed it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; then make the incision across it; and if you cut it all the way through, this will not harm it in any way.
And be careful not to cut too deeply with the lancet, because beneath that are the nerves of the exposed fingers (or digits).
And now return the hand to the warm water and allow the blood to flow freely from it, for if you don't return it to the warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and it will prevent further flow.
And when the blood is drawn to the desired amount, then you apply oil and salt to the vein to prevent it from quickly closing; and similarly, you should do this on every cut (or branch) made.
However, the benefit of bloodletting from the left hand is that it is helpful for diseases of the spleen.
And do the same in bloodletting him (or her) as you did in the other (hand).
And the benefit of bloodletting from the saphenous vein is for illnesses in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and for retention of menses, and for diseases of the kidneys and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the procedure for bloodletting him (or her) is that the patient should place their foot in hot water and rub it until the veins are visible; and tie the area around the foot with a bandage; and the location of the vein, which becomes visible near the toe, has many small branches running across the surface of the foot.
And therefore, bloodlet the widest branch, either below the leg towards the heel or towards the area of the swelling, because it is better and more effective.
And if you bloodlet that on the surface of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that lie beneath the surface of the foot, and make your bloodletting cut across it, like if you were trying to split it.
And let the bloodletting be done carefully.
But if the release of blood is forbidden; then you immerse the patient's foot in hot water and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
And if the bloodletter errs the first time, then repeat the bloodletting a little further, because the area is sensitive; and don't fear harming them, but rather be careful of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same for the sole of the other foot as well.
And for the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, below the bone of the outside part.
And the benefit of bloodletting for him is for hip pain when it is caused by hot blood.
And the method of bloodletting for him is that the patient enters a bath, and tightly bandages the thigh from the wide part up to above the heel with a long, thin bandage for four days, because it only appears by this means.
And therefore, when it appears, then you bleed him according to the best possible method and according to the transverse way, and it is better; either cut it with an incision or cut it with a section, for the location is saline.
And it is in many men very hidden; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch, then bleed any branch of it, and it is that which appears on the back of the foot near the so-called auricular and annular (areas/structures).
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow the amount you desire.
And then loosen the constriction and place a cloth over the site of the bloodletting and bind the area tightly, for it will be quickly healed.
Of cupping and the qualities of their use.
Cupping is of horns, or of earth, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and the extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping that is without scarification is in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And for cupping that is done with scarification and blood extraction, there are fourteen locations on the body, of which one, where cupping is applied, is the nape of the neck, and it is the back part of the head; and the middle place of it is of two parts of the neck together; and cupping of the chin below the jaw, then below the mouth; and cupping of two shoulder blades; and cupping of the armpits, and it is above the end of the ribs; and cupping of two temples, and it is of two arms; and cupping of two calves; and cupping of two thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not exhaust the virtue through them, as is the case with bloodletting; nor is it proper for cupping to be done with or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the entire body has been evacuated.
But if necessity compels cupping for illness or for a persistent condition, administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle, and at any other time.
Therefore, when in any of those cases, and specifically if it is in the middle third of the month, then we recommend cupping be done after two or three hours have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the neck is that when it relieves heaviness in the head and what is clouding the eyes; however, this should be with the evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of a phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not permitted for those with a cold constitution, or those with a catarrh, to use it, for it brings great harm to them.
And therefore, it is not suitable for the elderly, or those with cold ailments in their heads, to use it.
But for whoever is continuously working on the patient, oblivion is likely; and therefore, you should command the cupper to slowly move the cup downwards, to prevent the generation of oblivion.
But cupping with a leech is in place of phlebotomy of the vena fusca and basilica: and therefore, it is effective for asthma, and constriction of the windpipe, and fracture of the windpipe, and coughs, and fullness.
And the leech-cup should be lifted slightly, for if it is placed too low, it engenders weakness in the body and stomach.
And cupping with an *alhagdahan* is effective for accidental pains in the head and ophthalmia, migraine, feverishness, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And you should instruct the cupper not to press too hard with the scarification, so that they do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping beneath the chin is effective for colds in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar illnesses in the mouth, and it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the veins in the lips.
But cupping on the two shoulder blades is effective against *caphatan* (a likely ailment, possibly heatstroke), which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two parts inside the armpits is helpful for three vein phlebotomy – that is, the basilic, the cephalic, and the humeral vein – because it draws blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh, and these small veins draw from the larger ones until the drawing effect reaches the three major veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed too deeply with the scarification, for the area is bare of flesh, and below it are nerves and arteries.
And a cupping treatment applied to the buttocks is effective against hemorrhoids and ulcers in the lower parts of the anus.
And you must instruct the cupper to use a large, strong cupping glass, for the area requires a forceful suction;  weak, flimsy cupping glasses are ineffective, and the area should be scarified with a cut.
However, cupping of the legs is less effective due to its obvious limitations, as it draws blood from the entire body and helps with long-standing aches in the hips, back, bladder, and menstruation.  It can also ease pain and swelling, and serve as a substitute for phlebotomy using two needles, and later two cauterizing probes.
However, it greatly weakens the whole body and can cause fainting in many people.
And the benefit from these cuppings is similar to the benefits from cupping both legs.
And the proper application of cupping is to initially apply an empty cup and draw out the blood with moderate suction, and do not prolong the application of the cupping glasses, but rather place them lightly, and remove them gently, allowing the humors to return to the area gradually. And do not stop repeating this process until the area becomes red and swollen, and the redness of the blood is apparent.
And then you scarify and repeat the suction gradually, and then consider the disposition of the body.
For that person with delicate, easily bruised skin, you should scarify only once, to prevent the area from becoming ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to enlarge the scarification slightly, and to gently moderate the suction.
And if the blood is thick, then you should scarify twice, for in the first instance the path is opened for the blood and its moisture to be drawn out. But in the second, you take advantage of the knowledge gained from the extraction of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very impure, then a third scarification should be performed to achieve the final result.
And finally, when we wish to extract blood slowly or a little bit, one scarification is sufficient.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we scarify with many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to scarify with deep scarifications.
And the depth of the scarification should only be the length of a fingernail.
And if the skin over which the cupping is to be performed is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, the places for the cupping glasses should be treated with soothing, opening, and resolving ointments; if it is summer, this could be almond oil, violet oil, or oil from soft almonds, or from poppy seeds; and if it is winter, then narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or bloodroot oil, and similar ones.
And if the excess is thick and cold, then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balm oil, or almond oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.
However, if the cupping area is full of pores and has tender flesh, then it is necessary to avoid using oil, and instead, the areas around the cupping glasses must be washed with water or cool water from the solanum plant, or poppy water, or water from the borage plant, and similar ones.
And for someone whose blood has excessive moisture, wash the cupping areas with sour wine, or water with myrtle and sumac, and similar things.
And for someone whose excesses are thick, wash their cupping areas with old wine, or with water of yarrow (which is majorana), or with an infusion of dill, or with chamomile, and similar ones.
And the cupping should be avoided before a bath; after the bath, it should be administered approximately one or two hours later, and it is necessary that the patient rest after the cupping.
What is that which should be governed/controlled for the bloodletting or cupping before the cupping procedure?
One should consider at the start: if the person to be cupped or bled is choleric and has hot, inflamed blood, then they should take cooling things, such as milfoil (milgranas acetosas), endive in sour wine, lettuce, dry herbs (secanabin), juleps, and similar things.
And provide them with foods like small birds, and game birds' flesh, and foods seasoned with sour ingredients, and similar things.
And for one whose complexion is cold, they should drink syrup of licorice or syrup made from the seeds of alsecanabin, and sumac, and very fragrant wine—a mix between young and old—and they should be advised to consume little food and drink, and have as meals small birds, hemp seeds, pigeons, and small birds and doves.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, the drink should be more than the food.
And it is necessary that some people be given to drink at certain times theriac alpharac, or musks—that is, musk—or other medications before cupping or bloodletting, or shortly before, so that the main members are strengthened and the blood is refined; and they should not take those heated.
But the cupping that is done without incision should be cupping placed on the liver, the spleen, gout, and the navel, on the knee-caps, and the groin area, for these areas do not tolerate incision upon them.
And it is not desired by these [cuppings] except for drawing blood from a limb, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in illness of blood flow from the nose; and we use this to dissolve cold, sticky airiness from the limb, just as we place one on the abdomen and the navel; because that one refines the limb, warms it, and eases the pain by resolving the airiness.
And it is already placed on the kidneys when they become blocked or filled with impurities, for by the virtue of strong suction, it quickly opens the blockages and eradicates the impurities from their location.
And similarly, it acts when placed on the liver and spleen to remove the airiness contained within them.
And these cupping glasses are administered empty, with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and becomes larger; it is either just warm water or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
The form of a cupping glass administered with fire:  Let the width of the opening be two fingers, as we have shaped it; and the amount of heat be half a palm; and it should be on the patient's side, in the area that is approximately halfway around the body, the hole should be small, enough for a needle to enter.
Let it be made of red or citrus wood, with thick edges, smooth, and even so that it does not displace the limb from its position on the patient.
And in the middle of it should be a transverse rod of wood or iron, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And this cupping glass should be significantly larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one should be smaller depending on the ailments and the age of the person using it.
The cupping glasses for children and the weakened are different from those for young people and those with strong physiques.
And the method of applying this cupping glass with fire to the limb is to gently heat the cupping glass with wood fire in front of a small wax candle, and place this over the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is kindled around the lower part, to prevent the patient's body from being burned.
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be over the hole we mentioned, until when the cupping glasses are applied and we do not need the finger anymore and the vapor escapes through that hole, then the cupping glass will immediately be detached.
And repeat the process according to its (the cupping) method, and repeat it if necessary.
But a cupping glass used for pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod or hole, and is not applied otherwise than being filled with water, and placed directly on the limb.
And this is its method:  The larger this cupping glass is, the better, so that it can receive a large quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not applied to many limbs, but only to those parts where cupping is impossible due to their small size, such as the foot and the groin, and similar areas; or to limbs lacking flesh, like the penis and the nose, and their like.
And the quality of using those leeches is found in still, clear waters of muddy bottoms.
And then they should be left in fresh water during the day and night until they are hungry, and no food remains in their stomachs; and then the body should be emptied at the beginning with bloodletting and cupping; and then rub the patient's limb until it turns red; and then the leeches should be placed on it.
And when they are full and engorged.
And if suction from the area with a cupping vessel is possible, it is better afterward for healing.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and afterward with clean water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the body of blood is prolonged near the attachment of the leeches, and there is a discharge, then you should soak a cloth in cool water and place it over it until the discharge is stopped.
And if the blood is excessive, then sprinkle powdered vitriol, or other similar astringent substances, on it until the blood is stopped; or place roasted chickpea husks over the area, and leave them until the husks adhere to the location, and the blood is stopped.
And if necessary, repeat the application of leeches, when it is possible to replace them.
And if the leeches are forbidden for application, then the area should be rubbed with fresh blood or a needle should be inserted into the locations until blood comes out; and then they [i.e., the leeches] should be applied, for when they sense blood, they immediately attach.
And when you want them to detach, sprinkle a little powdered aloes, or salt, or ashes, on them, and they will detach quickly.
Thus begins the treatment for the third part: restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations accidentally occurring in the bones.
Oh, son, know that foolish and vulgar doctors, and those who have never looked at the books of the Ancients or read a single letter from them, boast of this chapter.
And for this reason, this method of learning in our land is neglected; and I have never forgotten this at all; and I have not adopted this from what I learned, but through the length of reading the books of the Ancients and studying their meaning, until I extracted knowledge from them.
And afterward I devoted myself to experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have now described in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge and upon which my experience has been passed; since I have summarized this for you and freed it from lengthy explanations; and I have summarized it at the end of the summary; and I have demonstrated this at the end of the declaration; and have formed in it many forms of the instruments that are administered in this, as is done by adding a declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
First Chapter.
A summary and collection of the nature of bone fractures, and of the prerequisites before we begin to remember fractured limbs and their various types. Therefore, let us begin this chapter with a summary of the subject matter; and the chapters on which the artisans are initially required to understand the truth of those things; that is, you and those who are eager to know or learn this noble art, along with others who may follow.
Therefore, I say that when an accident occurs involving a fracture, dislocation, twisting, or injury, then it is necessary for you to begin with bloodletting or relieving the area, or both together, unless some cause prohibits it, such as weakness, or the person affected is a child, or an elderly person, or the time is one of intense heat, or intense cold.
And afterwards, the patient should be given food consisting of cool herbs and the meat of birds and rabbits; and we forbid heavy meats and filling foods, and all food that fills the veins with blood, until you are certain of avoiding a hot abscess, and if you do not fear the discharge of matter in the limb.
And then, return the patient to their former regimen, with which they are accustomed.
And thus, as the broken bone begins to be restored, it is necessary that the patient eat nutritious foods, of a substantial, thick, and heavy nature, in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and soups, and peas, and cow's stomachs, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wines and similar to those, and with this regimen the fracture is more easily and better consolidated.
And know that broken bones in the elderly and the very young are not likely to be joined and consolidated according to their nature because of the drying out of their limbs.
However, nature brings together and connects over the broken bone from all sides some substance similar to glue, in which there is thickness that adheres to and strengthens it until they are completely glued and bound together, until they reach the point of strength and firmness, just as fire at the beginning until no cause prevents it from its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary that the patient eat foods that are heavy, viscous, and thick, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the skull bone; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the arm bone; and similarly all the other limbs are different from each other.
And I come with a reminder of every type of fracture, explained in its own distinct chapter.
There is great diversity in fractures themselves. And the types of bone fractures themselves are diverse; for there is an arched fracture, and another where splinters occur; and sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the shaft, and splinters, and proceeding and non-proceeding additions, just as in a pen when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a break and a crack in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And for every type, there is a specific method or treatment in its restoration, according to the memory of it being distinct in its places.
A clear sign of a bone fracture. And by this the fracture of the bone is known: it is its twisting, and its protrusion and appearance to the touch, and this is of it when you press it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the area, nor is it felt by your touch when you touch the bone with pressure and the patient does not experience great pain, then there is no fracture here.
However, it is possible that there is a twisting or small crack, so it is not necessary for you to manipulate it with your hand and with overall compression; instead, place on it the medicines from which a cure comes at that moment which is appropriate for the location; and then it should be made tight by a subtle constriction.
And know that when the place is bent and is not split in two or otherwise harmed in its alignment, as long as the entire part of its structure is intact, then it is necessary to begin at once to rectify it, before a painful abscess occurs there.
And if an abscess develops there, then leave it for a few days until the abscess subsides; and then treat it by whatever means you can of gentleness and ingenuity.
And know that the restoration and mending of soft tissue is easier than that of bone, where damage has occurred.
And then strengthen it according to the cure that follows.
But if the bone is damaged, then the broken member (be it hand or foot) requires extension of the two parts;  if the member is small, use your hand; or use two ropes or one rope and a hand.
And maintain the position in which you place the mended member according to its natural form, while the broken member parts are extended.  Then you must work with ingenuity to restore those additions to their proper places.
And watch, using your strength, that your procedure does not cause pain or injury to the patient.  Strive to your utmost to join the bone with its companion according to their best forms.
And it is necessary at that time to skillfully touch it with your hand, and if there is any different cause, correct and adjust it with the strength of your skill.
Avoid excessive extension and compression, as some foolish doctors do, often causing suppuration or causing contraction in the limb, as we have seen in their many procedures.
The appropriate level of restraint for the calmed limb is what I recommend; so that you know that broken limbs vary in their smallness and size, and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm, finger, and toe, and similar parts, then the wrapping should be of a very thin, soft cloth.
However, for those that are large, such as the thigh or leg, a firm and strong wrapping is needed, for a firm bandage connects the large limb and binds it tightly all around, so that no fluid enters.
And now, begin your treatment, placing a suitable bandage over the fracture site, using three or four wraps depending on the limb's needs; and gently tighten the bandage with your hand.
And now, move towards the most superior part of the fracture site, and tighten the bandage less tightly than you did on the fracture site itself. And now, gently loosen the wrapping around the fracture site a little, and gradually ease the tightness, until a large part of the site is loosened.
And now, take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken site with a bandage, and now move the wraps to the lower part of the fracture; and let your procedure involve tightening the bandage and loosening it according to what we have said in the first bandage above.
And now, place between the wraps a pad of linen or cloth, to address any twisting in the fracture, if there is any; and if not, place no additional material there.
And now, place another bandage over these neatly made wraps, immediately, if there is no inflammation or a painful abscess in the area.  If there is, place on it something that reduces the abscess and relieves the inflammation; leave it for a few days, and then tighten the bandages.
Let the splints be made of half-cane, or well-formed wood; or of pine wood; or of palm fronds; and let the width of each splint be according to this shape and this figure:
However, the splint placed over the fracture should be slightly larger and wider than the others, and the length of the splint should match the size and smallness of the limb; and then tighten the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then tie it securely on top with thread, as we have already stated about tightening,  meaning that your tightening should follow the location of the fracture most closely, and the further it is from the fracture, the looser the tightening.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fineness, and made of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the operation of some fools, using ropes or thick twisted threads, that is a great error, when the tightening loses its evenness.
Likewise, thin threads are not suitable, for you will not achieve the desired tightening with them, and there should be at least one finger's width between each splint.
And if the patient is sensitive at the ends of the splints near the tight bindings, then place under them some soft linen or wool that is not irritating, until this does not cause him injury.
Sometimes a fracture occurs with a wound, and a separation happens in the bone, and I will return to the discussion of this in the second chapter on specific cases.
And know that not every broken limb should be bound with splints on the first day; the reason is that when the limb is large, you should not place splints upon it until approximately 5, 7, or more days, depending on your judgment about the possibility of a suppurative inflammation developing.
And this is the method of plasters with which the Ancients used to heal fractures, dislocations, and twisting injuries.
A method of a common plaster for fracture healing, suitable for many constitutions, and especially for women and children, because it does not induce heat or cold: take powdered flour, the pith of the flour, which comes from the grinding process in the walls of the mill.
And prepare this as it is, but sieve it with egg white, and apply the mixture neither thick nor thin; and use it thus.
Another method of plaster for healing fractures, dislocations, and twists: a recipe using asafoetida, ladanum, acacia, enula, and wild chamomile root, all 1/4 cup; myrrh and aloe, 1/8 cup; aloes, 2 cups; all ground and sifted, then mixed with rose water or egg white if the patient's constitution is hot.  Use this plaster, as it is a good composition and heals slightly fractured bones and is beneficial for many people.
Another method of plaster for fractures and twists:  recipe using wild chamomile and white marshmallow root, 1/4 cup; myrrh and aloe, 1/8 cup; acacia, 3/8 cup; Armenian bole, 2 cups.
All are ground in a mortar with much grinding, sifted, and mixed with water or egg white, and then applied.
A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and to relieve accidental pain in them, and for fissures and fractures:  take absorbent wool and soak it in sour wine and cooked oil, and place it on the affected area.
However, this plaster does not have the virtue of restoration, but rather of relieving acute inflammation and expelling pain effectively.
Another method of plaster to restore a broken bone: take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; crush them all together and make a plaster from them.
A shortened method of plaster for assisting in the restoration of a broken bone, and when you want resolution of remaining inflammation: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile flowers and violet flowers, and powdered yarrow; pulverize all, and mix with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then temper it with moist coriander water, or with water and vinegar.
Another, stronger type of plaster for resolving deep inflammation for the restoration of a limb: take roots of marshmallow, linseed, baluster, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile; pulverize them all, and mix them with willow water, or fresh water, or wine, depending on the nature of the limb and its colour.
However, Hippocrates in his book does not say that it should be placed on the broken limb during restoration, but rather a cerot (plaster) made of wax and oil, and nothing else; and recommends that it be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
However, in Gaul, it is seen that these are placed on the broken limb during restoration, and the ingredients for which drying with little warmth are good, such as myrrh, frankincense, and similar substances to those we have mentioned.
A plaster for injuries and pain: take equal parts of cedar, human skin (or animal skin), marshmallow, and salt; grind and sift them, then mix to form a plaster.
However, regarding the amount of time the bandage should remain on, and when to remove it, consider if there is no pain, swelling, or if the bone is broken or dislocated. In this case, you should not remove the bandage for many days. And if intense pain, swelling, or inflammation occurs at the site, then you should remove or loosen the bandage immediately, and remove the plaster.
And take clean cloth and a dampened piece of sea sponge, soak it in lukewarm water, and wash the affected area with it until the swelling subsides and the pain is relieved; then allow the limb to rest for an hour.  Then place on the area a piece of wool soaked in sour wine and oil or olive oil, and bandage it for one night until you are sure there is no festering boil, and the limb's inflammation is reduced, and the pain is gone.
Then, repeat this delicate compression and small plaster application, and do not apply the initial pressure again, but use it gently until it heals.
And if the boil, hardness, pain, inflammation, and all other symptoms have completely subsided, and you no longer need a plaster and compression, then repeat the process as you did at the beginning in the same manner.
And if no symptoms like those we have mentioned occur in the limb, then do not remove the bandage for three, four, five, or seven days; and sometimes this is left on for twenty days, depending on how the limb looks, as we have mentioned, until the fracture adheres and the flesh around it coagulates.
Then, apply more pressure to the bandage than you did originally, and increase the patient's food intake, as the patient's recovery progresses.
But if you find the fracture site already dried out and weakened more than necessary, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.  Therefore, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you remove the bandage, and do so every three days.  Ease the compression slightly, and by this action, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals more easily.
However, what foolish bone setters do, restoring the fractured limb a second time when it wasn't properly set initially,  and setting it in a twisted manner, is an error in their practice, and a great risk.  If they had done it correctly, the ancients in their books would have shown it, and would have worked this way.
And I have not seen any of them do this, which makes it more reasonable that you should not do it.
Second Chapter: Of fractures when occurring to the head.
The types of fractures are numerous, and their shapes are diverse, and their causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow from a weapon, and the blow crushes all the bone up to the skull, which is beneath the bone, just as it does to a tree trunk.  Therefore this type is called a crushed fracture; or the weapon cuts a portion of the bone, and cuts the flesh but does not penetrate to the back of the bone; and this type of fracture is called a simple fracture.
And the severity of these two fractures is either great or slight, and a fracture is either a crushing or a grinding; and the cause of them is a blow with a blunt object or a fall on a stone, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, coming close to the membrane beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the severity of these two fractures is either great or slight.
And a fracture that is hidden within the bone, in the smallness of a hair, and because of that this type is called a capillary fracture.
And a fracture is made either by falling or by a blow from a stone and similar things, which causes a sliver of the bone to be driven inwards, and is made in the hollow part just as happens to the spokes of a wheel when they are struck and are splintered from their entrance to the inner parts.
And this is more often done in the soft bones of children's heads.
And all these types of fractures, there are fragments, like separated stars. And I will come with a restoration of all that to its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by probing them, and by examining them with probes and the presence of decaying flesh on top of them.
A specific fracture is recognized because it is uncovered on the bone, and is scraped clean and probed, for the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of fractures, consider first the patient's symptoms, and if you see through those symptoms a clear indication of fear, such as vomiting, trembling, loss of understanding, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, and swelling and stiffness of the limbs, and similar symptoms in severe cases, without doubt it will not be cured.
And if you see symptoms that are not severe, you hope for recovery, then you begin the treatment of it.
The reason for this is that if the injured person comes to you at the beginning, as they are injured and it is during the winter days, then you must study the removal of the bone by the fourteenth day, according to all circumstances.
And if it is during the summer days, then you must attempt to remove the bone by the seventh day, before the tissue underneath the bone decays, and the symptoms we have described occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the tissue covering the brain, and is with fragmented and crushed pieces, then you must cut out the fragmented and crushed part, as I will describe to you.
And you must shave the head of the injured patient, and expose the bone according to the custom and manner possible for you, according to the nature of the injury, and that it is easy on the patient.
And if you encounter bone exposure, blood flow, or a hot abscess, then you must oppose it with what is necessary, and you should fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rubbed oil, and allow the injury to rest until the abscess is calmed and the blood flow is certain; then begin the process of cleaning the bone and removing it.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you cut the bone with a narrow, sharp scalpel, and this is its form: And then you place another scalpel alongside it, a little wider than the first; and this is its form:
And then place another scalpel wider than the second one.
And you need a variety of scalpels, some wider than others, and some shorter than others, with the sharp edges of their ends, and they should be made of hardened or tempered steel.
And use them with ease in striking the scalpel so that you do not strike the head and damage it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then you need to make holes around it before you use the scalpels with the drilling tools, which are called non-deepening drills.
And they are not called that because they do not reach the surface of the bone close to it, for the drill has a rounded tip or edge on the one below the head, sharp like an edge or a small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each suited to the thickness of each bone, so that you have on hand for all the skull bones, the tip of each being sharp, the length and shortness being according to the thickness of each bone.
And this is the method for three kinds of drills:  The method of drilling around a fractured bone is to place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone is penetrated; then change the drill to another spot, and place whatever is between the holes the size of the bone's thickness or around that.
And then cut with scalpels what is between each hole in the bone, and make it as fine as possible, as light as possible, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other tool such as fine pliers or forceps.
And you must carefully ensure that the scalpel does not touch any part of the skull.
And therefore, once you have drilled around the bone, and if it is joined to the skull, you must separate it; and once you have extracted it, you must rasp and smooth the rough area of the bone with another instrument similar to a scalpel, but it must be thinner and more delicate than the other scalpels.
And if any small bone fragments remain, then remove them easily with your tools; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments as we have described.
And another method of operation is easy, free from fear, which Gualtier and Launcelot highly praised; and this is their teaching: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin to expose the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and noticeable, until when you have exposed that part and have placed under it the tip of this slow and gentle scalpel, of which this is the shape:
And it is that the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the pointed part is bent in two directions, forward in length, as you see; so that the lenticular part is fitted to the skull with the pointed cutting face against the bone.
Then strike the scalpel on a part with a small mallet until you cut through the entire bone easily as it is turned, and you are sure that no accident will occur, whatever fear you might have.  And if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them, certainly, and if he were asleep...
Then, if any remains attached to the bone of the bandage in any part of the bone, cut it with the tip of that lenticular scalpel, and release it easily, for it is released without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the bandage, and whatever is cut away or removed from the bone is its surface, and there remain roughnesses and subtle irregularities, then it is necessary to smooth those roughnesses and eliminate those irregularities with fine razors, of which you have prepared a variety of sizes, so that you may be able to apply the most suitable ones to every part and the most appropriate ones according to where you are directing your operation on that broken bone and its shape.
And it is necessary that in your procedure, with which you smooth the bone, you begin with the widest of those razors, and then successively use the finer ones, and do not cease doing this continuously until you reach the finest and most subtle of all of them.
However, in each of the other small, capillary fractures and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer treatment according to what you perceive as the rectification of them.
And it is a cause that is not hidden from all those who have studied in that art. And we have shown in this what we have written about major fractures.
And if the skin is pulled back when you expose the bone, then it is necessary that you take a cloth in the quantity of the wound, and immerse it in heated oil, and place it over the wound opening; and then take another cloth, folded or tripled, and immerse it in wine and heated oil, and place it over the first cloth, and do this as gently as possible, so that you don't aggravate the injury; and then apply a wide bandage, and don't tighten it except to the extent that the wound is held still only.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure of a warm abscess; and then remove it, and then administer medicines that address excessive dryness, such as flax seeds, and rye flour, and powdered fenugreek and similar herbs.
And you should make a powder from these medicines, ground into powder, so that they are dry; and in general, administer any medicine which has the property of cleansing but not irritating.
And be careful, based on your skill, that the wound in your treatment remains clean; and that there is no pus or other foulness; and do not allow any further virulence to accumulate; for when it is added to the skin of the brain, it corrupts and rots it, and this causes a very serious and harmful disease in the patient.
And it affects the skull, especially when the bone is exposed and the treatment is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, if you see the patient experiencing the symptoms we have described, know that it is dangerous without a doubt.
And if the blackness is not from the wound itself, but rather from the medicine applied, and that medicine is the cause of the blackness, then you should take one part honey and three parts of warmed olive oil, and with them, soak a cloth.  Then place it on the skull, and then treat it with the appropriate healing spices until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the restoration of a broken nose.
Know that a broken nose is not simply broken in two; rather, it may be fractured in several places, sometimes only in one, because there are two bones in the nose.  The lower part is cartilaginous and not actually fractured, but is damaged by friction, twisting, and bending.
However, if only one of the two parts is broken, you should insert your little finger into the nose, and use your index finger to grasp the fracture, pushing outward with your middle finger, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this with ease, and be careful not to cause further pain to the patient because of your procedure.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, where the finger cannot reach, then it must be manipulated with the tip of a rounded, slightly thickened instrument (a type of probe/spatula).
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you should do the same procedure as described above.
And try to restore it on the first day of the fracture if possible; if not, then approximately on the 7th or 10th day, you should carefully treat the resulting inflammation.
And if the fracture is in one part, insert a small piece of linen into the nasal opening; or if the fracture is in two parts, insert two pads, each having enough thickness to fill the nasal cavity.
Some ancient healers advised that the pads be soaked in broth and changed daily, but I don't find this to be the best approach.  Instead, the pad should be soaked in a mixture of beaten, sweetened egg white with ground spice/powder; and leave it in place until the bone is set and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a pad, a linen bandage is used inside the nose, especially if the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not able to breathe normally.
And this method is not strictly necessary; if you wish, use it, and if you wish, use the pads instead.
And if another boil appears, cover the nose with a cerot (plaster) or with cotton soaked in sour wine and olive oil, or with diachylon.
But if no further boils appear, then you should cover the existing one with barley flour and powdered herbs mixed with beaten egg white; then place a linen bandage over it and do not tie the nose with anything else.
But if the nasal bones are fractured, even slightly, or broken into pieces, then you must cut (remove) over those parts, and extract them with instruments appropriate to this; then close the fracture and treat it with things that promote healing and strengthening, and with suitable plasters.
And if a plague appears inside the nose, then you must treat it with pads and administer lead cannulae until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Concerning the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture isn't accompanied by an infection, then consider whether the fracture is only outward, and not broken in two and bent inward, in which case its reduction is easy.
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you must insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the said index finger of your right hand; and push the protrusion of the fracture inwards easily towards the outside, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; gently bring them together.
And if the jaw fracture is already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer extension to both parts according to their alignment until their reunion is possible.
And if you encounter displacement of teeth along with a disruption, then secure those that you expect to remain with gold, silver, or silk thread; then place a compress on the fractured jaw, and then place a doubled cloth over it, and put a large, well-made bandage, or a piece of linen the length of the jaw, over that; and then bind it according to your skill in bandaging and the need for application until it is not damaged.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him easily digestible food.
And if you estimate that the form has been altered in any way, then you should remove and loosen it on the third day; then correct whatever is altered, and apply a poultice of ground chalk, egg white, or fine flour, after you have removed the compress, and place a soft wool covering over the poultice.
And then, when this poultice is properly affixed and the bone position is not altered, leave it; do not remove it until the fracture is healed and the bone is strong; for many times, this fracture is healed in three weeks.
And if, again, a festering boil occurs, then administer what we have often said for its resolution until it is healed and the boil is gone.
And if the fracture is with a gap, then consider if it is a detached piece of bone or splinters; then you must carefully remove those splinters with whatever is appropriate for removing them from the instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with leeches according to your need.
And after you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains, then you close the wound opening if it is wide; and if not, place one of the appropriate poultices over it and allow it to heal until it is sound.
Chapter 5.
Of the restoration of the collarbone when it is fractured.
Often the collarbone is fractured on the part in front of the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
When it is fractured, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is such that splinters occur, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is such that the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the aid and steadies the fractured collarbone, and the other extends the neck toward that area.
And then hold the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct, as is appropriate, and neither protrudes too much nor is concave.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's neck a pad of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to your need; and extend and elevate the collarbone and compress the pad with your hand until you align the fracture as is appropriate.
And if you cannot pull the collarbone's ends outward, because it has become impacted, then the patient should be placed supine on their back, and a pillow of medium size should be placed on their muscle.
And the assistant presses on the patient's muscle from below so that the collarbone bone is elevated from its impacted position, and then you straighten the fracture and hold it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the collarbone and they are loose, then you should cut around them and easily remove those splinters.
And if it is lodged in the bone, then you make an incision with one of the scalpels you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the collarbone the instrument that serves to hold it; and it is an instrument of wood or iron of which this is its shape:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and its width should be according to what you need, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
But its length should be as possible for the operation; it should have two ends like a pair of tongs, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the opening of the wound you made when removing the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are certain of a hot abscess, then you should bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches.
And if the opening is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's gap.
And if a hot abscess arises, then soak a cloth in sour wine and rubbed oil and wine, and place it over that.
And be careful that the bandage does not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you must check the patient every day.  When the ligament is softened or you see the bandage has come loose, then you should rectify this and tighten the bandage.
Then, place the patient's sleeping position on their neck, and place a small cushion under their armpits, underneath the pillow, so that the patient's shoulder is elevated, and thus the fracture of the collarbone is raised to the height of the muscle; or the arm is secured to the neck.
And do not loosen the bandage if there is no obvious suppuration or abscess at the site, until twelve days have passed.
And then renew the plaster if you see the patient's skin reacting to it, and adjust it to the fracture and keep it there until the fracture of the collarbone has healed and solidified.
And it is strengthened and comforted within twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some individuals, it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Of the restoration of a fractured shoulder.
The shoulder blade is fractured on its outer side, and it is not broken in the middle but at the edges.
And therefore, when the middle of the shoulder is fractured, and it is not apparent but known only by touch, then, according to the nature of the fracture, you must prepare it and restore it to its natural form by every possible means.
Then place on the area powdered millstones with egg white and linen cloth; then place folded cloth; and then place a thin, flat wooden board, sized to cover the entire shoulder blade or a little more.
But if underneath the board there is a hollow in any part of the shoulder blade, then you shall fill that hollow with linen cloth, and then raise the board evenly.
And then tightly bind it from above with a long bandage, with proper constriction and firmness of the board, until it is fixed in place.
And examine the bandage each day; and whenever it becomes loosened, bandage it again, tightening it and repositioning the board if it has shifted from its proper place.
And let the patient lie on their sound side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And therefore when this number of days is complete, then you dissolve the bandage, and be sure that the injury is of the bones, whose connection is not feared, nor their separation.
And if you proceed from the place of the heavy bone and place the splint underneath, then you cut over it, remove it, and act as we said in the fracture of the furcula, or the treatment of an abscess, if that's the case here.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this is often delayed; but the extremities are often more rapidly fractured and crushed.
And the symptoms when it is broken in the middle are that it tilts to the sides, and great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, and a strong, fast pulse, and vomiting of blood occurs; and the cavity in the broken bone is evident, and not hidden from touch.
And the restoration of it is that the patient should be laid on their back, and a cushion placed between their shoulder blades; and then press on the muscles and align the sides of the foot using the hands on both sides, and carefully proceed with the operation and readjustment in every possible and suitable manner until the bone returns to its proper shape.
Then apply a plaster and bandages, and place a thin splint of willow or reed or similar lightweight material over it, and wrap it in cloth; and then carefully bind it around the broken bone so it is not dislocated; and use a circular bandage to support the back in some cases, and tighten it appropriately; and then check the bandage frequently, and when it is softened, tighten it again.
And if the bandage causes irritation, swelling, pain, or an abscess to develop in the area, then you should loosen it and remove the plaster, and treat any problems that result from it with appropriate methods; and then reapply the plaster, if necessary, to the affected area; and adjust the bandage until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
Of the restoration of broken ribs.
Know that a fractured rib usually occurs only in the thicker, middle sections, and the ends or front portions are not easily bruised in that way because they are cartilaginous. And its location is not hidden from examination through questioning.
And the restoration is to align the fracture with the fingers, in the most possible way, until it is properly aligned, and then apply a poultice and bind the broken bone with a splint, if needed.
And if the rib fracture is extending inward, the patient experiences intense pain and stabbing, similar to the pain of someone with pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane; and there is difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting of blood; and this is a difficult condition to cure.
And the ancients were ingenious in dealing with this.
And they said:  You must give the patient foods that generate inflammation and gas, so that the belly is swollen and stretched, and the fracture is pushed outward.
However, we would avoid this, because it is not a light matter to cause a hot abscess, if it does not already exist; and if it already exists, then this approach might help.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on it and then suction applied forcefully; and this seems like a reasonable approach, but nevertheless, it is feared that the cupping glass might draw the superfluities to the area due to weakness.
And some of them said: the area should be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is tight when wrapped around it according to its shape; and then the patient should be treated with a pleurisy-like diet and medicine.
And if a severe cause restricts the patient, who cannot endure it, and the bone pierces the covering with a harmful puncture, we fear for the patient, then we must cut open the area, expose the fractured rib, and then place an instrument to hold the rib in place, the method of which has been explained before, and we must cut the bone easily and remove it.
And then we should bring the two edges of the wound together, if it is large, with stitches, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then you should mix powders in rubbed oil and apply it to the area, and treat the patient with what is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Of the restoration of fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Sometimes fractures occur in the bones of the neck, and sometimes they are caused by friction, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider this: if their muscles are already softened, numb, dead, and you cannot move them, extend them, or squeeze them, and when you press them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and they do not feel pain, then know that they are not healed, and in this condition it is deadly.
And if you move them and feel constriction with your fingers and pricking, then know that the bone's integrity is preserved and that the patient will be healed with treatment.
And if you see a similar condition in the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if it will be healed or not, then consider the patient's feet.
Then if you see that the feet are already softened, observe the condition of the muscles, and when the patient lies on their back, they are affected by involuntary movements and/or bowel movements, and sometimes they are lying on their back, wanting to urinate but unable, then know that it is fatal, and thus do not bother with their treatment.
But if you observe no such symptoms, the cause is milder and less severe.
And the treatment for this is to apply a sedative poultice to the inflamed/irritated vertebra, either with oil or roasted egg yolks; apply this poultice for some time each day until the inflamed area is soothed.
And then apply a comforting and soothing plaster, and bind it tightly; and command the patient to rest and remain tranquil, and not to sleep on the affected area until it is healed.
And if you observe signs of bone breakage or any other detached piece, then you should cut away the surrounding tissue and remove that bone; then bring the two edges of the wound together, using sutures if it's a large wound; and then treat it with a healing ointment until it heals.
But if the back of the bone in the hip is broken, and it is the end of the thigh bone, then you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the rectum, and align the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible according to anatomical order; then apply a plaster and bandage, if necessary, and bind it tightly.
And if you detect broken pieces in that area, then you should cut away at it and remove the broken pieces, and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it heals.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the wide/broad (or large) area/region/space.
The bones of the hips are often broken, and if they break, their fracture is only a connection at the extremities, and they are cut along their length and deviate to the inside; the patient experiences pain in the area and puncturing, and the leg is paralyzed when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you align it according to what is prepared for you by equating it until it is assembled in its natural shape.
But if the fracture is along the length or already deviates towards the lower parts, then you make the patient lie on their stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And therefore, when you have aligned it, place a poultice on it, and then place a splint of wood or cane on it, and tighten it firmly so that you do not fear puncturing the fracture or displacing the splint.
And align the concavity with whatever fills it until it takes on the tightness according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their sound side.
But if a suppurative abscess occurs, then you cease the extension and restoration until the suppurative abscess is subsided, and place on it what calms it according to what has preceded; and then return to the restoration, and tighten it as is appropriate.
And if the bones are shattered or comminuted, then you must remove them.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured limb.
Adjutori" is that which is between the elbow and the top of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a smooth piece of wood of medium thickness, in this fashion:
And having tied two bandages at both ends, it should then be suspended from a raised position.
And place the patient on a stretcher; then, gently lay the patient's broken arm on the wood until the elbow reaches the middle point where the curve of the wood is attached.
And then suspend something heavy over it, or the attendant can extend it further downwards; and then the physician should hold the fracture with their hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
The other method is for the patient to be lying on their back with the arm held by a bandage around the patient's shoulder; then instruct two assistants that one of them holds what is above the fracture with their hands, and the other holds what is below it; and each of them extends in their own direction.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you tighten a bandage over the fracture and another bandage over that, and each of the two assistants extends in their own direction.
And therefore, if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed over the elbow and the other below the fracture towards the arm.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed over that spot and over the elbow.
Apply that easily and without effort, and when it is wrapped as needed and properly applied, then tighten it if a painful abscess does not occur.
But if a painful abscess occurs, then leave the tightening until the seventh day, and place on it wool soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil until the abscess subsides, and then you tighten it.
And the way to tighten that is to place a plaster over the fracture, and then place a wrapping of fresh cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm over that support, and place their open hand over their muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the arm over the support so that the arm is in a straight position, unless some cause from the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And you should place over the fracture that splint which is widest and strongest of the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the break, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the binding which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And make sure your binding over the fracture area is tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the binding should be.
And therefore, adjust the positioning of the splints and the binding as we have described, at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you do so.
And if you fear a suppurative abscess, then you leave the binding and splints on for seven days, as we have stated.
And then consider the limb in all its parts for three days, so that no bruising or inflammation occurs in the area; or the limb is forbidden food due to the excess of binding; and therefore, rectify everything according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that no cause for this will occur, then do not loosen the binding until approximately three days, or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands be on their stomach.
And place on the injured area a poultice of full wool, and make sure at all times of night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not distorted, or that the binding is softened; therefore, correct all of this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order we mentioned before, so that the food is subtle at the beginning until it begins to be strengthened; and then it is necessary to make the food thicker.
Because the custom of the injured area and leg is that they be bound for 40 days; and then it is necessary that they be unbound, and a bath be administered and medicated with ointments which correct that.
And if the fracture is severely inflamed, then you do not loosen the bandage and splints for at least a day or up to two months.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two "foils"; of which one is small, and it is that which sits above the said knuckle, and the other is large and it is that which is situated below the small knuckle, on the lower part.
And frequently the larger foil is broken alone, or the smaller one, and frequently both are broken together.
And when the smaller foil is fractured above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the foil is fractured below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And even worse than that is when both bones are fractured together.
Therefore, if the bone that is fractured is the small foil above, then it is convenient for the physician, for its restoration, to apply a small extension with ease until it is set.
But if the large foil is what is fractured, then it is necessary to apply a more forceful extension.
And if both foils are fractured together, then it is necessary for you to apply the pressure much more forcefully.
And it is necessary that you place the shape of your hand towards the restoration of it and the extension of it stretched over a cushion, and let the palm of the hand be at the upper parts, higher than all the other fingers, and the said thumb be lower than the other fingers, and the patient be lying on a polished, smooth surface.
And there should be a cushion in front of him, at his height or level, so that the patient does not experience discomfort.
And then the minister extends the arm of the lower part with his hand or a bandage, and another minister extends the upper part similarly.
And then the physician repositions the bone until it is reduced to the best possible shape.
And if in the fracture of the bone there are obstacles, then you must use all your skill to reduce each piece to its proper place.
And if there appears a separated obstacle that impedes the setting of the bone and you are not hopeful about restoring it, then you must proceed on it and remove that obstacle using the method mentioned above.
But if the fracture is with pus, I have already made a separate chapter on that, and therefore take care of it accordingly.
And if you encounter a boil or abscess at the beginning of your restoration, then you should line a cloth with a plaster made of roasted oil and white wax, and let it be moderate in thickness and subtle, and tightly bind the cloth over it until the abscess subsides; and then remove the plaster and apply a prepared plaster of powdered mulberry root and egg white, and then place poultices; and the poultice that is placed over that pus-filled fracture should be the strongest and most potent.
And know that the name of the poultices for the arm is given in the major arrangements, or in other words, the fracture is in one or two parts at once.
And then apply your bandage to the site of the fracture as strongly and forcefully as possible, and moreover, if the bandage is applied to the parts above the fracture or the parts below, apply it somewhat less tightly, according to what was mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not hard or rough, and the bandage with which it is bound should be moderately fine and coarse, just as we have described.
And observe the limb and its ligaments for several days. And if any cause arises requiring correction, such as swelling that occurs in the limb, then you must soak the limb in hot water until the swelling subsides.
And leave the limb unbound until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the bandage has softened, and the bone has returned to its proper place, then correct everything with your skill.
And consider if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excess bandaging, for then you must loosen it slightly and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient has no such cause as we have mentioned, then it should not be loosened for approximately twenty days or thereabouts.
And then the patient's hand should be suspended by its own power of movement, and allow them to sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or 32 days, or a very mild one is restored in 28 days, and all of this is according to the constitution and the potency of the individual.
Chapter 13.
Of the restoration of fractures of the wrist and fingers.
Know that a fracture of the wrist and joints of the fingers is often a delayed fracture, and that it frequently happens from repeated trauma rather than a single incident.
And when a fracture or injury occurs to the hand, the patient must be placed lying down on their back with the injured arm extended straight out, and then place their own hand over the extended arm.
Then the assistant stretches the broken bones, and the doctor holds them together until they are firmly rejoined.
And then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, otherwise a painful abscess may develop; then place a splint over the area, proportionate to its size, and you have already wrapped this in a cloth.
But if the fracture is in the parts inside the palm of the hand, then make a bandage shape like a sphere of cloth, and tell the patient to grip it with their fractured palm; then it should be bound with a long strip of cloth.
And let the splint be of leather, with a cloth in which it is supported, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and bind it as is necessary.
However, if the fracture is in the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a splint over it and another splint on the lower part of the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply a bandage, as the hand is wrapped back towards the fingers with ligaments.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be bandaged as necessary, and then it should be held with the palm, and if you want, place a small, straight splint on it so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle finger, or the index finger, or the ring finger, or the little finger, then it should be bandaged and tied with the finger next to it; or all should be tied together following the continuity, which is better; or place a small splint on it, just as we said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and afterwards, the disposition of a festering abscess and its opposition – with your operation – with what is necessary when any such cause occurs, according to how the account of it is repeated.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of a fractured thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and is declared to be fractured according to how it is broken at the front and the most superior part.
And the restoration of it is done by tightening a ligament over the fracture and another ligament under the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on their stomach and on their face.
And then the attendant extends all the ligament to its proper position, when the fracture is in the middle part of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then the ligament should be close to the knee, in the direction of the groin, so that the extension works on it, and the other ligament under the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is near the knee, then the ligament should be placed near the knee, and the extension should be towards the lower parts.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both his hands until it returns to its natural shape and the bone is properly joined; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, otherwise the limb will develop an abscess. But if an abscess occurs, then you must leave it for a few days until the hot abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be applied thus:  it is necessary to wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, fold it two or three times, and remove any excess; then wrap the leg until you reach the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long splint between the thigh and the leg near the knee, towards the lower parts, and let the ends of the splint be on the highest part of both sides; then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.
And then place pads (or, possibly, splints/sticks) on the thigh at the location of the fracture, and place one of these pads over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the fracture is properly secured.
Then start with a strong bandage in the middle over the fracture site, using three or four wraps, and as you move away from the fracture site, the bandage should be progressively less tight, lighter and softer.
Then extend the two ends of the splint downwards until they reach the ankle, and hold both ends of the splints on the other side to ensure the bandage stays in place.
Then leave the bandage on, ensuring that no ulceration, boil, inflammation or similar conditions affect the limb; and if any such problem arises, remove the bandage and correct the issue immediately, as we have often stated.
But if there is a piece of bone protruding, then you must push it back in as best as possible; and if not, cover it and leave it, and treat it according to the previous treatments until healed.
And sometimes this thigh fracture is held together with splints, as we have said regarding the forearm and arm.
However, in a restoration done in this way, the patient does not experience lameness; and if it is restored alone, or the other leg is applied, then it is necessary that the one which has always limped, does so.
And know that the thigh is held in place for forty days, or a little more, or a little less, and all of this according to the diversity of the constitutions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of a kneecap (patella) fracture.
Know that a kneecap fracture is often very painful, but often leads to considerable friction.
But if it is a fracture, then it is only a crack or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a bruise, and everything is based on the sensation.
And the restoration of it is thus: the broken parts are glued together with splints until they are joined together as much as possible by alignment, ease, and crafting.
And then apply a plaster and place it over the circular area, if needed; and bind tightly with a bandage appropriate to this.
And then consider all the treatments we have described in other fractures, just as in case of boils and similar conditions, so that it counters any accident with what is appropriate for it until it heals.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the thigh bone; and the other is thin, and is called the shinbone.
And the treatment for some types of leg fracture is similar to that for the two bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as for the arm, and the operation is similar.
And if both bones are fractured together, the leg is dislocated in every direction.
And if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is dislocated forward.
And if the thicker bone is fractured, you find it underneath, and it is one of those things that is not hidden from you.
And then administer extension, equating, and ligating the splints according to the same procedure.
However, if the leg fracture is large with many splinters, the extension should be smaller and gentler, and alleviate with your skill.
And if there is some operation on the arm for the leg, and when you have splinted and completed all your operation, then you will take pieces of wood that are placed beneath the supports (which are placed under padding), and they are also made from palm branches; choose those of small thickness and not large ones, and their length should be according to the length of the leg, from the top to the bottom.
And then wrap each one in two layers according to its length, placing one on the one side of the leg and the other on the opposite side, and they should extend from the top to the lowest part of the foot.
And then tie the two splints in three places, at the two ends and in the middle, for with this arrangement the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and remains in a good position.
And now a splint of wood has been applied, according to the length of the leg; and the leg is placed upon it so that it preserves its position (literally: so that it conserves that of movement).
And it is especially necessary that you do this in the case of a fracture, and when it is properly a fracture.
And then examine the leg every day and study it with that subsequent study, and watch for abscesses, inflammations, or other similar problems; and if any of these occur, then apply what is necessary to it until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the heel bone and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the heel doesn't happen often; however, fractures of the foot bones do occur sometimes; and fractures of the toes are rare, and they are usually only affected by abrasion at the points of exposure.
And if the bones of the foot suffer a fracture, and the bones are sometimes elevated above themselves, then the patient places their foot on the ground, prepared as if walking.
Then, the patient places one foot on whatever has lifted the bones, and then presses and pushes on them until they return to their proper positions.
And then, apply a plaster and bandage over it, and place a small board with two flat ends underneath the sole of the foot.
And then, tighten that with a descending bandage, now that you have wrapped it in cloths and other things that are necessary.
And after three or four days have passed, then you loosen the bandages, for you will find the bones either pushed together, or broken, or dislocated, and the operation for those is as you know.
But if any bones are broken, then restore them, and put them together in the same way as I have described to you in the restoration of fingers of the hand. And then, place a splint along the length of the broken finger, and let it extend slightly beyond it; and then, under the foot, place this board which I have described to you, and tighten it with a descending bandage.
But if what is broken of the bones is two, three, or more, then you place splints of their respective sizes, wrapped in linen cloth, over each finger.  Tighten the board at the lowest part of the foot.  Place one end of the board outside the foot’s belly, so that it holds firmly.
And it is important for you not to forget that you should consider all the causes which I have told you about other fractures and accidents that we have discussed; and prepare yourself for all eventualities with what is necessary.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the thighbone, the pelvic bone, and the penis in the male.
When the thighbone is fractured, then make a splint of  a smoothed, planed wood, and gently incline it towards the back of the leg, and have it supported behind.
And then the midwife fills the thigh with wool, and it should be applied to the thigh just as it should be; and then the woman should be laid down, and lift the leg gradually, as everything should be placed before the thigh in such a way that the fractured bone returns to its place.
Then place poultices on their back, and when they want to urinate, the wool comes out easily and then they urinate, and you reposition and return it in the same manner as you did at first, and then return it to its original position.
And do this for seven days or so, for that is how it is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tightly insert a reed tube into the opening; then insert the entire bladder into the thigh, and then blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder is inflated inside the thigh, for the fracture will return to its place.
And then it should be filled with wool and left for several days, as we have recounted, until it is healed.
And when the hip bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and setting what we have recounted for the hip bone.
And what is right is not hidden in these close fractures and those that heal slowly, especially for him who has some study and use and understands this my book's words; for this fracture signifies to you, in the greatest ways, the correct path in its restoration and the binding of it, therefore understand well.
But in the case of a broken penis, take a binding made of bird's skin, and place it on the penis; then apply a cloth bandage, and let it remain bound for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractures of bones when [the injury] is from a blow.
It is convenient for the one who has sustained a fractured bone from a blow, especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the shinbone, or similar to those, that you bleed them and lance them immediately if the circumstances of bloodletting indicate it, as we stated above.
And if the blow causes blood to flow, then it is necessary that you apply a styptic to it, in such a way that you powder it with crushed zegi, if another cause is not present.
And then immediately begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not delay this if an abscess does not arise.
However, if a serious abscess arises, then you should delay the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause bad complications.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, then it is necessary to carefully reduce and align it with your hands with ease and little force.
However, if your hands are not equipped to reduce and align it, then you reduce it with these instruments; and this instrument is made of iron, its length being seven or eight inches and its width according to the size of the wound; and for this reason it is necessary for the physician to have three or four of these instruments, according to the needs of the treatment for every type of fracture.
And it should be round, and of little thickness so that it is not compressed against it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp edge at its extremities; and let the upper part of it be thicker, and the middle portion thinner.
And this is its shape:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem," that is, a small spatula.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sharp end be placed high above the prominent bone extremity.
And you push it in one stroke until the bone returns, and it is aligned with some equality.
Therefore, exert yourself to align the fractured extremities, and if the broken extremity is delicate and does not accept the instrument readily, then it is necessary for you to cut the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
However, if you cannot fully reduce the bone with what we have described, then cut it with whatever surgical instruments are appropriate; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away any remaining roughness and small splinters from the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and shortly after the reduction the patient experiences intense pain, then understand that the bone has not returned to its natural position; and then do what you believe will greatly benefit the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and specifically if it is summer, do not apply a plaster or any other oily substance to the wound, so that you do not cause swelling and corruption.
And then administer styptics at the time of your completing the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered, and then cut the wound with scissors and use dressings according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to compress the wound with the fracture, because foolish doctors have often done this, and caused death or a corroding or spreading illness in their patients; this is gangrene. And if your constriction is slight, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear any of the bad accidents we have recounted, and you find pain in the area, then you should not apply styptics, but rather make a dressing of hard cloths instead of styptics and bind it firmly.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to fester, that a suppuration has arisen there, then remove the cloth you had placed on it with wine, and then administer poultices, medicaments with which, according to our custom, we treat wounds, like tetrafarmacon and similar medicaments.
And you should loosen the bandage and examine the wound every day morning and evening until it is healed and firm, and the limb should be prepared in such a way that pus can drain from it to the lower parts with ease.
If the wound has passed many days and is not healed or the pus is not draining from it, then know that there are complications from which you must investigate the wound with a probe. And of those complications, those that are separated, remove and extract them; those that are not separable and cause pain to the limb, force you to cut them as it is possible for you.
And if the wound develops a swelling or inflammation, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then you must apply to it one of those things appropriate for its cure, of which the preceding narrative in its chapter describes.
And concerning this, in which my discourse should end and you should demonstrate your skill: when a large bone is broken, treat it upon the limb as you would the bone of the thigh or the arm and similar to those of larger limbs, and do not presume to pull or extract it, because often death results from that; let it be until it can set itself, for it often sets within 20 or 30 days; and then treat the wound if it seems appropriate, and if it does not set, leave it.
Chapter 20.
Of the treatment of the swelling that occurs at the site of any fracture.
Often this swelling occurs at the site of healing from a fracture, especially when close to the joints, and it distorts the shape of the limb; and it often hinders the limb's natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent, and apply medicines that have a styptic effect, such as alum, vinegar, myrrh, ceroc, and similar ones; use some or all of these, and mix them with wine, egg white, or vinegar, and place this mixture on the swelling with a bandage, binding it firmly.
And leave it bound tightly for several days; and then loosen it and reapply another, until the swelling is gone; or apply a lead sheet over it gently, for lead has the property of resolving any swelling in the limbs.
However, if the swelling has hardened and become tight, and it is necessary to remove it forcefully, then cut it open at its most prominent part, and remove the excess and prominent part, or cut it with some instruments until it is removed; and treat the area until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the restoration of a fracture when it is restored and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, not according to its natural strength.
When a fractured bone is restored, and afterward the limb remains weak and frail, this is due to several causes: one of which is the excessive loosening of the ligaments and their binding not being done correctly; or by excessive tightness of the ligaments that prevents nourishment from reaching the limb; or due to excessive application of poultices; or by unnecessary movement not at the appropriate time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and by their weakness.
And the cure for this is to feed the patient and make their body tender until blood is replenished; and administer baths; and introduce cheerfulness and joy.
And then place a poultice on the limb, so that the poultice draws more nourishment to it, or continue applying warm water poultices until nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of broken bones when they are improperly set and prevent the operation from being as it should be.
When, after the limb has been set, there is still a crookedness, prominence, or bump on the broken bone, and this has changed the shape of the limb, but the limb's natural operation is not prevented, then you should not accept the word of someone who claims the limb is broken again.
But many foolish physicians and bone-setters have done this in our land; and this procedure is highly reprehensible, leading to great fear, the sign of which is death.
However, if the limping and swelling are recent, then they should be soaked in warm water in which softening herbs are steeped, such as elder leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar ones; and an emollient plaster should be applied, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage from elder root should be taken and mixed with hen's egg yolk or beeswax oil, and plastered with that; or fat figs should be taken, crushed with pigeon dung, and similar remedies for strengthening consolidation.
And sometimes it is dissolved by consistent gentle rubbing with wet hands, and movement of the limb should be administered in every direction at all times.
However, if the crookedness has progressed, becoming strong and stony, and requiring iron to be cured, then the pus must be stopped and the protruding bone dissolved.  This excess swelling on the bone itself must be cut away with sharp scalpels, and care and attention must be given to this process.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the treatment of dislocations.
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper place, preventing movement and causing the limb's shape to be distorted, bringing great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when an accident causes a dislocation, it is essential to try to reduce it immediately, and not delay its reduction, for if delayed, the area becomes inflamed and hard, making the reduction of the dislocation difficult.
And therefore, it is not advisable to move or stretch the limb during the inflammation, for often it causes spasms and prolonged pain.
But when this happens, you should apply a poultice to the inflamed area of the patient, and allow it to remain until the inflammation subsides; then the limb should be bathed in warm water and oil, and the dislocation reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated with this, so that the affected area returns to its proper place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation, following the precedent set for fractures; from the most prominent part of the body down to the lowest part.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated quickly, and the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their location and slightly softened; or they are completely and thoroughly dislocated, so that the joint is softened, saliva drips from the patient, the patient cannot retain it or cannot close their mouth, and the tongue is bound in the mouth.
However, when the dislocation is slight, it often returns on its own with little effort.
But if the dislocation is complete and thorough, then a gentle reduction must be administered immediately, and not delayed at all.
And the minister should hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert the fingertip of one hand into the area of the jaw dislocation inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of their hand should be outside, holding them steady; and command the patient to relax their jaw muscles and move it in each direction; and the physician should push the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then apply warm water and oil vapor to ease the reduction of both, and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And once they are returned and held in place, and the patient's mouth is closed and not sore, then place over those cloths powders of wax and oil; and let it be made of wax and oil mixed; and then be bound lightly with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be supported between two pillows, so that it does not tilt to the right or left side; and do not force them to chew anything; let their food be soft until the pains have subsided and the jaws have healed, then let them eat whatever they wish.
And this should be administered with ease, and do not put pressure on opening the mouth for eating, drinking, and speaking, until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws, when dislocated at any time and not returned to their places, often causes fevers and constant sweating, and the patient's belly is strongly affected, and there is considerable vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal; and often the one who experiences this dies within a few days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated inward from its connection with the foot; and sometimes it is dislocated outward, and this is apparent to the touch.
And the restoration of it is that the patient lies on their back and extends their arms. And then press the area with your palm with firm pressure, for it will return.
And then place a poultice and powders on that area and press it down.
But the extremity of that which sits on the thigh and is connected to it is not dislocated at any time; therefore, it must be reduced and held in place as we have said and as is appropriate for you.
And then apply a poultice, powders, and a bandage, and order the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of a muscle dislocation.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated in more than three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated to the upper part of the muscle, and this is done hard; and it is not dislocated to the rear parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the front parts by the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and comes out to the lower parts towards the upper part, and especially in those whose flesh is little, it is easily dislocated; but in those in which there is a lot of flesh, it is difficult to come out.
And often, accidents befall some men through blows or falls, and their muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is believed to be dislocated because of that.
Then you should verify this until you are absolutely certain, and then proceed with the treatment of it.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is in the lower parts towards the top; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, because you find a clear difference between them; and you find a cavity at the head of the muscle, and below the top, near the touch of the head of the muscle, just like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
If it is dislocated towards the feet or above, and you then find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
And a slight reduction of this dislocation is made when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises the patient's hand to the upper parts; and then places your fingers below the patient's armpit, and lifts the joint with strength to its place, and the minister raises the patient's hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it below where it will easily return to its proper position.
But if, despite what we have said, it does not return, and it has been a considerable time since the dislocation occurred, then the patient should be bathed in hot water and given an application that softens and smooths, like a decoction of roots of althea, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and that should be applied.
And then the patient should be placed on their back, and under their armpits placed a wool sphere that is balanced between lightness and firmness, and then the physician places their heel on the sphere, and elevates the head of the muscle with force, and pulls the patient's hand so that it is not moved downward, and another minister holds the patient's head, so it is not moved downward, so that it will quickly return to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this way: have a man present who is taller than the patient, and have him stand on the affected side, and let him place his arm under the patient's armpit and lift the patient's arm upward until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the patient's hand from the lower part of their stomach. But if the patient is light, then something else should be suspended with them, so that it adds weight, for the dislocation will return quickly.
And it is easily reduced by another method: a long wooden post, round like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, is placed on the ground, under the patient.  Then, heavy cloths are placed on the top of the post, and the patient stands along the length of the post. The patient's hand is then extended towards the opposite side, and their body is pushed forcefully in the opposite direction, so that the joint quickly returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult due to all the causes we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a stick whose length is two arms long, and its width is four fingers wide, and its thickness is slightly narrowed at the armpit in this way:
And heavy cloths should be tied to the round top so that the post does not injure the patient.
And then, place the post under the patient's armpit, and extend their hand or arm along the post towards the lower parts, and tie the post to the arm and the hand.
Then, the arm should be placed on a ladder rung according to its width, and the hand extended downward, and the other side of the body suspended to the other side, so that the joint quickly enters into place.
And when the reduction is completed in any way possible, you should place a thick layer of wool under the armpit; then apply a prepared plaster of ground powder, ashes, and egg white to all the surrounding muscle, wrapping it around; afterwards, bind the armpit with a suitable bandage.  The bandage should be wrapped around the plaster, and the patient's hand should be tied to the neck.  Leave it undisturbed, and do not move the hand for seven days.
And the patient's diet should be light until the limb is strengthened, as this aids in their recovery.
And then, the diet should be increased after seven or five days, and the affected part should be exercised; and if it is firm and not swollen, then it is healed.
But if the joint has been dislocated multiple times due to moisture or another cause, then a cautery with three punctures, as described earlier in the chapter on cauteries, must be administered.
And if all this is done, and after seven days the bandage and joint are not firm, and the plaster and bandage are removed several times, and it is still not firm, and the arm cannot be raised to its usual position, then understand that the nerves within the muscle are severed, stretched, or swollen, and that the joint will never be fully restored.
For dislocations of the foot, nipple, or back areas, reduction is achieved by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to place.
And another bandage should be applied, and treat it until it is healed.
And if after healing, there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths frequently until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original condition.
Chapter 27.
Of the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and more so in the front than the back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is evident from looking or touching, whatever the configuration of the dislocation; and when you adjust the dislocated elbow with your hand, this is evident to you, for the joint is hollow and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its muscle.
And you should act quickly, and reduce the dislocation before it becomes chronically inflamed, for if it becomes chronically inflamed, the reduction is difficult, and the limb may not be completely healed; and especially when it is in the back part, for it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and causes more pain, and often results in death.
And the restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's arm should be extended with two hands, and the patient's arm outstretched, and the physician's hands are on the elbow and below it, and he pushes the joint with the fingertips of his hands together, or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front, then it returns by bending the arm with his hand, until he strikes the elbow with the base of his palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous extension and very strong force.
And it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and hold that extension, so that it is not pulled back against the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, since it is wrapped in a folded cloth long over his hand, or bandage.
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that these things aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease; and then push the joint with vigorous pressure until it returns.
And after the reduction, it is necessary to place a poultice on it containing astringent and dried egg white, and bind it tightly downwards, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left for several days.
And then it should be loosened; and if the joint is in its proper place, then you loosen the bandage and leave it.
And if you see the joint not properly tightened, then you repeat the poultice and the bandage, and leave it for several days until it is tightened; and then loosen it.
But if during the reduction of the joint, the condition is still moving, then administer moistening by bathing and gentle rubbing, and compression, until it is relieved; or place upon the joint a soft, oily substance; and then bandage it and leave it on the limb day and night. And then remove that, and place it in a bath; and when it is softened, then you rub the joint with moderate rubbing, and then repeat the application of soft oil, once, and a second time, and a third time. with intermittent bathing, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place over that a warm, damp cowhide, bandaged tightly; and do this several times, for this is moist and helps return it to its proper position.
Chapter 28.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the arm, that is, of the joint between the arm and the hand.
Dislocation of the hand sometimes occurs, and the reduction of its dislocation is relatively easy. The opposite is true for other joints, however, speed is needed in reducing it at the time of dislocation, before the area becomes inflamed or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the patient's hand joint on a table, and the assistant extends the patient's hand, and the physician places his hand or palm over the prominence of the joint, and pushes until it returns to its place.
However, it is necessary to consider if the palm is already turned towards the back of the hand, in which case the patient places the back of their hand on a table during the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is located on the back of the hand, then the patient's hand should be positioned palm-up on the table, so that the physician's hand can be placed over the prominence of the joint.
And so, if it returns quickly, all is well; and if not, then firmly hold it with a bandage to prevent an abscess and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, you will not endure nor succeed in reducing it after several days have passed.
However, if the joint remains twisted, and you find no cause for the patient's ailment, only that the hand is weakened and cannot grip anything, then know that the nerves are severed or damaged.  In such a case, there is no remedy but to cauterize firmly near the injury, and this will provide some relief.
Therefore, once the ailment is corrected, apply the bandage we have described, and let it remain bound for five days; then loosen it and leave it, and exercise the patient's hand.
However, if the movement is restricted and you find some heaviness in the area, then alleviate it with warm water and some friction several times, until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
Of the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in various directions.
And when any of these fingers is dislocated towards the palm side or the underside of the finger, then straighten the finger and push the dislocation away from you with your fingers, until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger and suspend it over the part to which it was dislocated, and leave it there for two days.
And then suspend and extend it until it is properly aligned in its place.
And when it is night, bind it according to this narration, and do not cease to loosen it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night.  Do this for several days until it is straight.
And do the same if it is dislocated toward the underside of the hand, and bind it to that side and perform your initial procedure until it is healed.
And similarly do this for dislocated areas elsewhere.
Chapter 30.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae.
When a complete dislocation of any of the spinal vertebrae in the back or neck occurs, and the dislocated vertebrae remain out of place, there is no cure in that case, for death awaits the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's bowel movements are involuntary and they cannot control them; and often some of the patient's limbs are paralyzed, or two legs, or two arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is out of place, for often it is out of place and the removal of it is done in four ways.
Therefore, this is now displaced behind and is called a "gibbous" condition.
But the treatment of this is that one should consider if the gibbosity happened during childhood, for then there is no cure, nor a complete healing.
However, for that which comes about by accident or impact or similar causes, the ancients described methods of treatment at great length, from which the most benefit can be derived; but I shall now shorten that, avoiding unnecessary details, for the sake of clarity and conciseness in my presentation, with which I have explained and organized this, drawing on various instruments, with which I will demonstrate and elucidate this.
And of those, only the one that occurs on the back itself is cured by what I am recommending.
And it is necessary that the patient be laid face down on a soft, padded surface close to a wall, and be supported underneath with soft padding so that the patient's foot is not injured.
And then a straight piece of wood should be placed, fixed into the ground at the end of the padded surface near the patient's head, and another piece of wood positioned under the patient's feet at the other end of the padded surface.
And one attendant should hold the first piece of wood, and it should not be buried in the ground; and another attendant should hold the other piece of wood in a similar manner.
And then wrap a bandage around the patient's head and secure it tightly underneath the temples; and extend the end of the bandage to the piece of wood situated near their head, and tie it there; then firmly secure another bandage around their hips, covering their thighs and legs; and finally, connect all the bandages and tie them to the other piece of wood situated near their feet.
And then each attendant should extend the bandage to the corresponding piece of wood, and the two pieces of wood and the bandages should not be moved from their current positions, however, they should not be fastened as we have described.
And the physician should place their palms upon the spine with force until it returns to its normal position, or that a board is placed beneath the spine, and then adjust the patient's feet onto the board until they return to a normal position.
But if it does not return in this way, then take a board whose width or length is approximately three arms' lengths, and make a cavity in the wall, mentioned previously as being near the patient, into which the end of the board can be placed. And then place the middle of the board on the spine, and the physician places their feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is straightened and returns to its proper position.
And if you wish, open the wound with a turn that is turned by the hand; and you should place in the ground, behind the patient's head, two pieces of wood, each one arm's length long, and, behind the patient's feet, also two similar pieces of wood; and the space between each pair of pieces of wood should be a palm's breadth.  A hole should be made in each piece of wood through which the turning tool can pass, and each should be firmly fixed in the ground so as to prevent movement.
And place a round rod on which the turning tool is located, and let it turn within the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And on the end of the rod is a hole into which the turning tool fits, its length being a palm's width.  A similar arrangement is made in the other two pieces of wood.
And then tighten the bindings you have placed on the patient's feet, in the hole located towards the head, and the bindings you have placed on their thighs, in the turn located toward the feet.
And then, near each turn, there should be a helper who turns the turning tool with their hand, while the physician adjusts the vertebra as we have described.
And after the vertebra is returned and the area is adjusted, then apply a thick plaster with egg white, and afterwards, a bandage.  Then place a board splint on the plaster, whose width is about three fingers, and its length sufficient to cover the affected area of the vertebra.
And then bind it with the bandage we have described, and have the patient use subtle nourishment until they are healed.
And if any lingering issue remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then medicines that soften and cleanse the area through long-term use, as we have recounted, must be administered; and a lead lamina is also to be administered to that location.
And sometimes a problem occurs in the back of the spinal vertebrae, and is worsened by that dislocation;  and that is the bone that is displaced, for which it is not appropriate to use this medicine, because it could lead to death.
Chapter 31.
Of the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint are only subject to dislocation, and not to the issues affecting other joints, such as small movements and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inward, or outward, or forward, or backward.
And it is more commonly dislocated inward, and less so forward or backward.
A sign of a dislocation inward is that when you align the patient's healthy leg with the injured one, the affected leg is longer and the knee is more prominent than on the healthy side, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards the shin (because of) the affected shin being inflamed with a hot abscess, as the hip head has settled there.
The sign of a dislocation outward is that the symptoms are opposite to this one.
A sign of a forward dislocation is that the patient stretches their leg fully but cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if forced to go forward, cannot move forward; and their urination is retained, and their shin is inflamed, and they walk on their heel.
A sign of a backward dislocation is that the knee does not extend, nor can it be bent forward to bend the shin, and the leg is shorter than the other, and the shin is softened, and the hip head is towards that place.
However, the reduction of these types of dislocations is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and ancient, already impacted by the passage of time, then you apply reduction to it, and it remains in its position; then there is no complete cure for it; and then, no presumption should be made in that regard.
But in the case of a recent dislocation, one of the four types of dislocations, then you try to return the joint and extend it in the inside and outside directions, and move it to the right and left, for a strong thrust brings it back, and you need no other treatment.
However, if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare strong instruments and extend the leg from the lower part, either with your hands or with a bandage tied above the knee; and another person should extend the upper hand, so that they put their hands under the patient's armpits; and then apply a strong bandage around the hip, and another person should hold the bandage's end.
And the extension should be either from the inside of the shin to the crotch area, or from the back to the back.
And perform the extension in all of these directions until the patient is lifted from the ground by their body weight and hangs suspended.
And this type of extension is a common method for all four [types].
And if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then for all cases, it is necessary to speak of the proper treatment.
In the proper reduction of a dislocation, when it is dislocated internally, the patient should be placed on their right side; then apply bandages to the root of the thigh, in the area between the thigh bone's head and the area beneath the groin; and then extend the bandage over the area of the groin to the highest part of the crotch.
And another strong assistant should take the patient's arms, firmly grasp the thick part of the affected thigh, and extend it outward forcefully, for this will return it to its place.
And this type has an easier cure, with which this limb is reduced than other types.
But if you are excused and do not comply with this type of treatment completely, then the patient's two feet must be bound together with a strong, light bandage, around both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each be about four fingers' width, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by two fingers' width.
And then the patient should be suspended over the top of a post, and be in the house; and let the distance from the ground be about two arms' lengths.
And then command a strong young man to hold the head of the thigh, and let another young man hold the patient, and the other young man, holding the thigh with strength, should push, for the joint will return to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, the patient should lie on a stool, as we have recounted in the event of a sprain; and let the bandage be tightened on the affected leg and on the patient's foot.
Then two posts should be placed, one at the patient's feet and the other at the head; and then posts fitted together in the middle of the hill should be placed, over which wet cloths should be wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the post is between their thighs, to prevent the extension to the lower parts from being pulled.
And then each attendant should extend their part, and the physician with his hand will guide the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be slightly extended, and it is according to this same description on a hill; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the dislocated limb, and then holds it with the other hand, and with this holding, he extends the lower parts to the front of the joint.
And if the dislocation is in the rear parts, then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended downwards, but elevated from the ground; it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, as is the case with a raised position if their thigh is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about the patient lying on two cushions; and it is on his side, and the ligaments should be extended as we have stated, not much.
And pressure should be applied with a board over the area where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is complete—and the sign of the reduction is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend both legs of the patient, and when you see them aligned and the patient clenches his leg and expands it without excuse, then know that the limb is returned as required—and then you bring the two thighs together and place a poultice and bind it so that the thigh is not moved in any direction; and keep the patient at rest for three or four days.
Then loosen the ligament and poultice, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them aligned properly, then know that the dislocation is now fixed, and then release the patient.
And if you see any cause for softening, then you return and apply a poultice to that, and bind it according to your first binding, and leave it for three days.
And then loosen that, and have the patient walk slowly for some days, until it is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, but not backwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that, if you tell the patient to apply their leg with the thigh, then you know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration in all these ways is that you should make the patient lie on their back, so that they extend their leg as much as possible; place your two hands on their side, and place the patient's foot between your feet; and then press the patient's knee with your palms, and hold them tightly between your fingers on the knee with strength, and another helper should extend the leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reposition is that their leg will adhere to the thigh with effortless ease.
Then plaster it and hold the leg close to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for several days, until they are healed and strong.
But if reduction by you is unnecessary, then administer strong extension with ligaments, as described in the treatment of the hip previously.
Chapter 33.
Of the treatment of the dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle is sometimes dislocated by a small movement, and sometimes dislocated completely, and its dislocation is either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that the ankle often swells on the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment for a small displacement is a gentle return, and it is to be extended easily with the hands and pressed until it returns to its place.
However, in treating a complete dislocation, you must have the patient lie straight, and have a strong and able assistant stand behind the affected leg, in the middle of the afflicted area.
Then you, with your right hand, take hold of the foot at the highest part, and with your left hand, the lowest part of the foot, at the ankle's location.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left, twice, then extend with the left; and push the foot's ankle with the right toward the leg without effort.
And do this twice, as we have counted.
And then push the ankle of the foot toward the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
So if it returns in one or two attempts in this manner, and if you see the foot is straightened, it is good; and if not, then repeat the procedure, for it [the foot] has not returned.
But if you are prevented from reducing it with what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and place a firmly fixed pillow on the ground, and position it between their thighs, and you have already draped them over with a cloth so that the patient is not injured.
And then the patient's attendant holds their thighs, and another attendant extends the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied around the foot's joint; and then each attendant extends it against the extension of their partner, and the pillow is positioned between the patient's thighs, holding it, so that the patient's body is not pulled towards the parts below their extension.
And then the physician straightens the dislocation with their hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh at the lower parts, for the dislocation returns with ease.
And so when the dislocation returns and its successful reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it firmly with bandages, and bandage the foot to the leg.
And you should be wary of the nerves located behind the heel, so that the bandage over them is not forceful and harms them severely.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage has softened, tighten it.
And then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from activity for 40 days. However, if the patient is forced to move about before that period, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not be further dislocated and damaged, and thus receive no cure.
And if an abscess occurs, then you should apply to it what we previously described in another location for healing and poulticing, until it is resolved.
Chapter 34.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the toes of the feet.
It is necessary that the dislocated part be gently put back in place without effort; and this is not difficult, but rather easy.
But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the foot, then it is necessary to have the patient place their foot on a soft surface, like the ground or a table, and remain in that position as if they were walking.
And you, stand beside it, and place your foot on the area where the joint protrudes, and then press on it with your foot with gentle force until it returns to its place, and you see it fully seated and no longer appearing in the protruding position.
And then place a board beneath the sole of their foot that covers the entire foot, with two ends, and firmly and decently bind this with a bandage for three days; and then release it and keep them from walking for several days, until the healing is strong and the repositioning is secure.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that are caused by blows or fractures, or both.
When any of these causes occur, and you exert yourself greatly in the treatment and restoration of the patient, death often results.
Therefore, one should not presume to treat such cases, but only those skilled in the art, with long experience, compassionate and merciful, slow, not rash or presumptuous; and who initially uses only medicines to ease painful inflammations, and leave the patient to divine judgment, except in cases where one hopes for recovery from death, with alleviation of the illness, and where some hope appears. Then strive to perform the reduction as soon as possible after the cause, before a severe inflammation develops.
And if the limb returns as desired, then administer a regimen that relieves the inflammation and treats the wound with whatever drying ointments are appropriate.
And if a dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the bones are separated, then you must treat the separation, and do in this case what we have said concerning simple illnesses of the preceding parts of these.
And, according to your ability, avoid that which leads to fear in the ways, as my teaching has led you; for this is better for you from your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more healthful for your true body in your time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, perfectly, of whom may God be blessed. Amen.
