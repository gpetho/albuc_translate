 CHAPTER EIGHTY-TWO.
On the treatment of corns, inverted and otherwise, and dry warts and pimples.
 A corn is a round knob, the same colour as the body and resembling the head of a nail.
It occurs in all parts of the body but particularly in the soles of the feet and the toes, whence arises pain in walking.
You should cut away what is round the corn and take it with forceps or a hook and tear it out by the root; then dress it.
If you wish you may cauterize it in the manner already described in the book on cauterization.
Then concerning dry warts: a wart is a little round rough compact eminence on the surface of the body; it occurs often on the hands of boys.
Now the treatment is to draw out the wart and cut if off; or tie it off with a silken thread or a hair until it falls out; or if you wish, cauterize as said before, either with the actual cautery or with caustic.
Sometimes warts, inverted or otherwise, are uprooted with the instrument I shall describe under the treatment of pimples.
 A pimple is also a little compact thick prominence on the skin surface, going deep; when it gets cold there is a feeling as of an ant's sting in it.
It is found all over the body but mostly on the hands.
The treatment is to take the quill of a strong feather of the goose or the vulture, and place the quill over the pimple so as to encircle it with the circumference of the tube; then revolve the quill with your hand so as to cut all round the pimple, and go deep into the flesh, and then the pimple may be drawn out by the roots.
If you wish you may extract it with a tube of bronze or of iron, of this form.
The upper closed part of the tube should be fine, solid, and twisted, to give easy purchase for the fingers in holding and revolving it.
If you wish you may cauterize the pimple as described earlier on the cauterization of warts in the book on the cautery.
