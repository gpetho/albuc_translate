On Albather, which occurs in the foreskin and head of the penis, and on decay, discoloration, and adhesion.
Chapter 56.
Often, these Albather occur on the penis, and it is a growth of foul flesh.
And of these, some are malignant, and others are not malignant.
Therefore, for the non-malignant one, it is necessary to suspend it with a fine hook and cut it off until you completely remove it.
Then place a piece of cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment over it.
Then treat it afterward with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
But if the Albather is malignant and of foul color, then it is necessary to apply cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
However, if the Albather is in the foreskin of a captive, not circumcised, and part of the Albather is within the foreskin and part outside: then it is necessary to remove the Albather that is inside first, so that when it heals, then you treat the outside; for if you treat it all at once, the foreskin will not be secured without being perforated.
And discoloration and decay also occur in the testicles and foreskin.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to scoop out everything that is discolored and is decaying or has already decayed.
Then rub over it afterward with honey that has been mixed with the flour of pomegranate peels and sifted ground herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatments until it heals.
But if bleeding occurs, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery, in this manner.
Cautery is indeed helpful for two conditions at once, namely, for bleeding and when a wound is decaying.
But if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed quickly, then it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra so the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion occurs only in someone whose foreskin is intact and who does not require circumcision, and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or ulcer: it is therefore necessary to scrape it with a blunt spatula until the connection is released and the head of the penis is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to separate them precisely, then it is necessary to scrape a bit from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
This is because when the foreskin is thin, it may easily be perforated due to its delicacy.
Then separate the foreskin and head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water, so they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine until it is healed.
