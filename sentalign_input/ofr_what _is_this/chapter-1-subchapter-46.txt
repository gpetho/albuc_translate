of old pain in any limb
When pain comes in a limb, either from a fall or a blow, and this pain lasts a long time, and medical treatment is of no use, then it must be cauterized with the cautery which is called "points," and the cauterization should be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and weakness and its strength and location of the twisting pain.
If he is healed from the first cauterization, that's good; if not, repeat another cauterization over it, because it is customary that it should move to the limb that is nearest to it, so you must do the cauterizations until the patient is healed.
