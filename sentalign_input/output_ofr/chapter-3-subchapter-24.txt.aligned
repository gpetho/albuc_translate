of the jaws It rarely happens that both jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two ways: either they are slightly out of place and somewhat softened; or they are completely dislocated, and hang down toward the chest, and saliva runs from the mouth which he cannot hold, nor can he close his mouth, and he mumbles his speech.	It is rare indeed for the jawbones to be dislocated. Their dislocation may be in one of two ways: either they may shift slightly from their place and be a little relaxed; or they may be completely and utterly dislocated so as to be relaxed down toward the breast so that the patient's saliva runs out and he cannot control it; nor is he able to close his mouth, and he stutters in speaking.	0.90749216
When the dislocation is minor, it returns by itself in many cases.	If it be only a slight displacement it will go back in most cases spontaneously without much trouble.	0.6703801
And if it is complete and total, you must reduce it quickly, and do not delay; and in such a way that the assistant holds the patient's head, and the surgeon puts the bag of one of his hands at the root of the jaw dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on both sides; and the other two fingers are outside, to apply even pressure; and tell the patient to relax his jaws, and to move them in all directions.	But if the dislocation be complete and total it is necessary to set about the reduction of it at once without any delay. This is done thus: an assistant holds the patient's head and the doctor introduces into his mouth the thumb of one hand at the root of the jaw, if it be a dislocation on one side, or both thumbs if it be a bilateral dislocation, with the rest of the fingers outside to keep it straight.	0.8150343
And the surgeon sets it evenly, until it returns to its place.	Then let him bid the patient relax his jaws and allow them to move in any direction; while the doctor sets the dislocation, thrusting the jaw until it return to its proper place.	0.5479976
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then moisten them with warm water and oil, until you reduce them easily; and do not delay in reducing them, as we have said.	If the reduction be difficult, especially if it be a bilateral dislocation, administer a fomentation with hot water and oil, so that the reduction of both sides may be facilitated. And on no account delay the reduction, as we have said.	0.8270956
And when they are reduced evenly, and the patient's mouth closes well without difficulty, then apply cloths soaked in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages; and let the patient sleep on his back, and his head be placed between two cushions, so that he does not move it to the right or left, and does not try to chew, but takes light food, until the pain is gone, and the jaws are strengthened; and then chews what he wants lightly, and does not strain to open his mouth to eat and drink, until the jaw is well strengthened and healed.	When the reduction and straightening have been done and the patient's mouth closes and is not relaxed, then apply to both sides dressings steeped in wax prepared from wax and oil of roses. Then bind it up gently, with a loose bandage. The patient should sleep lying on his back with his head held between two pillows so that he does not move it either to right or to left; nor should he burden himself with chewing but should be on a diet of broth of corn starch until the pain is gone and the jaw is firm; then he may eat whatever he wishes. Let him use it gently; let him not work his mouth heavily in eating or drinking or yawning until the jaw is firmly knit and healed.	0.91903543
And if the two jaws cannot be reset at the same time, and are not returned to their places, fevers and sudden chills usually occur, and perhaps diarrhea, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.	If the reduction of both sides is hard when it is a simultaneous bilateral dislocation, and there is no return to the proper position, then thereby in many cases fevers and perpetual headaches occur; sometimes the patient's belly is loosened and he vomits actual bile.	0.7271733
And when you see this, then know that it is a dangerous situation; and often the one to whom it happens dies within nine days.	When you see this you will know that he is doomed; in most cases in which this happens death follows in ten days.	0.82857203
