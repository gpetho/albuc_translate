On the method of cauterizing in cases of Tortura.
Chapter VII.
The tortura treated with cauterization is only one of the conditions that arise from phlegm, as we said in the divisions of ailments.
And avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of tortura with syrups, head purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize the patient in three places: one at the root of the ear, the second a little lower near the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the side opposite the weakened area.
For the relaxation does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
And the procedure for cauterization is to cauterize him with the cautery directly below the upper end of the ear near the horn of the head a little; and another at the temple, the length of which is the length of a thumb.
And place your hand down with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, which is a type of knife, whose shape was previously shown; however, it is a bit less delicate, as you see, and it should be slightly thicker than necessary.
Then treat the locations with the same treatment as before until they heal.
