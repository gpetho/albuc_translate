When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with snuff, and squeeze her mouth and nose with your hands;
and if it comes out that way, that is good.
If not, take a pot, make a hole in the lid, and put herbs in it that can open the mouth of the uterus, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia wood, and centaury;
all these herbs, or some of them, are cooked in water in the pot over the fire; then put one end of a tube into the hole of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the uterus,
and hold it until the vapor reaches the uterus; then make her sneeze, as we have said.
The afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand with sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage, and then insert it into the vagina,
and search for the afterbirth; and when she finds it, let her take it and gently stretch it straight, so that the uterus does not fall during extraction;
but she must move it gently to the right and left, then pull; it will come and detach.
And if the mouth of the uterus is already narrowed, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing and fumigating with herbs;
and if it does not come out after all that we have said, be careful not to pull recklessly;
but what is at the mouth of the uterus must be tied to the womanâ€™s thigh, then give her a clyster with tetrapharmacum ointment;
it will rot and detach, and come out; but always, when it rots, there will be a bad smell to the stomach and the head, and harm the patient.
So suitable fumigations are necessary: some of the ancients have tried fumigation with watercress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated for retained menses and afterbirth is this:
It is glass, similar to a tube, with the thin end inserted into the vagina, and the wide end over the fire;
and the fumigation is done over coals, and hold it until it is done, then start another.
