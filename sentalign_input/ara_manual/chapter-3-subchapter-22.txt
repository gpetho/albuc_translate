Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of fractured bones if they are set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
If, after a limb has healed, a crookedness or a protrusion of the fractured bone appears, or a knot, and the form of the limb is therefore ugly.
However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, you should not accept the opinion of someone who claims to break the limb from the top, as many ignorant doctors and bone-setters do in our country. 
This practice is very reprehensible and leads to great dangers, the least of which is permanent damage. However, if the crookedness and knot are soft, it should be poulticed with water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and root, melilot, and the like.
It should be dressed with softening bandages, such as expertly made diachylon, or the mucilage of marshmallow root may be taken and mixed with chicken fat and fresh butter and applied as a dressing, or ripe figs may be pounded with pigeon dung and similar medications that are called resolvents.
The knot may also be resolved with constant gentle massage with the hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times.  If the crookedness is old and severe, and hardened, and the necessity arises to treat it with iron.
It should be incised above and the connection of the bone released, and the excess knot or bone should be cut with fine cutters, and gentleness should be used in this with great effort and care. Then the wound should be treated as mentioned previously until it heals.
