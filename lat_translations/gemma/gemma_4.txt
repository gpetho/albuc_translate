Praefatio.	Prefatory.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have finished with you, my son, this book which is the last of my works on medicine, completed with its end in view, following the explanations and affirmations of this treatise, I wish to complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery with the hand is now abandoned in our time and is a private matter: until perhaps its science is lost and its practice has ceased, except for brief notices in ancient books, which have been altered by the hand: and there have happened to be mistakes and hesitation, until its intentions have been closed and its purpose prolonged: I have deemed it necessary to provide this treatise with an orderly arrangement of its contents, according to its position and affirmations, and with brevity: and to include the forms of instruments, such as the Cautery and other implements, with their specifications and their preparation which is necessary
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	However, because a skilled artisan of this sort is not to be found easily in our time with his hand: for the art of medicine is long, and the author must exercise himself beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen has said, until he knows the functions of the limbs, their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has an understanding of the bones, nerves, and lacerations, and their number, and their exit, and the pulse of veins, and quietness, and the locations of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	For this reason Hippocrates said, "A name is much more than a name, and work is little, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have indeed mentioned this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For one who is ignorant of what we have said concerning anatomy will fall into error, and will endanger human life: as I have seen many who have learned this science carelessly and without study or experiment
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	Why is it that the doctor has secured the scrofula in the woman's neck with a stiff ligature, and has thereby obstructed some of the arteries in the neck? Because of this, blood flows from the woman until she dies in her hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And the doctor observed another one who had presumed to extract a stone from the bladder which was in the bladder, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He went to him and extracted it with the bladder's husk
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Because the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I too was called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who took hold of a certain Duke of our land because of medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, that he fractured his leg near the heel: and the doctor, with his ignorance, bound the fracture with vinegar and nails, and tight bands, and did not let the wound breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	And he died according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he sent him away for a few days, and gave him orders not to loosen the ligament: and he stood thus until the swelling of his leg had gone down, and his foot and leg, and came to an end
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called to him again: and I set about loosening the ligament: and there ensued peace, and he was freed from his pains
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	But indeed the corruption was confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So the corruption ceased to spread in the limb, until it died
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And the physician went to another, who had perforated the cancerous abscess: and it was ulcerated after days, until its malice was increased with the lord himself.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	For when a cancer is pure from melancholic humour, it must not be treated with iron in every case, except in a limb which can tolerate it, that it be entirely excised
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, my son, you must know that an operation is divided into two parts: that which is associated with health, and that which carries risk in various situations
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	I am grieved in every place of this book where an operation is mentioned, where fear and terror are present.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore you must be cautious of this, and be restrained: lest they find fault with you, and speak dishonestly
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Receive therefore with humility and protection, and the sick with facility and firmness, and use the better way that leads to greater glory to God concerning the preservation of life and the obtaining of praise: and banish the terrifying diseases which are difficult to cure: and take away from your soul that which makes you fear, so that there may be no obstacle to your faith and your comfort
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For there remains for you a greater glory in your faith, and a sublimity in this world, and finally in the number of your souls.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You do not heal a bad disease: do not speak of a bad physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have indeed divided this treatise into three chapters
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Of cautery with fire, and of cautery with acute medicine, a chapter, and ordered from the head down to the feet, concerning the forms of instruments, and of materials for cautery: and everything which is necessary for the operation
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Concerning incision and perforation, phlebotomy and packing, wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and things of that kind: and the whole of this chapter, arranged in order of the instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and things of that kind: this chapter is arranged from the head to the feet, and concerning the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory be to God.

Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning the application of bandages, and the use of cautery: and in what complexions it is suitable, and when: and if with iron, or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before any operation is performed, it is necessary to state the qualities of the bandages and instruments to be used: and in what complexion they should be displayed
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the discourse concerning the quality of the cautery instrument, and its name, is a lengthy, subtle, scientific, and occult discourse.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And it is said by many wise men in this matter, and they disagree among themselves: and indeed little is sufficient from their discourses, fearing the prolongation of the discussion
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that the cautery instrument is useful in all complexions, which is with material, and without material: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without material, and the dry complexion without material
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In the hot and dry complexion with material they disagree
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some indeed say that the cautery instrument is useful in these.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	Others argue that Cauterium is not suitable for carbuncles, which arise from heat and dryness, because fire itself is hot: and it is unsuitable to cure a hot and dry ailment with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	Others maintain that Cauterium is not suitable for any hot and dry carbuncles that occur in the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of a man with fire and moisten it, you find the body of a man to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	I too have heard from experience that this is true.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	It is true that it does not suffice simply to say that Cauterium is not suitable for carbuncles; for one must have studied Cauterium in its final exercise and become acquainted with the diversity of human complexions, the nature of ailments, their causes and their course.</start_of_turn>
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	With the other complexions there is no fear; and especially with cold and moist ailments.</start_of_turn>
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	I know that all physicians agree about this: and they do not deny the use of Cauterium in these matters.</start_of_turn>
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And indeed, the sons know that the secret of Cauterium with fire and its advantage over Cauterium with burning medicine lies in the fact that fire is simple, and its action does not extend beyond the part which is cauterized: and it does not harm any other connected part, except for a slight bruising.</start_of_turn
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	Burning medicine, however, extends its action to the parts surrounding the cauterized area: and sometimes it makes the healing of the ailment more difficult, and sometimes it even brings about death.</start_of_turn>
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the excellence of its substance, does not make this [surgery] ill, unless it be excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Fire, however, by reason of its subtlety and the excellence of its substance, does not make this [surgery] bad, unless it be excessive.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	Fire, however, by reason of its subtlety and the excellence of its substance, does not make this [surgery] bad, unless it be excessive. And although this is not mentioned in this book, I shall tell you a secret concerning fire which is useful for this operation and which is demonstrated by philosophers with reference to the expulsion of ailments from the body.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And behold, children, that even they [philosophers] disagree concerning the time when fire becomes a cautery, and they say that it is better to delay the time of the operation.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	I say also that cautery is useful at all times: for in every case the document becomes submerged in urine, which is attracted by the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	Above all, if the cautery is to be used for severe and sudden pains, which do not tolerate delay, for these are subject to the danger of an increase in evil which is greater than the slight damage done by the operation at a later time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	Do not be deceived by the minds of the vulgar or stupid physicians, who say that surgery is never necessary for ailments which are cured by cautery: for in this they are mistaken. Indeed, cautery alters the complexion and dries up humors which are the causes of these ailments.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Indeed, cautery surpasses medicine in speed of action, in the excellence of its operation, and in its gentleness: and it is possible that the ailment will be cured at some later hour according to the complexion of the patient, the location of the ailment, and the excellence of the operation itself. And this is effected in the body by the collection of superfluous humors which are evacuated by the cautery. And this is the reason why it brings about the healing of ailments which medicine cannot cure.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Acute pain in a few superabundant and humid parts, as in a burnt tooth, because of pain, and similar to it, is possible that it will not depart from there without pain.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this is in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	Indeed, it is right that the cauterism is the most recent of the medical arts, and that is why they do not believe that there is any healing that can be obtained by medicine, nor by anything else after the cauterism has been made.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the thing is contrary to that. The intention is not that the cauterism is the most recent of the medical arts, but when we administer methods of treatment in some ailment, and they do not confer that treatment: then we administer in the end the cauterism, and it confers: thus it is that the cauterism is the last thing, not according to the intention which the vulgar people and the multitude of the physicians understand
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients say that the cauterism with gold is better than the cauterism with iron: and they do not say this except because of the equality of the gold and the fineness of its substance: and they say that it does not form pus at the place of the cauterism
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But it is not absolutely so. For I myself have seen this to be the case, and I have found that it does not do this in some bodies without other things
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cauterism with the very thing is good, and better than with iron, as they say.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	But when you ignite the cauterism with fire from gold, you are not to declare that it is ignited according to its quantity, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches the cold and if you add to it more fire, it liquefies in the fire, and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the artificer depart from that to engage in this business? And because of this, the Cauterium with the iron is brought near and is more rapid and proximate to the operation from its upright position.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	I have also ordered this Chapter in Cauterium, according to the Chapters: and I have ordered them from the head down to the feet: so that they may perform whatever they wish from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	As to the manner of cauterizing the Head in the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter 2: Of the Head.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here the cauterization is done according to the lord of humidity and cold over the brain: because these two are the causes of swelling, and of the flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of the swelling of sleep, and of toothache, and of throat pain: and in general of all diseases which arise from cold, such as palsy, and swelling, and epilepsy, and apoplexy, and things like these from diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is as follows: when the patient is in good health, he should be evacuated at first with a purgative medicine which softens the head for three or four nights, according to the nature of the disease, and the age of the patient, and his habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to make a circular burn on his head with the lancet
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands square, so that you can place your hands on his chest
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger touches, that is the place where you must cauterize with the burn
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then take the Cauterium Olive: which has this shape
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it upon the marked place with the cautery, descending gradually, so that your hand may be gradually constricted, and you shall withdraw it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then draw your hand quickly, and grasp the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see any quantity of bone or cartilage or herbs, then draw your hand quickly.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with something else that is heated: until you see the bone which I told you of.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and drink it down with this sponge, and place it upon the place: and keep it there for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place upon it a sponge soaked in butter, and keep the flame over the place, until the eschar is consumed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents of four herbs, until it is healed
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	It has been said that the greater the wound remains open, the more pus will be emitted: which is better and more useful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some people say that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and let the Cautery remain in contact until something of the thickness of bone is charred
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it will be withdrawn after that which was scorched from the bone, and it will be cured
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary that the Cautery should remain until the very end, until it has left an imprint in the bone like a footprint, so that the bone will fall out, as it is like a woman's stylus made of a small letter: and they say that from this place vapor escapes from the head, and the wound will be healed in a long time
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then he cares until they are solidified.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	Neither of two species of cautery is useless in all people except in some in whom there is fear of excessive bleeding.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	Leave it [the cautery] and attend to the health of the patient. It is better for me like that.</start_of_turn>
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head grows weak from the continuity of its natural discharge: as we have seen in the rest of the limbs: and especially when the head of the patient is weak by nature: the first kind of cautery is most safe and better for me in this case, and I will work with it for the health of the patient.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	In the case of cauterizing the head in the pain of the whole head.</start_of_turn>
Caput III.	Head section III.</start_of_turn
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When in the whole head there occurs chronic pain: and it persists in the patient, and there is pus, and boils, and head-purgings, and oil, and application of these things.</start_of_turn
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if one kind of cautery has already been applied, as we have mentioned, and no other of these things has been added to it: then consider carefully.</start_of_turn
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the patient is strong by nature and not weak, and there is cold sweat: then cauterize with another kind of cautery under that little bit.</start_of_turn
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize over the whole horn of the head with that cautery, but do not pass through the skin, and uncover an amount of bone as we have mentioned.</start_of_turn

Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	The infirm one finds because of that pain which arises, and diverse from the pain of the other cauterizations of the head altogether.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	I say concerning this Cauterization: it must be that which cauterizes the horns of the head and the back of the head more finely, and which cauterizes the middle of the head more broadly.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Concerning the method of cauterization in hemianche, both with the medicinal unguents and with the iron
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When it happens in the part of the head that there is pain and swelling, or that the pain extends up to the eye, and it is evacuated with the physicians who moderate the head, and the rest of the treatment is administered as I have said in the discourse on the diseases of the head, and it does not suffice for that: then the cauterization in that case is done in two ways: either with an acute burning medicine or with the iron
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cauterization with the acute burning medicine is that, you take a tooth from another person and burn it, and you remove the bark from it, and you split its extremities from both sides
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then split the place of the pain in time with a wide phlebotomy, until there is under the skin in that place where the tooth is taken
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Introduce it there under the skin until it is hidden: then bind over it with a bandage of constriction of low tension, and leave it for fifteen hours. Then take out the dressing and leave it for two or three days. Finally put on a wet bandage over it which is immersed in butter, until the place heals. Then care for it with an unguent until it is healed
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth tractate, on the Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Burning the inside of the belly with iron is in this way.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Burning with iron is like this
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	It is called Clausais: for its head has the shape of a key, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle there is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then put it on the place and hold your hand: and move the iron slowly while applying pressure: and let the quantity which is enough to burn through the thickness of the skin be as much as half of its size
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned and the blood flow does not increase
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the area in salt water, and put it on the place, and leave it for three days: then put the area with butter: afterwards care with unguents until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	If necessary, burn the haemorrhoids with the second extremity of the knife according to the Cauterization technique.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	Burn from the incision of the artery in this haemorrhoid, not from the old way directly.

When treating haemorrhoids, with all that has been said about the treatment of ailments, and when the cure has not taken hold: and when the pain persists, and the ailment has not been overcome by the cautery with medicine or with fire, then it is necessary to burn the haemorrhoids with the knife until they become white when there are signs of pain along a line whose length is half the digit, or almost like that: then take your hand away from the area with one hand, and hold the area firmly until the artery is cut through, and keep it that way until bone is reached.

Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, the cautery should touch the edge of the wound: then clamp the edges of the wound with forceps so that they do not move until they have healed.</start_of_turn>

When this happens, and you wish to write, if the after-eruption is in the liver itself, or in its covering: if it is in the liver itself, there is severe pain and swelling without acute pain: and if it is in the covering of the liver, with acute pain there is also swelling: and know that I am commanding you to go away, because it fatigues the physician of its care
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary therefore that the patient lies down on his belly
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the figure of the place of the after-eruption with the cautery: then you will apply the cautery which is assimilated by the heat.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with this knife once, until the whole skin is consumed, and it reaches the spleen, until the whole body is healed: then take care of the after-eruption, until the patient is healed
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	Neither should any instrument of the cauterizing kind be used without thorough study in the art of medicine: for by means of such study the disorders mentioned above will concur with experience on numerous occasions.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	It is better to omit it than to risk damaging it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterization in the chest
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 1
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients say that cauterization with aristolochia roots is used for a cold pleurisis in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is to be taken that from the dry roots of aristolochia one should take a single long root which is taken from it and be as thick as a finger
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse the root in oil: and kindle the same in fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery that is between the continuation of the collarbone and the jugulum, and with two small cauteries under guidance slightly bent downwards to the part which is under the beard
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs bent downwards to the rear: and a third cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between two ribs: and two cauteries from both sides of the chest, the lower cautery which is between two ribs
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	Neither must you touch your hand with the cautery, but let it be evident that the skin is fragrant.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient writers say that there are certain men who use a cautery like iron to burn: and they burn and throw it into that which is between the ribs, until it is consumed by it to the very bone, and comes out whole: as we said concerning the spleen
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear, for either the infirm dies immediately, or it happens that in the place of the fistula there is no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	In this way the cautery is to be used for the spleen head.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are treating a spleen ailment, when it is such that your treatment does not suffice for the healing of the ailment, then the cautery must be used in three ways, all of which are correct
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of them is to make three cauteries, or four in line, following the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the Liver
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every two cauteries the thickness of a finger, or less
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the mode of the cautery be equal to that which we said of the cautery of the Liver
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	Do not touch your hand with the cautery: and let the infirm lie supine over his back
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	Another method of cautery is: to take two fingers and grasp the cautery as we said in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus: and raise the skin which is over the spleen, where the left elbow of the infirm lies: and raise the skin as much as the breadth of the body, so that the cautery falls along the length of the body
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two fingers with the flame upwards, until when the flame has pierced the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cautery: there will be four cauteries thus made
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery which has three fingers.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cautery after you have put it away: let it emit pus for several days: for this is better than any other remedy which has preceded it
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On how to cauterize in Hydropisi.
Caput XXXIII.	In the treatment of hydropisis, cauterize accordingly.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery must not be applied directly to hydropisis, but must be used with the asclitium tool.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating hydropisis with these methods of treatment, which we mentioned in the previous chapter, and the condition does not improve, then it is necessary to cauterize four times around the belly button, once on the stomach, once on the liver, and once on the spleen, and twice on the back between the vertebrae, and once on the chest and once on the abdomen: and the depth of the cautery should be equal to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then remove the cautery without delay, so that pus can be emitted over a long time
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	Do not remove the patient from treatment after the cautery: two intentions should be added together for this purpose. And it will quickly recover with the help of God
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery which is to be used for the uterus is like a claw: as we have previously described. And that which is to be used for the back is like an olive tree, as we have previously described
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On how to cauterize the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	The chapter is not included in the provided text.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When the swelling subsides in hydropisis, and the area is filled with yellow water: it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot between the instep and the heel: grasp your hand with the cautery and do not twist it: then grasp your hand again: do not move it at all
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The yellow water will then rise up, and the cautery should be used in this shape
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make over two crura two cauteria on every limb, and apply the cautery with the extremity of the knife of the cautery: and make the cautery according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below the knee, approximately in the middle of the limb: and over every hip make two cauteria: and withdraw the cautery opened without care for a long time: so that it will dry up from it some water: then care for it with the rest which we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Then make over two incisions two cauteria on every limb, and apply the cautery with the tip of the knife: and make the cautery according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below the knee, approximately in the middle of the limb: and over every hip make two cauteria: and withdraw the cautery opened without care for a long time: so that it will dry up from it some water: then care for it with the rest which we have mentioned.
Caput XXXV.	Then make over two incisions two cauteria on every limb, and apply the cautery with the tip of the knife: and make the cautery according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below the knee, approximately in the middle of the limb: and over every hip make two cauteria: and withdraw the cautery opened without care for a long time: so that it will dry up from it some water: then care for it with the rest which we have mentioned.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the belly is from cold and moisture until the hardness of the retention and digestion is softened, which are in the stomach and intestines: and care for that with the methods of treatment, and do not cure it: and give the sick person the power to tolerate the excessive virtue of the cautery, then burn the belly itself with a large cautery over the stomach, according to what was previously said concerning the cautery of the circle, and four cauteries around the navel below the ribs, with a cautery of the navel itself: and a cautery over the fat above the buttocks, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if the liquid moistens the excessive, and the sick person tolerates it, then burn the belly itself with a cautery over the ribcage, and a cautery over all the intestines: and perhaps add two small cauteries over the stomach near the large one
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	There exists a proficient treatment whose application does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	There exists a proficient treatment whose application does not err.
Caput XXXVI.	There exists a proficient treatment whose application does not err.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the rectum are many old hemorrhoids, either one, and they are from gross, cold, or humid humors, they are cured when these things are used, as we said before, and do not require treatment: then cauterize three times with cautery over the lower part of the spine under the almonds in a triangular shape, and cauterize under the navel like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you think that its stomach is stiff, its food does not digest, and its face is pale, then cauterize it over the stomach with a large cautery, as before: and cauterize over the spleen and the other over the tailbone: and remove the open cautery at some other time. Then take care of it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.

Then take care of it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXXVII.	When you think that its stomach is stiff, its food does not digest, and its face is pale, then cauterize it over the stomach with a large cautery, as before: and cauterize over the spleen and the other over the tailbone: and remove the open cautery at some other time. Then take care of it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut away the anal fistula, then apply the cautery which is absorbed by the radix.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the fire into the cut fistula: and keep your last hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood runs: do this once or twice.</start_of_turn
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many boils, then cauterize each one individually as we have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them until they are healed, when the wound has closed with the discharge of the pus
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a great cautery over the boil, that is the last thing in its treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	In this way cauterize the fistula in the rectum.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the section and the work that we have said in its place, and returns from it, perhaps it will heal with cautery.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When there is any fistula, and it has become old, pus runs from it, and it softens the corrupted matter.</start_of_turn
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is proper that you should try with a fine needle.</start_of_turn
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the quantity of its depth with the needle.</start_of_turn
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then ignite the cautery, which is like a rod.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce yourself with the ignited cautery into the fistula and the quantity in which the thread has entered.</start_of_turn
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat over the cautery until you have burned all the corrupted bodies, once, or twice, or three times, according to the necessity.</start_of_turn
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And take care that there is no scorching of the nerve, if there is any, or great veins: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestines, then take care that you are not burned in those places.</start_of_turn
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	Do not do this except when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and think that it is not penetrating.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed and matters are excised from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then you know that it is already healed whole.</start_of_turn>
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	If they are not excised from it, matters, then you know that it is penetrating, or that its bone is corrupt, or as if from those things: of which recollection will come to its place.</start_of_turn>

When it happens in the reins that there is pain from cold or from great moisture, and they diminish because of that from which the patient is suffering, then it is necessary to cauterize them over the fat over the kidneys, cauterizing every kidney with a cautery needle, of which there is recollection.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize them a second time in the same fat.</start_of_turn
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Because three lines come.</start_of_turn
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore there will be four last things in the treatment.</start_of_turn

When there is weakness in the bladder, and softening from the stone and moisture, until the patient does not retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the belly above the bladder, where the hair of the testicles begins, and cauterize from the right side of the belly and from the left side of it: and let the length of that cautery be as much as the breadth of the thumb: and cauterize it with a lower burn, or with two burns, if you like: and let that be according as the cautery needle went before.</start_of_turn

When cold and moisture abound in the Matrix, and it is prohibited by this [moisture] from being impregnated, and its blood is corrupted, its periods are delayed, and there is pain at its side, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we have said concerning the cauterization of the uterus, and to cauterize above the lower edge of the liver, or to make two cauterizations: and let the cauterium be blunt.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	How to cauterize the Ancham in dislocation
Caput XLII.	How to cauterize the Ancham in dislocation
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When moisture of the mucous membrane flows down to the ankle of the Ancham and becomes the cause of its displacement from its place: and the sign of this is that the leg is prolonged over the other when compared with the limb below: and the place of dislocation is found in that hollow space.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the diseased part over the ankle of the Ancham with a circle: after you have marked the circumference with the cautery, as if you were rolling over: and that the ankle itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cauterium be of the form which was mentioned in the cauterization of the stomach
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If you do not find this cautery [for the ankle] previously mentioned, then cauterize it three times with a large olive cautery: and make the depth of the cautery equal to the amount of thickness of the skin of the whole body
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	How to cauterize in Sciatica
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the area of the knee, due to cold and moisture: the physician should treat the patient as we have said previously, and if no benefit results from this treatment, it is necessary to evacuate the patient from the humours with large pills of foetid material, or with artificial pills, and the like.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.</start_of_turn>
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of cauterization in this case is in two ways: either with cautery and astringents, or with fire.</start_of_turn>
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterization with fire is done in many ways.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of them is to cauterize over the knee with three triangular cautery instruments, according to this form.</start_of_turn
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And do it with a good depth, or a slight depth.</start_of_turn
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let there be space between every two cauteries equal to the thickness of a finger: and let the cauteries be small.</start_of_turn
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When the cauterization is done in the middle of the knee, it must be done cautiously.</start_of_turn
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	For there are four cautery instruments.</start_of_turn
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize in a circle, whose form precedes the cauterization of dislocation of the knee, do one: so that the circle contains the whole knee.</start_of_turn
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the hairiness of the whole skin.</start_of_turn
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the mode of cauterization in Sciatica, when the pain is attached to the knee itself, and does not extend up to the hip and thigh.</start_of_turn
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends up to the knee and thigh, then cauterize it with two cautery irons above the knee, above the place where the sick person has pain, where the pain is, and cauterize your cautery iron four digits above the heel to the outer side: and let the cautery iron be sharp.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	And if the patient complains that the pain extends up to near the toes, then cauterize it there where he complains with the cautery needle, three or four or more, as he needs it
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he complains that the pain is under the knee or thigh, then cauterize it there with one cautery iron.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And take care in all your cauterizations that you do not reach the nerves or great arteries, and that you do not pull on it over the patient's bad tissue, or cause contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	I also know of one and another who have cauterized above the heel, and have finished their cauterization, and the thigh has swollen, until the tumor has followed the foot down to the ground, and has burst open, and become corrupted throughout: then the solution of the belly has followed, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	And if the pain is in two parts together, cauterize both of them according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men say that the cautery of anchan is like this.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make like a wise man from iron, whose diameter is the middle of the palm: and let it be at the level of its orifice according to the thickness of the kernel of the thumb, or less wide: and there is to be within it the third of the same.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there shall be space between every two fingers according to the quantity of a thumb-node: and the fingers shall be opened by two parts: and the height of them shall be like a thumb-node, or two thumb-nodes: and make a handle of iron adapted to the palm of the hand.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn>
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is to be ignited in fire, until it is red, and the sparks are to be thrown away: then it is to be placed upon a wound covered with a soft cushion on the side of the healthy hand.</start_of_turn>

Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis saith, in this kind of cautery, or of the sons of men, we use it little, because of the fear of its appearance: and therefore, because of this, we find few who are willing to endure it.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	But truly it is from the good cautery that it is useful to him who endures it, and he finds it when he needs it.</start_of_turn
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But the cautery with the physicians is best when it is used on two fingers which have a perforated palm, in which the tendon of the wrist has descended from the air, or from iron, the length of the edge being two thumb-nodes, or as much as these.</start_of_turn
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.

Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then lay the wound above the heel of the bed, the sick man being over the wide side of the bed.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly above the heel of the bed much.</start_of_turn>
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of warm water, which is heated with a moderate fire, and keep it for an hour: and the sick man will endure the biting of his wound, and its swelling, for he himself finds the biting of the wound like fire, until the biting subsides.</start_of_turn>
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the wound with sweet water: then leave it for three days.</start_of_turn

Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unslaked lime, both of which take up half each: put both into a new vessel, the lower part of which is pierced with a small hole, according to the quantity of the radius which is to be treated: and put under the bottom of the vessel another vessel filled with water: and pour over the alkali and lime from sweet water, which submerges both by a finger: and when you have compressed them with your hand with a good compression: and pour out the vessel, until the acute water has descended from the treated part.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then add all the water, and throw the sponge over the other heel: and withdraw the heel until it returns.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	The water itself is often strong and acute, which is administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of the remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	For it performs the work of fire itself
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And there are many physicians who, when they cauterize widely, use tallow, beeswax, and soap, so that both are mixed together
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	Galen himself, speaking of an ancient practitioner, relates that he cured the pain of an aching heel and sciatica: and praised his method highly
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	He said that no other cure was necessary, and that he himself had suffered from a swelling of the foot for a long time, until he was healed by this method
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	It is like taking the thigh of a young man: and if you cannot find a young man, take dry [horse dung]: put much of it with some fat, and put it on the heel where the pain is, or on the knee or in the hip: and bind it, and let it go for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels comfortable.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put the sponge into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When the sponge is soft, put it into the shoe
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain goes away and is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that no other cauterization should be used along with these medicines, except after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who says this, when he cauterizes the heel with horse dung, gives relief from sciatica: and does the cauterization in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let a lancet be held, and let an old olive oil be taken, and let it be poured over the deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot and between the nails, and is closer to the nail.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and burn it, until it turns to charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it over the lancet and let it go, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Repeat this procedure.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease doing this until sensation returns above the application of the lancet, and the pain has ceased
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called cauterization of the Vaccinum

Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When there is pain in the back from many wounds, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, or in like manner, from the infusion of cold and moist matter: in this case cauterization is not useless, except for one kind which is made from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore after evacuation of the sick person with foul pills and like things, to make three lines on the back, where there is pain, according to the width of the almond of the eye: and let five cauteries be made on each line, or more according to the patient’s tolerance of the pain of the disease: and let the cauterization be made with the cautery needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	Or if you wish, cauterize three or four times with the middle cautery needle, according to this form

A sign of its inception is that it happens over stricture in coughing, at elevation, and motion: and is found in the lower spine and its nodes, which begin to rise above the rest of the vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you have thus helped it, and wish to make it cease, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular according to this shape
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	Capture the cautery over the whole of the vertebrae equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebrae with a point cautery, make two or three points close together
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place, until it is healed as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	Be careful, do not apply the cautery to a swelling, which is in a nerve spasm.

When joint pains are caused by cold humors which flow throughout the body, and when they happen in the feet, it is customary among doctors to call it Podagra
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When it has been cured with cold causes of Podagra, as with other medicines, and the pain does not go away, then the cautery will remove it
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is necessary to cauterize around the joint after emptying it with multiple cauteries: and let the cautery be of Olive oil.

Then put your hand on the place, so that the intestine does not go out: and you have opened between the ribs, and put under it some powder, and another one on the ribs that holds his hand.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then put the cautery on the sign itself, your hand with the cautery standing straight up
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it there, until you follow the bone: or do it again with oil if you have not followed it with oil from the beginning until the bone
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And observe prudently the exit of the intestine at the time of your cautery, that you do not burn it, and that it comes out through that over the patient or the wound, or a great malice

When, however, ruptures happen in the rest of the belly, and are beginning to form, and it is desired that they should not grow larger, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to their size: and let it be so that from that time on it appears as if a third of it has been burned away
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	And then care for it as we have said: and do not add to it.

Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When something happens in some limb by wound or blow, and pain persists for a long time, and does not yield to treatment with physicians: then it is necessary to cauterize with the Puncti cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be performed on every limb according to its size, its shape, its toughness, its strength, its position and the pain from it
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the cautery over it again.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For the custom of these pains is that they change from one limb to another approaching that which is most painful
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore follow them with the cautery until the infirmity is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	And concerning the cautery of Lepra...
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Leprosy, however, is sometimes treated by cautery with the greatest care
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially those species of Leprosy which arise from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: with such ones great care is necessary for the cautery
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If indeed the Lepra is not severe, and you wish to treat it with this, as we have said previously, and it does not subside, neither does it remain: and when it has spread over the whole face: then cauterize it over the head five times: one in the middle of the head between the ears, and the second below it at the edge of the hair, and two over the two horns, and one behind the earlobe.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally touch your hand with the cautery lightly, until you make an imprint in the bone, and the cortices are displaced from it: so that the emission of thick vapors from it is alleviated, and cauterize the spleen also with the cautery, as we have said before
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If, however, leprosy has become sparse upon the sick person, and is apparent, then it is necessary that you should cauterize with these cauteries which we mentioned at the head, and with a cautery upon the extremity of the nose, and two cauteries upon the two maxillae, and two upon the spines of the neck, and six upon the spines of the back, and one large one upon the hairless parts at the root of the tail and one above the middle of the palm: and two upon the ankles: that is, upon every ankle one, and two upon the knees: one upon every knee, and two upon the humeri, and two upon the cubits, and two upon the armpits of the chest. And cauterize the whole of every joint, from the joints of the fingers of the hands and feet, and cauterize the whole of every heel of the feet.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And cauterize the nerves which are upon the posterior heel, that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when you cauterize with a cautery upon the bone of the pelvis, and another upon the bone of the stomach, and another upon the spleen.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And you know that the more you add cauteries, the greater the damage, and the greater the suffering.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you know that the sick person does not find ease in the cautery, as they find rest in health: because the body of the latter is already stunned
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	It is necessary that there be large and small cauteries according to the members and the joints: according to what has preceded from the kinds of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the cauteries with a mixture of barley flour and honey, and the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.

Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any limb is stiff and will not recover with medicines, oils, plasters, it is then to cauterize the stiff limb with cautery, according to the size of the limb or its degree of stiffness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery not pass through the thickness of the skin superficially.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents until it is healed
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when it is cauterized for some stiffness of the hand, foot, in the bones of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the stiffness will be moved away
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But it does not matter over that, except for one who is skilled in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves moving the body
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Thus cauterizing in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Head LII
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras has become old and does not yield to any medical treatment: then cauterize over the surface of the deep cautery sparingly, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnica, and poppy seeds, and hyssop blood: from each of these things take one part: mix all these things together and smear them over the wound, and they will adhere to the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	Thus cauterizing in Cancer
Caput LII.	Head LII
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference as it turns.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise men have said, 'The cautery should be performed with the last cautery in the middle.'
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	I do not see that this is necessary: for I fear that it will cause a burn. And I have seen this happen many times before.</start_of_turn>
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	It is better to cauterize around it in a circle, as we have said: or with multiple cauteries.</start_of_turn>
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	Regarding the cautery of Adubelati.</start_of_turn
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.</start_of_turn>
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Adubelati and it is delayed in maturation, or because of excessive fat, or because of old age which makes the patient weak, or because of the passing of time, and he wishes to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, puncturing.</start_of_turn
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then remove the dressing.</start_of_turn
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will itself hasten the maturation.</start_of_turn
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If, however, you wish to perforate it with the cautery, then make a burn with the cautery that has this shape.</start_of_turn
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be far from the healthy parts, in order to relieve the pain.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Regarding the cautery of the soft swelling.</start_of_turn
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII.</start_of_turn
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A soft swelling is not except for a corruption in a limb that is able to walk, and it corrupts it: just as fire consumes dry wood.</start_of_turn
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If there is any fluid which has eaten away its place and tolerates cautery with fire, then burn the cautery much, make the nails small and great, as it shall be fitting in the place where the corrosive matter is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Burn it from every side until you have eradicated the whole corruption, and let nothing remain of it inside or outside
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then remove it in three days, and put upon the cauterized place sulfur three times ground with oil, until all the eschars are eradicated, and all corruption is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it with nourishing unguents of flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If there is any fluid which after three days new flesh is born without corruption, this is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then burn the cautery once more over that which remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corrosive is to be treated with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	It itself arises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	But truly, the cautery with fire is faster in its action: and I indeed said above that the cautery should be made with acute medicine in its application: take therefore care of it there when it is indigested
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	In the manner of cauterizing nails and vericles.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Many things happen in the lower parts of the feet with this disease: and it is a great, filtering thing that causes damage to the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And the cautery is done in two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with warm water
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	When done with fire, let the cautery be in the shape of a concave curve like the nail of a hare: which is made of iron, according to the quantity which contains the nail from every side: and be fine at the edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then lay the burning [incense] upon the palm of the hand.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then retract the hand with the cautery around the circumference of the thumb, until the cautery reaches the depth of the thumb: and keep it there for three days, until pus begins to discharge.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then cover it with sponges soaked in salt, and keep it covered with a bandage at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	The inflammation will disappear from its roots
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place where the burn has generated tissue, until it heals
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not healed, and are multiplied on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply cautery with warm water: or take a needle from iron or ivory, or from a quill, and lay it upon the thumb, or the great toe
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small quantity of warm water into the needle: hold your hand, and retract the needle with pressure, so as to impress the mark of the needle at the root of the thumb, and to bring the warm water up to the root of the thumb: and expect the patient to endure the pain for an hour
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let it go, for the thumb is eradicated with its roots
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do so with one hand after the other, until you have passed over all that is in the body from the hand
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for the rest after they have been eradicated, with that which generates tissue from the incisions.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	In this way cauterize in Tremore.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to anyone to have a tremor from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or anything else: then it is necessary to cauterize four times with the cautery, or five over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize with the cautery, and in the chest cauterize with the cautery, and over the stomach with the cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	The tremor ceases when the olive oil cauterization is performed, and the health of the cold disease returns.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	The tremor ceases when olive oil cauterization is performed, and the health of the cold disease returns.
Caput LVII.	The tremor ceases when olive oil cauterization is performed, and the health of the cold disease returns.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When the large matter in the body of Albathir is expelled, that is, pus, which arises from corrupted matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, in the first place when it appears, it is necessary to cauterize over every head of pus with a fine cautery of myrtwood, whose extremity is kindled with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the long radix of aristolochiae
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cautery
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when the cautery has been performed around the circumference in the beginning of the expulsion, according to this method: and they do not increase; the superabundance breaks and the superfluous is expelled, and health is restored from the remnants.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary to perform this after the evacuation with a phlebotomy
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Of the cauterization of the flux of blood from the artery in the wound.
Caput LVIII.	Of the cauterization of the flux of blood from the artery in the wound
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times blood from an artery escapes from an incision made in the wound, which happens either externally, or at the base of the wound, or from the cautery of a limb, or like this: and this makes it difficult to close the wound
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to anyone, then take hold of your hand with your thumb over the orifice of the artery, and place your index finger over that: and tighten it much, until blood ceases to flow from under your finger, and does not escape from there again
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put on the fire a few small olive stones and many more in great number: and blow over them until they are kindled.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one, or a few, or many bones, according to the wound and place, where the artery is ruptured, and put the cautery on the very part: then move your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood is severed.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled with the finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, from those which are prepared in the fire
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not cease to do this until the blood is severed.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the nerve which is there, and do not add any other evil to the sick person
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	You know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to sever it: especially when the artery is great, except with four fingers together
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with the cautery, as we have said
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract and the blood is severed
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is bound with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or there are placed upon it medicines which have the property of severing blood, and they are bound with a constriction of thread.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever performs an excision with a ligature, and a tightening with a bandage, or position of the burning things, or like these, does not give him pain, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If however this happens to anyone, and there is no physician or medicine present: then begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have said, and the constriction of the hand, until the blood is overcome from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery itself
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger must not be moved, but should be left resting upon the cold water until the blood congeals, and swells, and is severed.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	Meantime, let him consider what is needed from the cautery, or from the medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	Concerning Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and things of that nature
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the first chapter about every ailment in which the use of the cautery with fire and burning medicine is useful, as well as the occasions when it is necessary, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I shall proceed to speak of the chapters from the head down to the foot
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I shall follow the same order in this chapter: in order to satisfy the seeker of knowledge concerning this matter
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin this, let me remind you, son or daughter, what was said in the first chapter concerning cautery
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	Therefore it is necessary to take great care in this operation, because in this chapter there is great likelihood of bloodletting with the opening of the vein, or incision over the bone, or opening of the exit, or healing of the wound, or extracting an arrow, or incision over the stone, and things of that nature: from which all these things are associated with tremor and fear, and fall in many.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	I warn you, do not be careless in this matter, for when people are careless in this art, as well as in the art of healing the sick, they often fall into the same errors as ordinary men
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	Whoever is irascible with his ailment is his foe: for his wrath arises from the awareness of his infirmity and the length of his suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when an ailment is accompanied by fear of death, it is significant
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	Whoever attributes his suffering to the physician and speaks to him with hope of recovery is a madman.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	It is not right that you should consent to his coming to you from the realm of illness with a method that is like this.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	Be more cautious of your wrath than of your love and your violence
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	Do not presume anything about it from him except after a definite science has proved it to be beneficial to you
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	Make use of the care of all sick people, the prognosis and the indication of that which is suitable for health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in this lies your aid in acquiring fame and glory, and in memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, son, your intellect, and do not take from you direction and inspiration: for this is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I, too, order this chapter to be distinguished by chapters, following the order of the Cauteries chapter from the groin to the feet: so that your request which you desire from this and for which you yearn may be alleviated from you
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Of the care for water which accumulates in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You know that this infirmity often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without gentleness
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	Whenever anything happens even from an occult cause which is not discerned.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	I am not aware of any such ailment among adults as I am among children; and concerning all those from whom I have learned, the sea has been their master: on account of this, therefore, I deem it expedient to omit the operation in this case.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	I have observed among children that whenever their heads were filled with water and their heads grew large every day, they could not sit down due to the size of their heads, and there was an increase in moisture until they died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And such moisture either accumulates between the skin and bones or accumulates under the bones on the surface of the wound
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	If there is moisture between the skin and bones and the swelling is slight, then it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head, the length of which should be like two knots, until the moisture is drained out
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	This is the form of the spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If there is much moisture and the swelling is great, then make two incisions according to this form.</start_of_turn>
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	If the moisture is under the bones, and its sign is that the edges of the head are open from all sides: and the moisture is driven out when you push your hand into the wound, and it does not remain hidden: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head according to this method.</start_of_turn>
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, drain out all the moisture.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then close the incisions with strips of linen and wool.</start_of_turn>
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	And then cover it with wine and oil until the fifth day.</start_of_turn
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then solve the ligament, and care for the wound with tension and moisture.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	Do not neglect to tighten the head with equal tension.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And keep the wound moist with little food, until the limb is comfortable and healed.</start_of_turn>
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	Another way of making an incision is to consider the size of the opening of the wound and the collection of fluid.</start_of_turn>
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes in the neck it is more, or in the armpit, or on the right, or on the left.</start_of_turn
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Proceed accordingly with the incision where you see the swelling and the collection of fluid: and cut that as much as you can.</start_of_turn
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, that you do not cut an artery, and that there is not excessive bleeding, and that the patient dies from that bleeding with the evacuation of moisture.</start_of_turn
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	As for the incision of the arteries that are behind the ears.</start_of_turn
Caput II.	(The text following this section is not included in the request and is therefore not translated.)</start_of_turn>
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When any swelling has occurred in the eyes or the chest, and it is old, and no cure has been of any avail: then the last cure is to cut these two arteries.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	You must therefore when you wish to cut easily, so that the patient bears the pain of his head.</start_of_turn
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then scrape the place with rough linen, so that the arteries appear.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then tighten the patient's neck with whatever linen he has.</start_of_turn
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulsates.</start_of_turn
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	The ears are located behind the auricle, and are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then signs with a burn above each: and cut each with a scalpel both above and below, with the incision reaching the bone: and do this across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce the spatula under the artery, and cut upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	Let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the bone is cut, blood flows out with the pulsation, which leaps inside frequently
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then it is necessary to measure from the ear the quantity of space of three fingers
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then signs with a burn, and find until the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what should be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps more or less is emitted from it
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this according to the quantity which appears to you from the patient's sickness and the repletion of the artery itself.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains anything of the bone from the shaving, cut it off so that no callous swelling occurs: then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	And take care of the wound with ointment, until it is healed
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in temporary cases
Caput III.	Chapter 3
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man an old headache, or acute catarrh due to acrid humilities, and heat in the lacerations of the times, or old soda, bile, or like these: and when these are treated with the methods of the medical art, and do not yield: then we are experts in these ailments of the arteries of the times, or their cauterization, as we have mentioned
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And as regards the method of operation in the extraction of ears, it is that the diseased person should pluck the hairs which are in the temporal regions, and bring them down to the apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It is itself evident from its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few individuals, or because of excessive cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden, the diseased person should tighten his head with whatever garment he has: then he should rub the place with rough cloth
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	or apply warm vapor to the place, until the artery becomes visible.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take hold of the forceps, which are before like a sickle
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	And scrape away with it the skin with ease, until you reach the artery itself
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then pull out the vessel upwards, and extract it to the upper parts, until you have extracted it from the skin, and make it retract from under the clothes from all sides
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is thin: then grasp it with the end of a needle.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And then cut from it the second part according to the length of its extremities, and contract, and do not allow the flow of blood to occur
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut through, and if it is not severed, the blood will not ascend fully
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then wash from the blood about six ounces, until about three remain
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to ligate it in two places with double silk, strong, from silk: or with silk thread, so that it does not swell before the wound is consolidated, and the flow of blood is restored
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	And then cut away the surplus, which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do it now or later.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	Perform it now or later.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	It is better to do the work now rather than later, especially if the patient has a fever or is flushed with heat.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cautery is from the earth, which helps to dry up humors.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore, it is better to burn (perform the surgery).
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that the place be closed with old silk: and put above the middle of the wound a little piece of wool.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after closing, care with dry medicines that make the flesh grow, and with lint, until it heals
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If during the work blood flows from an artery, then immediately cauterize it or put in place a plug with a sliver of bone: and bind your hand, until the blood is stopped
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If nothing of these things is present, then put over the place of the digit your hand, until the blood solidifies
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embroider the place with cold water, until the pain subsides, and bind according as seems best
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from this it is easier and more convenient to extract the artery, namely to cauterize it with this cautery that has two knives: and let the pain of the two knives be like an ointment
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	Indeed, they are much less acute than two knives
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are acute, like two knives, they cause great heat: and do not penetrate the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When anything in the body is of a greater size, and is held fast by the heat of fire, and is soon severed: in such a manner is this work better than all others, more easy, and more convenient.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	When the space between two nails is equal to the breadth of a finger, after you mark two points with an incision: and you lay both of them alight, until they reach the bone, and they touch at two points: in order to lengthen that which is between their extremities
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For in this way they do not solidify together.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	About the care of acute tears from the eyes.</start_of_turn>
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.</start_of_turn>
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are acute and flow from the eyes, which are above the outer part of the head: and there is no need for any medical treatment with a physician, and the face of the patient is reddened, and he feels a wandering in front of him, like the wandering of ants: and his eyes are swollen, wet, for they are corroded by the tears: and the eyelashes are reddened from the intensity of the tears: then the ancients considered in the treatment of these ailments this operation, and they called it Ense.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is like shaving the hair on his face.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions on the forehead, equidistant from each other according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and let one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of the lower jaw, and the third from the other side: and cauterize from the arteries that are on the two sides. And extend your hand from the continuation of your two mandibles, and let the space of the incision be equal to the breadth of three fingers joined together. And let there be a sponge prepared, or dry cloth, with which to soak up the blood.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce the sponge of two acute extremities, whose form follows.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision from the temporal side to the second incision: and scrape away the whole skin between the two incisions, with the sponge, which is over the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Do the same also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then draw out the sponge, and introduce into the first incision once more an instrument called the acute knife, from one blunt side, not from the acute side
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place the acute edge towards the meat annexed with skin, and the blunt edge towards the bone: and press it in until it reaches the middle cleft: and cut away everything that hangs down from the head to the eyes: except that which remains of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Do the same in the middle cleft until the other cleft
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when blood has run out in an equal quantity, express the place from the coagulated blood clots
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every incision a piece of old cotton, and place over it soaked wool plugs in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that no cold swelling occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day heal the ligament, and give a large infusion with warm water
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it from the ointment of basilisk, and for the rest which heals wounds: until it is healed
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	About the care of acute tears and catarrh of the eyes from the inside of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute catarrh, acres, or assiduity occur to anyone: and the tears of his eyes are prolonged, small, and the sight is impaired: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from the edge of the eye, and there is acute pain in the depth of the head, groaning, and sneezing follows: then take from these signs that the matter and the catarrh do not come from one source, except from many tears.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best cure for the eye is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is to make the patient scrape the front of his eye with his finger
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make an incision one-third in the middle of the front, or somewhat lower in breadth, and begin from the left side to the right side: and let the incision reach the bone: and stretch your hand from the bites of the teeth, which move during chewing: until the bone is detected: and you will extract all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with cotton wool or strips of linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind above with thread: and soak the thread with wine and oil, so that no abscess forms.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have finished with this, and the swelling of the abscess has gone down: then it is necessary to heat the bone, until flesh begins to form in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	And then care for the eye with the regimen of drying which makes flesh grow: like if you take from wheat flour two parts, and from colophony four parts: and prepare from these materials a plaster, and give it to the eye until the flesh grows in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	And concerning the care of the eye that falls in the autumn.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Every part that falls into gold is of four kinds: either a mineral lapis, or one like it, such as iron; or it is derived from a plant, such as cicer and beans; or it is a flowing substance, such as water and vinegar, and things that resemble it; or it is some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When any lapis or stone falls into gold, or any genus of stone that does not grow or exist in gold, it exposes the gold alone; if any liquid is poured over the stone, there will then be distilled from the fat some liquid from the fat of the stone, or from the blood
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction and make the patient sneeze with conditions, and anoint the nostrils above the sneeze, after you have put around the ear a cloth or bandage, and extend the gold upwards
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Many things depart with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If they do not depart, then administer the extraction with sponges, that is, fine sponges: which are of this form.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If they depart with the sponges, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if they do not depart, then administer the extraction with a blunt needle of small size.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If they do not depart by this, then make a hole in the ear with a needle of air, and introduce the extremity of the needle into the ear much, and anoint what is around the needle with butter mixed with oil, so that there is no air remaining except the air of the needle: then draw out with your hand with a strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Many things depart with this which we have said.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If they do not depart in this way: then take from barley or from vinegar, that is, prepared gluten, with which birds are caught, a remedy: and put it on the edge of the radius after you have wrapped round the heel placed centrally: then introduce it into the ear with ease, after you have dried the gold from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If, however, it does not go out with all that we have said, then it is proper to cut before the swelling becomes cold or spasmodic.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	The method of incision is as follows: first of all, let an untrained person draw out the blood from the head: and take from him blood in proportion to his worth.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then sit the patient between your hands, and draw up his skin towards the head, and make an incision in the middle of the ear at the place where there is a dimple: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent until you reach the bone: then take out the instrument with that
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take out the instrument with speed from the hour, and care for the wound, until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If there is a foreign body in the ear from a grain which has grown and swelled: then order its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey you in coming out, then take a small towel, fine and subtle, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the excision of that kind from the grains which fall into the ear, and do not make that, when you think that that grain is already softened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it out with great force: then take it out with hooks, or with a subtle hand, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction relieves it.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But in water which enters the ear, it is necessary that the patient should sneeze at first: and then put into the ear a little cotton wool with a little butter: and lie down on the ear which is in the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it comes out by itself, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of the finger, firm, soft, and heat them with fire near, and let the patient put one of his ears into the hole of his ear: and he should lick his foot with that hand, and strike with another stone on the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Until all the water has drained out, do not cease to work with the stone and the stone.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	Until the water has drained out, do not desist from working with the stone and the stone until the fire has consumed a portion of it, or until it has consumed one joint of the bone, and you introduce the extremity of the former into the cavity of the latter: and raise the other extremity with fire until most of it is consumed.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the process with another joint, and do this many times until all the water has drained out: and extract the latter with a needle as is prescribed in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that is within the stone, such as a flea or anything like it, take care of it as I have said in the explanation.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body, which appears to the sense: then manage the extraction of it with hands and needles: and thus it is easier for all who hold the stone.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of worms that are generated in the stone, when you have cured it as we have said in the explanation of distillation and other treatises, and your care has not been of benefit: then it is necessary to burn the stone in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If anything appears there from the worms, then extract it with hands or with fine needles.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If nothing appears there, then take a needle of this shape, straight below and wide above: and introduce the lower extremity into the stone according to the quantity which the sick stone can tolerate: then draw out with this strong suction
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the worms have drained out
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you with regard to their exit, then smear the circumference of the needle with grease, like I have said in the stone
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not go out with it as we have said: then administer distillations which the ancients are experts in concerning the bites of dogs: and you will find that in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your effusion be that which you pour out fats and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	Like wax you make it from silver or gold, lower part tight, in which there is a small hole, the upper part wide open
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let the impelling force which is in the cavity of the tube be made of air, centered
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a radius and encircle in its extremity a sponge soaked in the descent: then pour oil, or gum, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then insert the radius with the sponge above, and press it with your hand compressed, until the oil is driven into the cavity of the ear, and the patient feels it inside: and what is poured into the ear is already warmed with fire near: and beware that nothing is distilled in the ear which is cold and wet: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Of the care of the burn of the Golden Ear.
Caput VII.	(The text continues with the next section of the translation.)
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Whenever some infants emerge from the holes of their mothers' breasts unpierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And sometimes also to men happens a burning in the ear from a wound, or from the natural hardness of the flesh in that place
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this burning often happens in the depth of the ear canal, as it does not follow ordinary use: and sometimes it happens on the outside of the ear canal little by little, and follows common use.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Nothing happens in the depth of the ear which the eye does not comprehend is difficult to cure in many situations.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	In such cases as occur within the depth of the ear, which the eye does not comprehend, these are difficult to cure in many situations
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the like of this arises from the native tissue of the ear: then hold the needle with a fine point and cut through with ease until the whole tissue has been removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If it arises in the depth of the ear: then take a fine needle, soft and warm it with fire: then pass it through the tissue of the ear
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you feel a sensation of the condition which causes the sufferer to complain of the weight of the ear, try to open it with ease: and take care that you do not injure the nerve of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the ear a dressing according to the quantity of the opening which you have made in the Egyptian unguent: do this for a few days, until you are sure that the wound has consolidated
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a dressing and soak it in rose-water, and grind over it the residue of the masticated sage, and use this for the purpose.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you have finished with the ear: then you must remove the dressing and cover it with another dressing, which you will place in the cavity made with the rose-water, until the swelling has subsided: then care for it until it is healed
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If blood flows: then immerse a sponge or pack in cold water, and put it on the ear: and use the rest of the treatment which expels the said blood-flow mentioned in the treatise on distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the care of the Almond of the Eyes.
Caput VIII.	On the care of the Almond of the Eyes.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Althelis, which happen in the Palpebras of the eye, are either wet or dry when they occur
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to treat them with cataplasms: with honey or with an ointment of herbs from their roots
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then put on the place a little of beaten egg white
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lancet.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And the cauterization must be done after the incision
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Many of them indeed return when something remains of their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when cauterized with fire, they burn those roots and they do not return
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the care of the Big Almond of the Eye
Caput IX.	On the care of the Big Almond of the Eye
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many things happen in the eyelids something that fills the Crandnium in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called the Big One: and it is an aggregation of great humidity in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation is therefore done in this eye as you see, if there is a Big One proceeding from the eyelid, which appears from the eyelid and moves to all parts, and its resolution is easy
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore above the seam for the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape out the eye from all parts with ease until it is evacuated
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend the eye with honey, and cut it off
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, the incision is not prepared beforehand, except when you pierce the eyeball with a small incision, then it will harm the patient in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the incision is large: then join it with a suture: and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, it will not cause any harm from it.</start_of_turn>
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The ointment restores it and nourishes it.</start_of_turn>
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if it is great and extends downwards into the inner part of the ear towards the surface, then invert the eyeball, and suspend the great vessel with a ligature: except that you do not wish to make an incision, and press it from all around.</start_of_turn
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	And if the eyeball is elongated through the incision, it does not harm it in any way.</start_of_turn
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the large incision with salt water: and care for the place with it which is inccised, until the patient is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	(End of text)</start_of_turn>
Caput X.	(End of book)</start_of_turn>
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a kind of swelling which is generated in the upper eyelid: and it often happens to children: and it weighs down their eyes, and causes them to have difficulty seeing in the mornings, and they are not able to see the sunlight, because tears run down their face, and because of this the tears are dispersed from their eyes always, and over their face, and they sleep with their eyes always wet, and their eyes are always wet under their eyebrows. And the prominence of the Axirnath is seen in the eye, and when you press on it with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between your fingers.</start_of_turn>
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And thus is the manner of his operation, that he place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth, and prepare it in the blood, and make from it a circle according to the quantity which contains Axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it above the wound, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle thereof moisture with blood dripping, and let there be no greater tear than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you find the whole skin, until you reach the Axirnath in many positions, for the Axirnath comes out of the wound according to the shape of the white crust of the wound
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract thus the wound with the cloth which you have infiltrated between your fingers outwards: and you will wring your hand to the right and left, until it is scattered: and be careful, lest you add to the wound, so that you do not reach the eye with the blood, and heal it.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however the Axirnath does not appear at the beginning of the wound, you will add a little at the wound with ease, until the Axirnath comes out.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract the wound as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the cloth in vinegar and water, and place it over the place, and bind it with thread.</start_of_turn
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are some who put salt on it, and place it in the hollow of the wound, so that the blood that remains from that moisture is liquefied.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If, however, it happens in the place of the apostema [gallstone], you must care for it with sedative plasters until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Regarding the treatment of the eye, that is, when the eyelids are softened, from which it results that the eye is swollen as it should not be.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.</start_of_turn>
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow up on the eyelids of the eye beyond the natural curve, and are excessive: then they harm the eye, and cause diseases such as excessive tears, softening of the eyelids, and inflammation, until this becomes the cause of the destruction of the eye.</start_of_turn>
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And the treatment of the eye is based on four methods.</start_of_turn>
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with the use of a cautery with fire.</start_of_turn
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, as is mentioned in the chapter on cautery.</start_of_turn
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or by incision and stitching.</start_of_turn
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with needles, as I will say.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the patient in your lap.</start_of_turn
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then take hold of the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.</start_of_turn
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it turns, that is good.</start_of_turn
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce the needle into the flesh at the point where the hair arises from the lower part of the eyelid, and pass the needle through with the thread until it reaches the hair itself, which is near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and fix the knot.</start_of_turn
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find within the inner part of the eyelid beneath the added hairs with the edge of the spatula from the greater lacrimal gland up to the lesser lacrimal gland.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then draw out the thread and place under the small hair of the eyelid from cotton or linen: then mark upon the eyelid with cautery, which should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	It is necessary to know, that it is done according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for as it is varied in men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For indeed, there is that which demands that the incision be made from the eyelid in a large quantity, according to the quantity which is softened by the eyelid
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when the spatula is found upon two lines which you have marked, and begin from the greater lacrimal gland up to the lesser lacrimal gland, and let there be one incision near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a radius
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce the needle through one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then remove the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather together with a suture the two lips, with needle and fine thread: and stop the bleeding, and make fast what has been split from the two eyebrows with some astringents, if you wish to do so: and if not, do not worry
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then remove the suture and the thread for three days, or four: afterwards care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, remove the wound without suture, and care for it as before, which will dry up and contract.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and the gathering together of its parts: but the future is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	Ancient physicians taught this method of treatment for Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	Truth be told, excessive solicitude is harmful to the sick man; it is good practice, and not otherwise
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	There is another method in Ataxmir also: as the sign on the eyelids is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate hooks, or together, according to the form of the sign which follows; then cut away what is superfluous with fine scissors, according to the form of the sign, with the equality of the incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If, however, it is not possible to hold the hook, and it does not match: then grasp the point where the thread is and introduce it into the middle of the sign: and introduce another thread near the greater lacrimal gland, and another thread near the lesser lacrimal gland: and gather together the two threads with your fingers, with equality
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then lift your hand with equal elevation: and lift the skin above which the sign is drawn, as we have narrated
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and care for it until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, however, swelling occurs at the incision of your wound, or a tear: stop the bleeding with powder, and with similar things, from seated unguents.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids are also swollen, so that their lashes are congealed together.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	You must therefore use what we have said concerning the incision: but the sutures are artificial in both cases.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	¶ On the treatment of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is to cover the eyelid and split the tear that is inside, as I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two holes or two lower limbs: their length should be equal to the length of the eyelashes, and their width less than the width of the palm of your hand. And now you have pierced at the extremities from both sides from both parts where you hold the thread.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then join each one with fullness over that which remains from the eyelash, and string two holes from both parts with strong stitches, and cut them off every few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin will tighten and die, and will turn black, and will decay, until it falls away by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it is slow to fall away, then cut it out with scissors.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it has consolidated, lift the eyelash: do not prick the hair.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of the two holes which you make according to this figure and quantity in length and width.</start_of_turn

Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this is that you take a fine needle and introduce it under the thread from the fine silk, gently.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then join the extremities of it and knot each one with a fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.</start_of_turn
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then make a second knot in the middle of the thread, and knot the extremities of it if you wish.</start_of_turn
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then place your hand above your head, and let it rest near the cheek so that the operation is apparent: because the operation is slight, or even insignificant.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the silk thread through the root of the eyelash, and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly, until you have extracted the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw out the hair until above the knot: and introduce the needle into the knot with the hair: if there is one, or two, or three, not more.</start_of_turn>
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull out your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the knot in the eyelid with the natural hair.</start_of_turn>
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If, however, the knot is pulled out, and the hair does not come out with it: pull out the knot downwards, with the thread which you have made in it, until the knot comes out from the upper hole, and the eye is open: then indeed pull out the knot and the thread, and draw out both, and close the eye: and leave the closure for two days, or three, until the hair has adhered to its place, and has grown over the wound.</start_of_turn>
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	What if the hair is short: then either associate with it a long hair from the natural hair, and elevate with it: or leave it alone, until it has grown out again, and then elevate it.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the care of the upper eyelid which happens in the upper eyelid.</start_of_turn>
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.</start_of_turn
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.</start_of_turn
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental is therefore caused by the consolidation of the wound, or the section, or the cauterization, and things like these.</start_of_turn
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And thus is the manner of the operation in this case, that you find its consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and put in between them a cloth from linen, and bind them up, until it is healed.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	It is not fitting that you use in its curation those things which excite and constrict: for if you do, Alxatratus deteriorates more than before. Rather use in it those things which soften, such as barley-straw: and embroil with water, in which is boiled alum, poppyseed, and oil: and apply with it the cloth which has been soaked in it, and care for it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	The equipment of your curation should be such that you may prepare everything with skill, so that it does not solidify, according to the form which was in the beginning
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this, indeed, is the operation which we have mentioned, is not except a certain rectification of Alxatratus, that it does not return to its form as before
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	As for the care of Alxatratus which is done in the lower eyelid, and is stretching or contracting upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This is Alxatratus which is below, is what is truly called Alxatratus.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And it is accidental from a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and things like these.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the manner of the operation in this case is that you take a needle which has a double thread, and pass it through the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal gland to the right lacrimal gland, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with the hook, and cut with the scalpel on the wide side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If the outline of the pupil returns according to what is required, that is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, grasp the radius [of the pupil] and place it in the fissure, and join it with that [pupil]. And find two incisions on the inner side of the pupil, and let the extremities of the two incisions issue from two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle: until when they gather together they make the shape of the said pupil, and that is the Greek laudatory letter
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove the flesh by the amount which is the width of its lower edge above the pupil, from that which follows the pupil
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separated parts: suture the pupil with a thread of silk.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the ease with which we have done, of the soothing medicines, and of the salves, until they are healed
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if Albucasis should happen from the incision and the suture, or the cautery: then it is necessary that you find a flat wound under the eyelashes, even according to what has gone before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with a salve, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the sermon concerning the care of Albucasis, when it is above, or below, is that it should be carried out in that operation, according to the form of Albucasis.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For itself there are many varieties in form: and the skillful artist prepares the mind in any way that is possible for him, until he makes the figure resemble the natural form, or is close to it, and even the patient himself, according to what is convenient for him from the operation and the instruments in many situations.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	About the adhesion of the palpebrae of the eye with the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Caput XV.	About the adhesion of the eyelids of the eye with the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Whenever such a consolidation happens to many people, it is like the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, and to hinder its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	One must therefore introduce the tip of the radius under the eyelid, and lift it up: or stretch it out with a hook: then cut into the adhesion with a fine scalpel, which should not be sharp like the cutting of the scalpel, but rather obtuse so as not to irritate the patient during the operation, and to make the scalpel withdraw from the adhesion easily, and restore the eyelid to its natural form, and heal the adhesion completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour water salt into the eye, when the eye has been washed with water: or instill from a syringe containing dissolved salt with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a piece of linen thread: and put over the eye wool soaked in alum or oil: and on the third day use the syringe, and solid dressings, until it heals
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	About the incision of the nail and the prominence of the flesh of the tear-ducts
Caput XVI.	About the incision of the nail and the prominence of the flesh of the tear-ducts
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is according to two ways
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is fleshy: and is similar to hard cheese, fine-grained.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not fleshy, like frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks and does not stay fixed in it
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	Neither of these species commence until the greater lacrimal has flowed somewhat, until it covers the whole, and shuts out light and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	The method of handling the incision is as follows: you place the patient's head in your lap.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open the eyes and lift the eyelids with your hand.</start_of_turn
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with a loop of few doublings, and extend it upwards.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then grasp the needle, and introduce it through the hair of the horse, and blood, or fat: and let the thread be strong, and double the extremity of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce the nail with the needle, and ligate with the thread the nail, and extend it upwards: and remove the hair surrounding the pupil, as if you are clipping the nail until the black spot of the pupil.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder in the root of the lacrimal with fine scissors, or with small forceps: and release the natural flesh of the lacrimal, so that it does not cause excessive flow of tears from the incision.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with only a loop, or with a thread, as we have said.</start_of_turn
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is to be scraped with a soft sponge, which is of this shape.</start_of_turn
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest you touch the corneal tunic with the sponge, and cause a rupture, and perforate the pupil.</start_of_turn
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, put in the eye some powdered salt, or mix some up from barley, and keep it in until tomorrow.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for yourself until you are healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not neurovascular and does not contain marrow within, or if it does not protrude in the nail, then this kind of nail is cured with medicines and heals as I have said before.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to cut the nail, then open the eye of the patient and take a fine sponge, soft and flexible, and apply it to the tip of the nail, according to this form.</start_of_turn
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And remove the nail with the root with subtlety.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that the nail is becoming pale and cracking, and that it is leaving tracks in the flesh, then bathe your eye from an hour hence with vinegar, or with red alum, or with salt: and anoint the eye until tomorrow.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation until the whole of it is removed.</start_of_turn
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Except that in the eye there is a thick yellow pus: then hold it back, and care for the pus until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on the nail with care until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The prominence of the tear duct, if it causes great suffering in the eye, is suspended with a stitch, and is cut from it: and do not make the last incision, lest you cause the tear to become obstructed.</start_of_turn
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then bathe the tear with red alum, or make it from vinegar, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Of the incision of the nail, and the flesh that is in the eye.</start_of_turn
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	A redness sometimes occurs in the eyes of men, when the fatty substance which is in their bodies surrounding the pupil, or which is superposed, is either protruded, or approximated, or strained over the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids are turned outwards: and it is assimilated like the scales of a rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And also in this case there is an operation, that you put the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather all the flesh with hooks which are convenient for this: and hold that with a forceps or hand
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh at first, until you have finished all of it with the knife.</start_of_turn>
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And burn from the eye, so that you do not damage it during the operation: and let your incision be as we have said in the incision of the nail, or with fine forceps, with which the fat is collected, according as its shape will be afterwards.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When you have thus completed your incision, and you have moved all the surrounding fat, then remove the eye from the salt, or distill it into red powder, and similar things are done by physicians with corrosive medicines: and put over the eye a bandage of wool or lint: so as to secure it from the heat of the after-burn.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	And if anything remains of the fat, and the blood is hot, and there is a swelling: then remove the eye, and care for it until the swelling has gone down.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	And do the same again over the eye with the operation, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do the same with the addition of flesh which is in the eye of this kind.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	It is proper to know that all ailments of the eye, whether natural or accidental, must be treated with iron, without introducing the hand into any of these operations until you know that the limb can tolerate such an operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	It is proper to know that all ailments of the eye, whether natural or accidental, must be treated with iron, without introducing the hand into any of these operations until you know that the limb can tolerate such an operation.
Caput XVIII.	It is proper to know that all ailments of the eye, whether natural or accidental, must be treated with iron, without introducing the hand into any of these operations until you know that the limb can tolerate such an operation.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	The ailments of the eye are like red spots that cover the eye, and which prevent the liquid from performing its operation: and they weaken the eye with the length of the days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary therefore, in the first place, to consider whether the eye in which the ailment exists is strong and not subject to any other ailment except for the ailment: then collect the ailment of that eye
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is necessary to know, before all things, that the eye which has the ailment must be firmly placed in your hand
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be of fine steel, like the form of a nail, or let there be two hooks graduated in one body, like this form
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine forceps those veins with diligence, and withdraw the blood every hour, until you know that those veins have been removed from the eye, and have dissolved: and beware that you do not damage the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation so that you do not injure anything except for the veins
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then instill in the eye a little oil, or red pepper: so that your sight may restore what remains of the ailment.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If it is not possible to collect the whole of it in this hour, then plaster the eye with this, which will soothe the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days, until the pain has subsided: and keep it away from a cold compress: and repeat over it again according to the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of the swelling of the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.</start_of_turn>
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call the swelling of the nose a Fistula, which they cure with cautery, or with acute medicine burning, as it is appropriate to its nature.</start_of_turn>
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no wisdom in that: except that you should find pus above the swelling at its origin, and evacuate all the moisture which is in it and pus, until the bone is cleansed.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is cleansed, and the surrounding area is freed from corruption or blackness, then apply to it an instrument whose form is like this.</start_of_turn
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the Asperation of the head.</start_of_turn
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	It is made of iron thread, and its head is round like an olive, which is pierced with the point of a lime-stone, or with the point of a needle or with a fine point: and place it over the corrupted place of the bone.</start_of_turn
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then draw it out between your fingers, and keep your hand near, until you know that that corruption is gone: and do it again.</start_of_turn
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with astringent drugs.</start_of_turn
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated, and there is formed in it flesh, and the course of the ailment is over: and it remains for forty days, and does not return, and does not swell, and no accident happens in it: then you know that it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then it is not in this ingenuity, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this fashion.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is like that you should detect the second bone with iron, or with acute medicine: and when it has been detected, then take hold of the prominence according to this fashion, when there is a ferrous extremity, triangular: and the wood of it should be a protracted pyramid up to the extremity, like a river.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it over the bone itself: and let it be close to the tear duct: and extend your hand from the eye somewhat.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the prominence, until it penetrates the bone, and feel that it is infirm: by this it will be known that it has found the opening to exit from there, when you hold your hand over your nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, then restore the place with styptic medicines that are being applied, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore the flesh has been born, and the place has hardened: then the matter which was flowing outwards returns to the nose: thus it is easier for it to lie over the infirmity.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ On the reduction of the prominence of the eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its entirety, and it has not happened in any liquid document, neither by diminution: then it is necessary to dissolve the infirmity: then perform phlebotomy on it: afterwards place ointments on the surface without scarring, but with suction
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put on the eye a liniment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and olive oil, and beeswax.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye over the plaster with many small beads
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And thus with the pouls [pullets] it is: take many fine threads and double every thread above four: make many from these: then put one over the other according to the quantity required for the eye: then tighten over these with a strong thread.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	Repeat the process until the wound is closed without leaving a scar.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the sutures and keep the eye closed day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If, however, the ligament is again softened, then it is necessary to tighten it much: then remove the ligament after a day and a night, as we have said
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you again see swelling in the eye, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, the pouls, the tightening and the sutures until the eye is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Of the incision of the tunica of the eye.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the tunica of the eye, then it will protrude and proceed outside the eyelids like a grain of the tunica, and will be deformed like a man because of this. Then it is necessary to make an incision in this: and the operation in this is as follows: and it is that you introduce a needle into the root of the tunica from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle in which there is a doubled thread from the lachrymal part, and make it penetrate: and remove the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the doubled thread and ligate with it the part of the tunica around the needle: and tighten it much
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle, and put over the eye a lanolin bandage on an albumin: and leave it in place until the thread is gone with the tunica
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eyes while they are comforted, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the limb is bound up from every part with a circle of cloth, until the eye regains great elevation
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce with a fine needle that reaches the depth of the eye, and let out the humidy of the albumen, and the eye will descend, and join immediately: then bind it up until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the treatment of the eye.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This ailment which is called Alcomnati, is not except for health which collects in the eye, like descending water, and is not itself
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the way of working on it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared seat, or directly
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then grasp his head with your hands from two parts, and move him until you see the health go up to the lower parts of your eyes
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it will remain fixed, and will not descend, and the light will be extinguished: and you will know that it is water
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however the preparation of the descent of the health is not done with it which we have said, then make him sit between your hands
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine needle, and pierce with it above the corneal membrane near the continuation of the conjunctiva with the membrane of the cornea in a circle, until the health comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it comes out, then instill in the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have ground barley and honey: then care for it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Concerning the care of water which flows into the eye, or a cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Concerning the care of water which flows into the eye, or a cataract.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken of ten kinds of water which exist in the eye, and of which some are harmful and some are beneficial; take heed of this according to the state of health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then therefore it is necessary that you should keep the diseased hand away from the eye opposite the light, near the cheek: and bind the healthy eye tightly: then grasp the eyelid of the eye which has the water in it with your right hand, if the water is in the left eye: or grasp the eyelid of the right eye if the water is in the left eye
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then grasp your right hand with the almond, if the eye is left: or your left hand if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then put the tip of the almond near the edge of the visible white part of the eye: then press the almond with force: and you will see that the almond has penetrated the membrane of the eye. Feel that the almond has reached its endpoint
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the almond be to the depth, the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the black part: and that is the circumference of the eye
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see this in the pupil of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the almond until it reaches the water
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press the lower eyelid downwards one after the other.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the diseased hand will immediately close over what has opened its eye, and the almond in the eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If water descends, then lay the sponge aside, except when the vomit is evacuated.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it has become fixed and does not ascend: then extract the vomit with ease: and you turn your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water something of clear salt pearl: and wipe away with it when the eye is closed
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside the eye the whole lump of ointment, or soaked wool fat with rosewater, and alum: and bind with it the sound eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, who are of our time, put upon it a soft cushion of beaten eggs with alum.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the vomit does not yield to the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is hard like that of a stone: then it is necessary to take the sponge, which is called Alberid, whose form is like that
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	The sponge must be taken with it joined to the eye only, and do not touch the hand with the thumb: and do not do anything except to make the vomit go to the bottom of the eye
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the vomit, as we have said
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And in addition to this, prepare a comfortable bed for the patient, made in the center of the room, in which he should lie on his back in a dark room: and be guarded against all movements, and from vomiting: and give him food that will soothe his nature: and do not move his head to the right or to the left at all
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And remain quiet according to your custom until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that dark room, and experience its effect: and make him drink something.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	The procedure should not be performed immediately after surgery or during the first hour of treatment. It is better to wait a while because the fluid ascends quickly through the painful area.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If there is a cold swelling: then it is necessary to wait until the seventh day: and straighten it out along with that which settles the swelling: until it settles down: then remove the cause of the swelling and place over the face of it a bandage which will regulate the swelling for a few days, even though it exists in the dark space.</start_of_turn>

¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of the newborn flesh in the nose.</start_of_turn
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIII.</start_of_turn
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When the diverse meats of the nose are cut, something is absorbed from the numerous feet of scorpions: from this is a cancerous tumor, a stone, of saffron color; from this is what is a soft tumor, not of saffron color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	When the various meats of the nose are cut, something is absorbed from the numerous feet of scorpions: from this is a cancerous tumor, a stone, saffron-colored; from this is what is a soft tumor, not saffron-colored.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	When what remains of it from whose excision is not possible: then take that with a fine instrument with ease, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood dominates it, or thick pus arises: then oppose it by that which is necessary: either by malignant pus, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped, and remove all the meat.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then spit into the nose after the incision of the flesh, and water, or liquid.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then you know that it is healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If however moisture does not penetrate, according to what is necessary, then you know that inside there is living flesh in the upper bones of the nose, which does not disappear with the incision of the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then you must introduce a thread with some thickness, and pass it through numerous knots: and put between every knot the quantity of a digit, or less: and the patient will vomit, so that he sends out one extremity of the thread through the nose with a hook, or in whatever way is possible for him to do it: and he will pull out the stench until it reaches the stomach, and it will go out through his mouth
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	Many do like him, just as this Attomi boy often does in school. It is easy for him who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two extremities of the boy, one that projects over the nose and the other that remains in the nose
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then the minister shall bind the flesh with knots that are in the limb.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is joined with the knots of the limb.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then draw out the thread: and put in the nose after wiping away the blood with a bandage of Egyptian unguent: do this for three days, or more, until the unguent has eaten away all that remains of the flesh
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put at the end of the matter in the nose a lead cannula for a few days, until it is healed
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however urgent is the care which is required, use this.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the head-purging which is to be made, when oil and other medicines are distilled in the nose, do this with silver, or with air: which should be like fine pepper, opened like a conch shell: and its meat should be like that of the almond
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a tube.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the conch of the instrument for head-purging must be full, closed: which must have a handle at its rear, with which you will grasp it, when you heat it in oil, or when you wish to draw out something from it, and from the fluxes.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	This is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the care of the eye of the nose.
Caput XXV.	Day 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many are born in the extremity of the nose of Thelul, and they grow large, and increase with the days, until their aspect becomes like that of a wound
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, it should be cut in pieces, and its entirety should be excised.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place above it, or cauterize, or apply a burning medicine which is in its place
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If, however, its incision is delayed until it has grown large, then consider, if it be a stone, hard, of the color of feces, with little sensation: then do not touch it with the iron: for the tumor is cancerous.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Many are the times when a wound occurs from an abscess, and it proceeds from this great malice above all that which it had before
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not of the color of feces, and if the wound is possible throughout its entirety, then evacuate the sick person, and cut it without fear, without pain: and care for the place where it has been excised until it is healed
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Of the suture of the nose, and the lip, and the ear
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You know that when a solution of continuity occurs in some cartilaginous substance, it provides little support in that operation, except in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary, therefore, when anything is excised from that, that you consider whether it has any blood vessels adhering to it: and then join together the edges of the wound with a suture: then care for it until it is healed
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the continuity of the lips has already been separated, and has become one entire healthy part: then it is necessary to remove every part from its apparent skin, until the blood has clotted.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join the lips together with a suture, and bind them, and apply above it dragons' blood, and mastic of olibanum: and place above the powders a plaster of beeswax, and any other adhesive plaster: and leave it bound for two days, or three
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then solve yourself, and move the medicine: and let go of yourself, until the threads are severed by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself with the unguent, until you are healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The way of stitching is that you gather the solution of continuity, or with a loop, as we say in the stitching of the belly: or you gather the solution with the thread, as you were told
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	About the extraction of the knots of the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn>
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people have happened to have swelling in the insides of their lips like hard seeds of grass: and some of them are minor, and some are major
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to cover the lips, and find on every nodule of them, and suspend them with a hook, and cut them off from all sides
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then place the place after the incision with a bit of sponge, until the blood is separated
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it is to be bound with vinegar, and the place is to be cared for with that which has styptic power, until the wound is healed
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	About the incision of the newly-formed flesh upon the gum
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many times there is formed upon the gum new flesh which the ancients call abuluss
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore it is necessary to suspend the flesh with a hook: or to grasp the flesh with forceps, and cut it off at its root, and let the blood run, or the pus flow out
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place upon the place some coarse sponge, or other powder which has styptic power.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If the flesh returns again after treatment, for it often returns many times, then cut through it a second time and burn it: for it will not return after it has been burned.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Regarding the wisdom of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.</start_of_turn>
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When teeth gather together on the surface both from the inside and outside and between the gums, their enamel becomes rough, dark, and sometimes even falls out, and ulcers form, and they become yellow, until the corruption reaches the gum and causes the teeth to loosen.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is therefore necessary to make the infirm man sit between your hands and place his head in your lap, and grasp the molar and the tooth, where you see the enamel, and do like sand: until something remains from that, and do likewise with blackness, and yellowness, and ulcers, and other things until they are moved.</start_of_turn
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore something is taken away from the beginning of the wisdom, it is good: and if not, then repeat the wisdom again on another day, the second day, and the third day, until finally the study is complete in that which you desire.</start_of_turn>
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	You know that teeth need various rasps of different forms, many figures: according to the preparation of your operation: because the rasp which removes the tooth from the lower part is different from the rasp which removes the teeth between the teeth, according to other figures.</start_of_turn>
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these figures of rasps are prepared for you, which you will use.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn
Caput XXX.	When the tooth is inflamed and painful, and the pain is great, and the swelling is such that it cannot be borne, and the tooth cannot be moved, then it is necessary to extract the tooth.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that the tooth be freed from its pain with all possible skill, and afterwards its eradication be aimed at.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	It is not in its power to remove the pain without eradicating it: for it is a lofty substance. Therefore, when eradication is not indicated, it is necessary to consider that the sickly person must eradicate it, in order to strengthen himself, and to confirm to you that the tooth is painful
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many men indeed deceive the sickly person with their pain, and say that it is in the tooth itself and eradicate it: but the pain does not depart until the diseased tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We do not indeed go about this from the performance of blood-lettings.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When it is confirmed to you that the tooth itself is painful, then it is necessary to make incisions around the tooth with sponges, in which there is some advantage, until the gums are separated from all parts: then move the tooth with your fingers, or with fine forceps from the outset gradually, until you break it
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the forceps in a large place well, and hold the patient's head between your knees: which you have done well, for it will not move: then draw out the tooth in accordance with the rule, so that you do not break it
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then grasp any of those instruments, and introduce it under it from all parts with ease, and endeavor to move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary to fill the hole with gauze: and tie it with the extremity of a fine thread, so that it does not break in the time of your constriction with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you take care when you make incisions around the gums from all parts much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	Be steadfast in your fortitude, lest you break your own spirit, and a part of it remain broken, and return upon the infirm from that malice which is greater than his initial pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	Be cautious lest you do that which the unskilled do, phlebotomists in their frenzy, and overween their own eradication, besides that which we have mentioned
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many do indeed make their patients endure great illnesses, from which it is difficult to recover, and leave behind roots of their entire being, or extract some of them with teeth of the jaw: as we have often seen
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it is joined after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	When blood flows out from any place (for many do indeed flow out from their limb), then there is something from the limb which remains: and put in with it the cautery. If not, cauterize it if it does not give you the limb back.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The tweezers which are used to grasp the teeth in the first place are long-handled, short-handed, thick, so that they do not bend when pressure is put upon them: they are like large nails, until when they are bound to the tooth, they do not bite into themselves, neither do they bend: short-handled, and made of iron or of hammered steel, direct-handed, and in their handles are teeth, some of which enter into some of the others, and bind them together loosely, firmly
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the handles become like the beak of a bird which is called a ciconia, and are strong in their constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 1.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When the tooth remains at the eradication of a fractured piece, then it is necessary to place butter on the place of the tooth for one or two days until the place is softened: then introduce into the cavity itself the ligature or forceps, the extremities of which absorb the hair which is called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of these forceps is as follows.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities are made like a file or like a pair of pincers
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, these do not suffice to bring about the evacuation [of the fractured fragment], then it is necessary to place a hook over the root and remove the whole flesh, and introduce the small hook, which is called Palanca, whose form is as follows
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Its handle is short, its head large: and it is not to be wet, lest it break
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If the root comes out through this, that is good: and if not, it is necessary to burn with these instruments which have a similar form
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The first has a triangular-shaped extremity, in which there is some thickness
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The second has a slender triangular extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also used with this instrument which has two branches, whose form is as follows.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and materials which are suitable for teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It is also necessary to burn with this instrument which absorbs a large hair, of this form, triangular-shaped extremity which has some thickness, so that it does not break: and it must not be wet.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	You know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly the rest of the instruments do not agree. And a skilled craftsman, skilled in his art, will himself find the most appropriate instrument for each operation and for the nature of the disease.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since they are from diverse sorts of instruments, these things are not mentioned by the ancients.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If the jawbone or any other bone of the mouth is fractured, or if it becomes corrupted: then it is necessary to explore above that [affected area] in its place with the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and to handle it with care, since its shape is like this.</start_of_turn>
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be something of size in it which is gradually tightened, or held with the bone, so that it does not slip away and become loose until the bone is extruded: and restore the place with the physicians who are competent in that.</start_of_turn>
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is only a small amount of decay in the bone, then remove it from its decay and care for it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	About the closing of a prominent tooth over the others.</start_of_turn
Caput XXXII.	End of book II.</start_of_turn>
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth deviate from their natural course, a wound is formed by that shape: and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is, in those who are in their menstrual period.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary to consider this.</start_of_turn
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth has grown after another tooth and is not placed, or if it is possible to close it, or to file it down: then extract it: and if it is connected to another tooth, then cut it off with this instrument which has this shape.</start_of_turn
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small face, made of iron, with acute extremities that are blunt.</start_of_turn
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And make your incision such that you do not injure the other teeth on many days, because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not break.</start_of_turn
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, the exposed part of the limb is prominent: then apply the limb itself to the limb from inside, whose shape is like this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	If, however, the exposed part of the limb is prominent: then apply the limb itself to the limb from inside, whose shape is like that of a needle. With this, the tooth is gradually softened in many days with ease, so that it does not become inflamed, and falls out: then soften it again, and finally bind it up with some dressings.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If the tooth is loose from which a part has fractured, and bites the tongue: then it is necessary to bind the limb even more tightly until the sharpness of that fracture has gone, and it is equal: and it is flattened, and does not bite the tongue, nor corrupt the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the return of the tooth with threads.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When it happens to the front teeth that concussion and displacement has occurred from a blow, or in the case: and the patient cannot hold the bite with his hand because of pain: and it is not useful to apply treatment for it: then it is necessary to know in the tooth itself that it must be bound with thread: for silver is easily tarnished, and putrefies after many days: but gold never changes
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the middle thread be of moderate thickness and strength according to the quantity that it can grasp between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the return is that you grasp the thread and pass the loop through between two sound teeth: then you tie with two ends of the thread between the teeth that are loose, whether one or more, until you have reached with the thread until the sound tooth of the other part
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	And repeat the tying until you reach the part from which you began: and bind your hand with moderate skill and knowledge, so that it does not move forward: and let your constriction be such as to bind the thread at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not swell
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then insert the superabundant extremities with scissors: and gather each one together, and close them with the thumb: and hide them between the sound tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not damage the tongue: then release it very tightly as it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If, however, it is dissolved or fractured, string it with another thread, and keep it firm as for the whole time
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	This is the form of a tooth, and the figure of the alternation of two sound teeth and two moved teeth, as with water.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it is necessary, as a tooth returns or two after falling out in their places, and returns as we have said, and remains: and it does not happen except by a skillful, prudent, and experienced artist.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when something is adapted from bones or teeth: and it is made like a tooth in shape, and is placed in the place from which the tooth is extracted and bound, as we have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the incision of the ligament that happens under the tongue, and which prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When this ligament under the tongue happens naturally, as when a man is born, or accidentally by an injury that has healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in this case is to open the jaw of the patient in your hand, and lift up his tongue: then cut through that nerve of the ligament across its width, until the tongue is freed from its retention
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	Which, if there is something of hardness and nodulation, and if it comes from the consolidation of an injury: then cut into that tissue, and find the nerve of the ligament across its width, until you cut through the ligament and the nodule is freed
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And thus, let there be no fracture in the depth of the flesh, and cut the artery there, and blood flow will be increased.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then it shall be bound in the groove of the incision with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a piece of linen that will keep the patient warm throughout the night: so that it will not harden in the morning.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If blood flow is increased, then put over the place a bandage that is soaked in urine.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If blood boils, then cauterize the place with a sponge cautery that is appropriate for this: then care for the patient with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	As for the extraction of a ranula that is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When it happens under the tongue a small swelling that is a ranula, preventing the tongue from its natural action: and perhaps it will grow so much that it fills the mouth
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	The operation in this is that you open the mouth of the patient in front of the ear: and you consider the swelling.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see the swelling red or black, hard, which does not respond to the patient, do not touch it, because it is cancer
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then project into it a needle, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from all around
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If indeed blood boils in your hour of operation, then put over it a bandage soaked in urine, until the blood is stopped: then return to your operation until you have extracted it with its complement
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is bound with vinegar and salt: and care for the rest of the treatment suitable for this, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	For the treatment of an abscess of two amygdalar.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 6.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When these things happen between the guttur godad, that is, the glands which are like peas, which happen outside: and which are called two amygdalas: when you cure them with what we said in the previous discourse, and they do not heal, then consider them
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If there is a hard abscess, of a brown colour, with little sensation: do not touch it with iron
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red in colour, and its root is large: do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather let it go, until it matures
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then you will either perforate it: or it will rupture by itself
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in colour, round, and its root is thin: then you must cut it open
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in this is as follows: as you consider before your operation, if the abscess has become cold and quiet: then lie the patient with his head towards you: and open the abscess, and take out the pus between your hands, and pull down the tongue with an instrument of this shape
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Do it with silver, or with air, which is subtle like a knife
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you have finished with the tongue, and you see the abscess, and it has gone down on your hand: then take pliers, and hold it in the abscess, and extract the pus to the outside as much as you can, without pulling out anything from the clothes.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then strike the wound with the instrument whose form follows this.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	The instrument's tip should resemble that of scissors: its extremities are bent outwards so that the opening of each is opposite the other at an acute angle: hence care must be taken so that it does not slip or be imbued with alum.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If such an instrument is not available, then strike the wound with the spatula, whose form is similar to that of the instrument described above
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It should be acutely angled from one side, not from the other side
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have made an incision in one place, make an incision in the other place according to the same kind of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If blood flows from the wound, make the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate seeds or myrtle leaves have been boiled: or similar substances like sponges, until the bleeding stops: then care for the wound until it has healed
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when there are formed in the throat after the swelling of the two tonsils
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Strike these accordingly as I have said in the incision of the two tonsils evenly
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	I too have seen a woman who was suffering from a swelling in her throat, which caused her to gasp for breath, little sense, and caused her to close her throat: and the woman died from this, either in one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	The swelling only ascended as far as to emit two branches, until it went out through the two nasal passages
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I did this quickly and bound them together in one loop
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I drew it out, and from it there is a great part.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I drew it out, and from it there is a great part.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I drew it out, and from it there is a great part from the other side of the nose
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue: and afterwards I fixed a hook into it at that place: then I drew out a part of it, and there did not run out from it little blood: it is quite complete, for the woman's gut has become accustomed to it, and it immediately drinks water, and then takes food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	It does not cease to cut from that place many times a long time: and the apostema follows the place where I cut, until it is prolonged too much and with it
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I devised, and cauterized the apostema between the gut
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood from the addition: then I went from the part, and I do not know what God did with it after me
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Of the incision of the small apostema.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 7
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrus descends to the lower part, and there is an apostema, and it is long: then it is called perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part large and round, then it is called a loop
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with that which we said in the explanation, and the cure does not suffice: and you see that the apostema is cold and quiet from it: then it is necessary to cut it off
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is aggregated round about it, and is not of its length, and is bloody, or of the colour of rust, or black, and has no feeling: then it is necessary to make an incision of it
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	In every ailment there is fear over the infirm.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Whenever you deal with an ailment, fear is proper when you do as I have said in white, and in length, so that you make the infirm sit before the sun: and touch his tongue with an instrument whose precedent I have mentioned: then fix the knot in one, and draw it downwards: and cut through it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of two amygdales.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	It is proper that you do not cut through from that which adds to the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut through from that which adds to the natural limit, you will make the wound and the speech worse
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision make use of that which we have narrated in the incision of two amygdales: and care for him, until he is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the infirm person returns from the incision: then it is proper that you use your ingenuity in the cauterization of his without fear and aversion.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the mode of cauterization in this is not except with acute water: and it is that you place the head of the infirm person in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then touch his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with burnt lime, and put it on him not thick, neither thin, and make an incision from this with the help of this instrument
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	So that the extremities of it where the medicine is placed are of the shape of the cochlea of a radius
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the thing itself: and the infirm person lies on his side, so that the moisture from his mouth comes out from the medicine from within, so that it does not go down into his gut and harm him
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then take your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first part put it above the wound quantity of half an hour, until you see the wound has diminished, and then cease the biting of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take hold of the limb, and cover it with the medicine itself over the end of the radius, and fill the limb with the medicine, and introduce the radius with the thumb into the cannula above, until the limb adheres to the wound over half an hour
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do it many times, until you follow that you wish for the cautery of the vein
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let go of the medicine: itself will dry and fall off in three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	And if you think it is necessary to go over the medicine, go over it: and after cauterization remove the surrounding area of the vein with the thumb, and moisten with butter, and bandage with the same as was in the surrounding of the medicine: and cool it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And take care of the outside with sutures, and of the inside with gargling, until it is healed
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Thus is this kind of treatment safer than an incision and longer lasting in fear
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when the wound is healed even with this medicine that is subtler than cautery and incision: it is healed by fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamine, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and asa, and chamomile, and marjoram, and similar things from herbs: and gather them all together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil: and the pot should be covered with a lid: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, above which is made a concave instrument according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let air or silver issue forth: and let the extremity be introduced into that which contains the pomegranate, until the vapor rises up to the upper opening of the tube, until the upper part becomes dark much.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over the much, until it softens.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of an attack of fever.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Praise be to you: for in fever there is to be added in the bowels: and it does not be necessary to do this except when the fever has subsided
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if this instrument is not present to you, then take the tube and compound in its extremity bark or resin: that it does not burn the bone of the sick: for the bark of the resin hinders the vapor from burning the bone: and this is from a good treatment with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	About the extraction of thorns and bones from the gullet.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many things adhere to the gut: fish bones, or thorns, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore that you extract what is seen to have fallen down from the gut, after you have moved the tongue with the instrument at the epiglottis, and declared that it is in the gut
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And that which is not seen by you and is hidden in the gut, it is necessary that you make the sick vomit before food is digested in the stomach
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps therefore also the thing that is annexed will go out with the vomit.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the sick person may swallow a piece of poppy seed, or the root of lettuce, or swallow a dry piece of bread: or take a dry piece of sponge of the sea and bind it up, and then swallow it down
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When it has reached the place where the bones or spines are, or are extracted, it then departs.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not depart with that which we have said: then use an instrument of lead in this fashion.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a small radius, and have a curvature at its end, which intrudes into its gut without difficulty: and let its head be elevated above itself.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	Beware of its touch upon the epiglottis, so that it does not cause it to swell, and drive out with it the bone, or the spine, or be carried in by the physician’s hand itself
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	However that the patient intrudes it, that is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the thing annexed: and he drives downwards, or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, the whole thing according to the quantity which is prepared for it, until it departs
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Of the extraction of the blood-sucker
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the physician has treated the blood-sucker with that which I have mentioned in the treatise on care with the physicians, and it does not yield, then consider in the belly of the patient at the sole or behind the tongue after you have drawn out its tongue with the instrument which I mentioned to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your instrument should fall upon the blood-sucker, draw it out with a small hook, or with a handle held loosely in the middle
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If that is not possible with the hook: then take a curved needle, and introduce it into the belly of the patient up to near the gut: then introduce into the curve of the needle a burning iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this often: and let the patient abstain from all water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he shall take a full treatment of cold water and open its mouth in it: and he shall join his jaw with it and he shall not swallow anything from it: and he shall drink water an hour after the other with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	The blood-sucker will be almost finished when he feels the water falling.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if he does not depart with it as we have said, then he must fumigate the patient with sponges, or with an instrument as I have mentioned in fumigation of the fistula.</start_of_turn>
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this often, for it goes away by itself.</start_of_turn>
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the manner of operation in fumigation is that you take a vessel in which there are grapes of vitriol with fire: and the vessel is covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and you make an incision in that hole with the instrument.</start_of_turn
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then he throws away the fumigation and places the patient's jaw at the end of the tube, and closes his jaw, so that it does not escape the fumigation, until you know that the fumigation has passed to the blood-sucker.</start_of_turn
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the blood-sucker immediately goes away.</start_of_turn>
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	And if it does not go away, then repeat the fumigation often.</start_of_turn>
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the patient can tolerate to remain sitting, and eat garlic and onions, and does not drink water.</start_of_turn
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that he depart with this regimen.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the blood-sucker is extracted from the gut when it falls upon the said vomit.</start_of_turn
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like tweezers, thus: except that it has this curvature which enters the gut.</start_of_turn
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is like the wing of an owl named ciconia, in which there is coarseness of the lime: when it grasps something, it does not relinquish it entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	And concerning the opening of abscesses, their section, and their care in general
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of various modes, according as the nature of the reminder of them is remembered: and they are diverse in their perforation and section into two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of them is the species of abscess which is from the moisture of the body itself.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	The other is that which happens from the body itself
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For indeed an abscess which happens in the head is different from an abscess which happens in the belly: and an abscess which happens in a fleshy part is different from an abscess which happens in a joint: and each one of them has its own judgment concerning the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And concerning abscesses there are some which do not require perforation except after the completion of health in them, and the completion of their nourishment: and there are some which require perforation while they are raw and have not matured according to their nourishment.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	For example, abscesses which are close to joints
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an abscess when it happens near a joint and prolongs itself, until it putrefies, which is around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: which is the cause of the closer contraction of that limb
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or an abscess near a principal limb: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will cause pain or swelling or both in that principal limb
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	If it be close to a hair, perforate it therefore immediately: and it is not necessary, when perforating, to leave a crude stool, not fully digested, except when it is close to a hair, that it not putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the rectum, and make a fistula, or remain in its termination which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary to know the time of perforation of the stool, which is mature according to its completion: and it is with respect to the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and decrease of redness, and pulse, and the sharpness of the head of the stool: and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	It is necessary to make the perforation in a lower place of the stool, and immediately above the prominence: and let the perforation be wide in length of the body, if the stool is in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of laceration, and strings, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all the places equally, where there is no reflection
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	And in those which reflect, act with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When the stool is in places of hardness: then it is better to omit the perforation of it, until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to its completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you perforate it before that, you prolong the course of the disease from that, and there is much pain and swelling, and perhaps they will swell its lips, and depth of it
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some stools are perforated according to the width of the body in necessity: or according to that which the member requires
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary to administer in small stools a moderate perforation, and in large stools a wide perforation: or many sections similar to the magnitude of the stool.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are from the apostemata, in which it is necessary that the skin should be concaved: and it occurs when it has been made like a cloth, and has been made at the end, because it is dead: as it happens with many things, as with a dubelet and with boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are those which are cut through with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there are those which occur like the figure of a myrtle leaf
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like a groin apostema
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are those in which a round section and a lunar section are administered: and similar things are from sections
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which has no head, like the superficial lenious apostemata, must be perforated through a superficial perforation or flattened only.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the apostema is great and has collected much matter, to perforate it, so that it does not burst and draw out all the pus at once: rather extract from it a part of it immediately
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then anoint the apostema until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the degree [of severity]: especially if the patient is weak of spirit, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man: for the spirit of the animal is dissolved from the animal with the evacuation of the matter: and perhaps the patient will die, and you will not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore take heed of this chapter, for it contains great caution
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have perforated the apostema, which you have perforated, it is necessary to remove the wool: and consider carefully
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If there is a small wound from a fracture, either perform a plane section or administer lead from an old vessel.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	If the fracture is large and there are many holes in the perforation, it is necessary to administer medication into every wound until it reaches the innermost area
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	If you have excised a piece of skin from the fracture, or if you have bound the circumference too tightly: then you must apply an old vessel or as much lint as before, or cover it with wool without moisture: and keep it tight until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it and care for it as is necessary until it heals
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If there is bleeding during your operation in this hour, then administer cold water and vinegar, after they have been absorbed into a cloth: and put it over the place of bleeding profusely
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If the bleeding persists, then you must administer a regimen and treatment, and powders, which I have mentioned in many places in this book, and from experience.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is winter and the place of the fracture is full of nerves: then you must infuse lead with wine, and warm fat: and put it over the place.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is summer and the place is fleshy: then you must put soaked sponges in water, or fat, or both with wine and fat, and keep it cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until then, as we have said, on the third day you must drain the fracture, remove it, and administer treatment that is suitable for it until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of fractures in general
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the method of distinguishing the signs, as I have already mentioned concerning every apostemate, how it is possible to cure it is explained in a singular chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Regarding the excision of apostemata that occur in the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small apostemata appear on the scalp and are of the kind known as knots, which contain tunica, which is like a sack: they are like little roosters' houses
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	There are many kinds of these.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some are hard: others contain moisture like mud: others moisture like wet clay and stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	In the excision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as one does not damage the arteries during the process.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	The operation in the excision of these is as one must learn with the instrument which has a form like that which comes after these, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, dry it out by cutting through it superficially: in this way.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	Begin from line b to line g. When the moisture has been evacuated, remove the knot which contains it, do not leave any residue behind
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	There is much risk if any residue is left behind
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the area in Egyptian unguent if it is present: or in water and salt: and apply with the willow and let it go until tomorrow
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	This dries up what remains of the knot
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat above the said hip with the second and third finger, and if you find it not yielding, until you are confident that nothing remains of the boil, then indeed care for the wound with an unguent until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If there is a nodulus of fat remaining in the abscess: then dry that up again in this fashion, with a section having the shape of a cross: and project the nails between the two lobes of the section, and scour it from every part: and try your skill in extracting the sac which contains it.</start_of_turn>
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, it makes resistance against you, an artery is probably involved, then do as I shall tell you afterwards.</start_of_turn>
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	Do the same with a stone abscess, by section and care in the same way as before.</start_of_turn
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section of a stone abscess is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are hours of abscesses which are in the head of some men, in which there is no moisture at all.</start_of_turn
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is: because I have seen above an abscess in the head of a maidservant, and I found the abscess like a solid stone, hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if it was pierced with anything, it would burst.</start_of_turn
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses of the head which occur, besides these, such as abscesses which occur in the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the section of them is all superficial.</start_of_turn
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make the perforation always from below upwards, so as to direct the course of the healing towards below.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for that which is fitting for them from the care.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Then care for that which is fitting for them from the care of the throat section
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Many of these wounds happen in the throat, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over these which happen in the throat, there are one or many: and they are generated from each one: and every Strophe is within its own tunic, as in the nodes and the head wounds which we have mentioned
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	There are many kinds of these Strophes
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from these there are soft: and there are those which contain humours: and there are malignant ones, which do not obey care
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In this way, as the good humours are disposed in the touch, whose mark is the proximity of the colour of the skin, and which moves to all parts, and is not connected with the nerves of the throat, neither with the gullet, neither with the arteries, neither is it deep: it should be cut off with a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body from the line, b. to the line, g. and be stripped from all sides: and extend two lips of the skin with a single layer, or with several layers if necessary, as we said in the head wounds, and pull out the contents little by little.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is with caution that one does not touch the bone, or the nerve
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the blade be neither too acute nor too blunt: so as not to add your hand to the incision, or to frighten the patient, and cut only what is necessary
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If, however, you cut a vein, or an artery, or are hindered by the operation, then put in the wound a piece of charred wood, or some powders which absorb blood, and tighten the wound, and leave it until the pain of the wound has ceased, and the wound has become soft: or else you will begin to putrefy it
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	Blood is severed by the clamp Redi therefore to the operation, until completion.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your finger, if anything remains from the other trocars: therefore cut easily, and wash away.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If it is in the root of the trocar a large one: then it is necessary that you do not cut that trocar from its root: rather it is necessary that you bind it with a strong doubled thread, and let it go until it falls off by itself without any pressure
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then apply a sponge soaked in Egyptian unguent under the area that you have submerged in the blood
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the trocar is cut entirely, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and hold these themselves immediately, after you have washed because there remains no excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If however you find that there remains excess blood because of the size of the trocar, then it is necessary that you extend to the cutting of its root and extract it: and administer the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what is contained from the trocar must be perforated with a superficial perforation: so that its maturity may appear: and place the perforation from that which follows below the body, as we have said
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation, sponges with unguents, and similar things, so that it may consume that which remains from the corruption, until when you wash the wound will be found to be healed: then care for yourself with the unguents of generation of flesh until it is healed
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Regarding the excision of the epiglottis from the epiglottic cartilage accidentally in the gut.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	They say that the ancients performed this excision of the epiglottis, and no one in our land has ever done it: and this is the record of their sermon
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	When the throat is swollen with swelling of the epiglottis, it is necessary to make an incision of the epiglottis: for if this does not take place, all the veins and lungs will be weakened.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	When there is a hard swelling in the throat, in the gullet, or in the tonsils, when there is no inflammation of the channel, it is necessary to perform an incision of the epiglottis to escape from the destruction which results from the obstruction.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary therefore, when we wish to perform this operation, to cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision in the middle of the two circles, so that the section is in the fat, not in the cartilage: and this is the most suitable place for the incision, because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels from it are long.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with one finger.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then find the skin, until it reaches the channel: there will be bleeding from it at that point
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then cut the fat which we have mentioned: and it is signified over the incision of the channel by the phlegm which comes out of it, when it is ruptured, and by the cutting of the vessel.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the wound be open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the time has passed in which the obstruction has disappeared, gather together the two lips of the wound in the skin, and close it only with skin without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then give medicines which cause the flesh to heal, until it is healed
Inquit Albucasis.	Thus spoke Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this sermon which we have narrated is not an exposition, except when someone has seen that some of the aftereffects of the disease have already become softened in the gut of the patient: and the patient has died, and he desires to cut across his desire. They go to dissect Epiglottis so that the patient can breathe in the place of the wound which is causing his respiration to be difficult, and they rejoice at his death. Because of this they have commanded the opening of the wound until the malice of the disease has passed away. And it is the malice of this disease for three days, and like itself. Then they have commanded the closing of the wound and its treatment until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I have seen myself is that a handmaid took a knife and put it into his gut, and it went into the part of the lung canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	I was called to his care, and I found him spitting blood, like a dead man.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I saw that there was a wound there, and blood had escaped from the small wound
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was amazed, because neither the wound had burst open, nor did the intestines guide her: and the wind was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I did this, and I closed the wound, and I treated him, until he was healed: and the handmaid did not suffer anything, except that she coughed in the water. And she returned after a few days to a better state of health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Henceforth it is clear that there is no fear in the section of Epiglottis
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	About the section of the hernia of the gut.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This aftereffect is called a hernia of the gut, is a great aftereffect, according to the colour of the body: and it is very common in women
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	There are two possibilities: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly not natural is the origin of it
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	Accidental is indeed according to two modes: one of which is like a knot of fat.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	The other mode is like the outgrowth of an artery from a knotting
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in this is fear, and it is not right to assume it simply with the iron, except in the case where it is slight: you must try it and investigate it with the intestines
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If indeed you find it like a knot of fat, and it is not suspicious with any other swelling: then dry it off like knots are dried: and extract it with the thing which contains it from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: or if not, then explore all of it
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with the thing which should be cured until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Regarding the cutting of things which are greater than knots.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.</start_of_turn>
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have mentioned all of their kinds in the explanation: and it is necessary to know the difference between a knot and an extrusion in case of doubt
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, when an extrusion has become lukewarm, and fever, and pain which accompany it, until the heat of excess has passed away and the putrefaction has ceased: then indeed calm down the fever and heat
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When a knot does not have lukewarmness, neither fever, neither pain, and contains within itself a cyst which is its own sac, which is according to the colour of the body: and it is an inclusion like millet, and makes like batter, and is greater and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	There are two kinds: either fat or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	The colours of moisture are many, as I said in the discourse on moisture
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary therefore, when you are dealing with the cure of a Node, to experiment with it and inquire about it first with the instrument which is called the Intromissum, as its form will be found in the following chapter
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	The way to inquire about the posterior parts and of all Nodes is to take hold of this instrument and introduce it into the moist place which you find in the posterior part: and withdraw your fingers gradually until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then finally touch the hand according to the measure of the size of the posterior part
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum and consider what has come out through its wound
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore moisture is running out, whatever its colour: then dry it out with a superficial section, as I have said in the remaining sections concerning the posterior part
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	If it does not run out, then you know that it is fat: dry it out therefore with a section having the shape of a cross, as it has been taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from all sides with ease: and hold the fat in place if you can, until you have extracted it whole with the Node
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If however the sac is ruptured during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole: much the same happens in this case, then extract it fragment by fragment, until nothing remains of it
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if anything remains of it, little or much, the Node returns in most cases.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it swells and remains small: then make a hole beside your completion and pour in corrosive powders of sharpness: and bind up the hole, and place above it what rests upon the soft cushion, and care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If there is a large knot, then cut through its two lips, and care for it as that which has been incarnated
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however there is a swelling that is painful, or that does not swell: then cleanse it, and make an incision in the place where the swelling is greatest, and drain it out for two or three days, until the swelling has gone down, and the blood has clotted: and then return to the original condition
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	As to the instruments for the cutting and perforating of the wound.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are three forms of instruments for the introduction of instruments, and there are three sorts.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	The first is large, the second is medium, and the third is small
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let the first be of iron, the square end of which is blunt in the middle, so that it facilitates the entrance into the swelling
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of the instruments of the experienced, and no, that is, perforating: and one of them is called the beris, that is, the perforator, and there are three sorts
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	The first is large, the second is medium, and the third is small
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They join together, that they may investigate the swelling, and the exits, and the fistula, and the abscesses from that which is between the bones
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, and square, and flat, like a great needle which sews under silk, from citrine or from air, or from iron, or from silver
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better things are those which come from the citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And experience is also derived from black lead, which, when applied to these fistulas, causes them to reflect like glass with their smoothness.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	There are three things in number.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For as regards the size of the wound, it is either wide, medium, or narrow, according to the quantity of the diameter of the fistula and the degree of its constriction
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of the wounds is diverse, and there are many kinds of them
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For as regards their kind, there are simple wounds, which have but one curvature: and there are three kinds of them, like liquids, large, medium, and small
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	There are blind wounds also: and there are three kinds of them
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	There are wounds with two curvatures: and there are three kinds of them; and there are wounds with three curvatures: and there are three kinds of them; all of which are necessary in their place
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which the knots are cut and excoriated, and abscesses: and there are three kinds of them, for as regards their size, they are either large, medium, or small
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities which are cut are acute, and the others are not acute: and they are not to be placed in this way, except when there is an imposition of healing upon the excision of the knots at the fear of the incision of the vein, or nerves: and that the healing may take place through this and not through excessive bleeding during the excision of the abscess
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are magdas, and there are three kinds of them
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are formed from air, and are like radium, as with which alcohol is made: and at their widest end is a hidden Spatumilis point: and in it runs inwards and outwards as desired, like water.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The points of Spatumilis which are driven between the fingers at the perforation of the apostematum: and they are not perceived by the sick: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The exhalations of the veins when the flow of blood is broken: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are formed from air, or from lemon juice, round, about the length of a palm, like water: and they are transparent.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of veins be large and small with you: in order to break the blood quickly when necessary, and then when it is not there a doctor is not present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use these things for the breaking of blood in any place of the body, and do not use them except in places where there is carnation: such as wounds of the leg, and hip, and wounds of the arm, and breast, and belly, and groin, and similar places, from wounds of carnation, humors.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes these things become other small instruments like the edges of fists, according to their form: with which the blood is broken when it flows out from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or an artery: and sometimes these things become round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	As for the care of the breasts of men who suckle the breasts of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the breasts of some men swell with sleep (that is, when they begin to soil during sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain with post-traumatic fever.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever loathes that [disease], must secrete above the nipples a section like a crescent, from this line to that line, and then scrape off the fat altogether.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then apply an ointment of mercury from the medicine box.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join together two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the nipple turns downwards, and is softened by its size, as often happens with women: then it is necessary to find in the two upper sides two sections like the crescent, each one containing the other at the ends as far as the greater line contains the lesser, according to this shape from this line to that line, b. to that line, g. Then scrape off the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said concerning the sutures and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If however you do not wish to perform an incision of it because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding: then you must apply a poultice soaked in corrosive unguent under the wound, and let it go, until it has eaten away what remains of the fat.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	In the perforation of the apostematis, which happens under the nipple.</start_of_turn
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.</start_of_turn>
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These apostemata which happen under the nipple, are of the kind of hard Strophula, which contains vesicles, and from these are those which contain humours.</start_of_turn
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Which are from the humours which contain moistures, must be cut away with a crescent-shaped section, according to this shape from this line to that line, b. to that line, g. and when all that is in the apostemata is evacuated from the blood, then apply a poultice to the old wound, and let it go until another day.</start_of_turn
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the foot shall be raised up, and cared for with an unguent suitable for it, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the swelling be from a kind of knot of the Strophular kind, then it must be cut above the same, as we said in the section on the Strophulas which are equal.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, a boil extends in this way as to emit pus, then apply cautery to it, according to what has been said previously.</start_of_turn>
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	As for the section of a boil which happens because of an artery and a vein.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.</start_of_turn>
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is consolidated, then there is much swelling from the boil: and in the same way, a vein is also ruptured, as in the case of the boil and the swelling.</start_of_turn
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the swelling is from an artery and a vein, are: because when the swelling is from an artery, it is long and aggregated in the depth of the body: and when the swelling is from an infected wound of the fingers, you feel as if there is a constriction there.</start_of_turn
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is from a vein, is round in the open part of the body.</start_of_turn
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section of this boil is dangerous, especially when it is under the armpits, and the groin, and the neck, and in many parts of the body: and it is very dangerous.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it is necessary to take care of it with iron, and that which is from the outside also in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary to take care of it.</start_of_turn
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Concerning that which is from the outside, from the swelling of the orifice of the artery, find in the skin in the section in length.</start_of_turn
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the part with hooks, afterwards the artery: and loosen the gut from the tunic until it is detached.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert the hook under this and make the gut penetrate through to the other side, and bind the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as you were taught concerning the extraction of two arteries which are in the belly
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then bite the place which is between two ligatures with the ligature needle, until the blood which is in it has gone out, and the clot is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply an antidote which produces pus, until the ligatures fall off: afterwards care for this with suitable unguents until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	As for a clot which has happened from a vein, then it is necessary to take out the hand which is possible from the clot with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the hook under the place where you held your hand, and make the gut penetrate: and there be in it a doubled thread, until you have pulled it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind with this very clot the gut which is in this place: according to what I have told you concerning the ligature of a vein, from two parts with two extremities of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you fear that the thread is being pulled out, then insert another hook with another thread under the whole clot at the incision of the needle: first of all, and bind your thread in four places
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the clot in its middle, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut off the excess of the skin, and discharge that which is bound from it
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put upon this the powder which you submerged in wine, and fat.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply a cure which is made with salves and unguents, until it is healed
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning the swelling which occurs from the torsion of nerves.
Caput L.	Concerning the swelling which occurs from the torsion of nerves.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as swelling occurs in arteries and veins due to torsion, in the same way swelling occurs in nerves: which occurs either from percussion or from excessive tension, or in like manner: and it often happens in the armpits, or the calves, and in every place where nerves are twisted together: and it is a serious swelling.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It is similar in color to the rest of the body, and it is found in various positions without pain: and when it is grasped with force, a numbness similar to that of intoxication is felt in it
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	It is not a swelling that is collected in the depths of the body, but rather under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward or backward or downwards.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Because it is in the twisted parts, it is not necessary to suture it with iron.</start_of_turn>
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps some contraction will occur against it.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	And in that which is in the head, or in the face, find the skin with a spatula.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small swelling, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from its root.</start_of_turn
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If it is large, then suspend it with a thread and scrape it off: then remove it and join the wound with a suture: and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the section of the swelling which occurs within.</start_of_turn>
Caput LI.	Concerning the section of the swelling which occurs within.</start_of_turn
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	It often happens to many people in the depths of their bodies, and in the rest of their bodies, these things which are called Fungalia, because they are similar to fungi.</start_of_turn
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	When the root is slight and the head is large, and the lips are joined together.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	When the root is slight and the head is large, and the lips are closed together.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I saw a man who had two holes in his belly, which were larger than any other like unto mushrooms: there was no difference between them, neither in the white nor in the root, and they were closed together, and moisture ran out of him always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I saw a man who had two holes in his belly, which were larger than any others like unto mushrooms: there was no difference between them, neither in the white nor in the root, and they were closed together, and moisture ran out of him always.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Many are expelled from its section with much blood: therefore if blood incites you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the sickly and timid patient from the incision with the iron, then take a leaden wire made in the center and string it with it: which way is that which we have said, and discharge it in two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add lead to the stricture.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not cease to string the lead, whenever it prints in the wound, until it is detached, and falls away by itself without toil
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If, however, the wound is large of the root, then in its incision is something of fear and weakness: especially because of that which is within.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	But it is possible that you can cut through the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it, until the wound is healed
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And be careful lest you presume to cut through the wound which is of a dark color, little sense, bad appearance: for that is a tumor: and I will remind you of cancer after this
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Of the care of the belly wound.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The belly wound comes from many cuts.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from incisions of the flesh which are over the belly: and it exits from the opening in the side, or the intestines, according as happens in the rest of the ruptures
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from the blood which flows from the vein, or from the artery, as has been said before
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from swelling which is contained within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	Or if it is because of a burst abscess, and the opening of the wound: then is the colour of the pus like that of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and appears in diverse places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	Or if it is because of the discharge of an intestine, then is its site as we have mentioned, with greater diversity of place.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you touch it with your finger, it is hidden: then it returns, and sometimes there is a sound like that: and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, and causes great pain
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	Or if it is because of moisture, it is soft: then it does not hide when you touch it with your hand, neither does it tighten, neither does it increase in size.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	Or if it is because of blood, then it appears with these signs like a black clot at the edge of the wound
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	Or if it is because of dead tissue: then it is a thick, large, hard pus, and is formed according to the quantity of one thing.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	Or if it is because of swelling, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the treatment for it is as you consider, if the prominence of the navel is because of blood in the Artery or Vein or swelling: then it is necessary to abstain from treatment for it
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in this case there is fear and danger, just as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke of pus arising from an artery or vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	Or if the prominence of the navel is because of an intestine or a bladder: then it is necessary to expel the sick person, as long as he continues to belch, and to keep him still lying down.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with encasement throughout the circumference of the belly.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to lie between your hands over his back
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then circle around with a broad spatula in the circumference of the belly over the place where you encased it.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then stretch out the middle of the belly towards the upper parts, with a large hook
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him firmly in the circumference with a strong thread, or with a silk cord: and let the knot of the ligation be firm.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open up the middle of the belly that was stretched out above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you find the intestines caught by the ligation: then draw out the encasement, and introduce the index finger into it, and push the intestine inwards towards the belly: and if you find a hernia, then grasp it with the hook, and cut off its excess
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if the artery or a vein is contrary to this: then circle it around a great deal
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And grasp two needles, and introduce them through two strong threads: and introduce two needles in the circumference that you made around the belly in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the belly in four places over the needles: and if you wish, take out the needles and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and it will fall away by itself: or cut it off when it softens and putrefies
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with what is necessary from the unguents, until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	And if there is a swelling of the belly from flesh or from moisture: then it is necessary to concave the belly, as we said before
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	Extract blood, or moisture, as you find it in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for the place with it which strengthens it
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Care for the wound.</start_of_turn>
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.</start_of_turn>
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the discourse about the kinds of cancer, and how it is useful to care for it with a physician: and we must be cautious with it when caring for it with iron, lest we ulcerate it: and we have said that cancer is generated in the matrix, and we must be careful with its care.</start_of_turn>
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients have said that when cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, such as cancer that is in the breast, or in the hip, and the like, from the limbs that are located to remove all of it: especially when it is just beginning and small.</start_of_turn
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is old, and is great, it is not right to approach it.</start_of_turn
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I cannot cure anyone from it: neither can anyone else before me.</start_of_turn
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in it, when it is located as we have said, is to precede it, and to solve the patient with black bile several times.</start_of_turn
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then make a phlebotomy if you find it with a visible swelling.</start_of_turn
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with preparation in which he is placed with the operation.</start_of_turn
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then draw out from the cancer the nails that join it.</start_of_turn
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then cover the wound from all sides with the skin, according to the prescription, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not tear away the wound quickly, but express the place and evacuate the thick blood throughout, or as much as possible from the instruments.</start_of_turn
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, the procedure causes a large flow of blood from an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein until the bleeding ceases.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	(The next sentence is omitted as it is not relevant to the requested translation.)
Caput LIIII.	(The provided text does not include subsequent sentences.)
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We shall explain in detail the species of hydropsism, and how water accumulates: and the signs of each kind, and the treatment with physicians.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And what is cured with iron is not except the sole species of ascites: and it is not approached with iron the species of tympanitis: neither the species of hypospasm: for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you are treated for this species of hydropsism of the tympani with physicians, and the treatment does not suffice: then consider that.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the sick person is accompanied by weakness, or is with another illness besides hydropsism: such as if there is with him a cough, or a solution of the intestines, or things like these: then do not treat him with iron for fear of that
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If, however, you see the sick person full of spirit, neither is he with the sole illness besides hydropsism: neither young, nor old: then the mode of operation in this is that you elevate the sick person standing between your hands, and press his abdomen with your hand to drive out the water downwards to the lower part of the belly
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a sponge covered with thorns, according to this shape
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Sit two acute angles, long, with acute extremities like a sponge.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	Truth be told, there is something of slight shortness in it [the vein], which does not pass through with it to the operation until it reaches the intestine, and tears it.
Deinde considera.	Consider it then.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of hydrosis from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary to lengthen with the section from the navel to the amount of three fingers, downwards in a direct line above the loin
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the generation of hydrosis is because of the liver's disease: then let your section be left from the navel to three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is because of the spleen: then let the section be on the right side: and it is not necessary also that there should be a section on the side where you wish to place the sickly person, in order that there should not be excess of blood to the place of weakness.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with the instrument the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into it the section, and lift up your hand with the sponge between the skin, and wipe, as though you are scraping it: and let the quantity which is scraped be equal to the quantity of a nail, or somewhat less.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the sponge, until the sponge reaches the place of weakness: and that is the place of water
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then draw it out, and introduce it into the hole of the instrument, which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	It is like a cannula: it is made of silver, or air, or gold, flexible, soft, with a small hole in the lower part, and three holes on the sides, two from one side and one from the other: and its extremity is cut off, like the incision of a needle, as for urine: there is an armil at the upper end of it
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument reaches the water, it immediately sinks over the instrument, thus emptying half of the water in an hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	If you empty it out more than is necessary, the patient may die in an hour from the collapse of his vital spirit: or there may happen to him fainting which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Empty it out according to the quantity of virtue it has, and according to what is significant to you of the patient’s pulse and condition
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then draw out the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	For it remains immediately on account of the skin which retains the opening which is over the sieve: of which I have spoken, that you should perform it in the way I have said.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then do it again with the instrument the next day, if you find the patient tolerates it: and also draw out from the water the quantity which remains.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for a few days without fear, and take care of yourself from error: until there remains from the water only a little bit.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If however you fear the patient, and you discharge from the water a great quantity: then care for him with burying in warm sand, and with great sweating in bath and sun, and expect upon the seat: and care for him with physicians who are experienced, until he is healed: and cauterize upon the stomach, and the spleen, and the liver, after the extraction of the water: as I have said before
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	As for the care of children who are born in places where the urinary opening is not pierced.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.</start_of_turn>
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When anyone is born from his mother’s womb, and his head is not pierced, or the opening is narrow, or is not in its proper place
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary therefore to aid promptly when its perforation has occurred simultaneously with its birth when Spatumili is applied thinly upwards, according to this fashion.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place in the wound a lead weight thinly, and bind it: and keep it for three days, or four
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When it wishes to emit urine, it is to be moved, and mixed together.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not permit it to close
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He whose opening is strict is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	He in whom the opening is not in its place, is treated with lead
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	Because from the matter which is born, the opening is at the end of the bladder: wherefore it cannot mix forward until the bladder is elevated by its hand to the higher parts
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Neither is there generation, because the sperm cannot reach the womb according to the rule: and is a grievous wound upwards
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of treatment in this is that the sick man be supported on his back
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the bladder with your left hand by means of elevation, and cut the head of the bladder from the place of the penis, with a knife, or with sharp Spatumili: as if it were the cutting of a reed, or as you would a root, so that the middle of it comes out like the head of the bladder: and that the opening be in the middle according to what is necessary
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And take care that there be no bleeding during your operation
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Many things happen indeed.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Opposition to it should be made with that which binds blood, and care of the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	As for the things that happen in preparation and the head of the wound, and corruption, bruising, and adhesion.</start_of_turn>
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.</start_of_turn
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Many things happen indeed in this wound of the ulcer, and it is the elevation of corrupted meat.</start_of_turn
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And among these there are some which are malignant, and some which are not.</start_of_turn
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	The malignant one must be suspended with a fine thread, and cut off, until the whole of it is gone.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put over it a covered coat of Egyptian unguent.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with fine unguent until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the wound is malignant, having the colour of meat, then it is necessary to administer cauterium in it after its incision and at the same time.</start_of_turn
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If however the wound is in the head of the ulcer, not circumcised, and is a part of the wound both within and without: then it is necessary to strengthen the wound which is within first, until it is consolidated, and then care for the exterior. For when you care for the exterior while neglecting the interior, the ulcer will burst.</start_of_turn
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And in the testicles also, and blackening of the ulcer and corruption.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	It is necessary therefore that you drain away all that is swollen and which wants to corrupt, or which is already corrupted.</start_of_turn
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then line above the wound following that with honey which has been consumed with wheat and barley flour, and trefoil herbs of the kind which are cribellated.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then keep it under care with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If blood should flow, then apply a lunar cautery according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	A cautery is an ointment which has two properties: to stop bleeding and to heal wounds when corrupted
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the worm has been corroded and all is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary to introduce into the meat a lead cannula so that the poison may mix with the wound
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In dealing with the covering of the wound with the head of the worm, and these two things are not joined together, except in that case where the covering is sound and no excision is necessary: and when it is necessary to excise, it should be done with a blunt spatula until the ligament is severed and the head of the worm is freed from all sides
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern between these two things, then it is necessary to excise something from the head of the worm and from the covering
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	For in the case that the covering is subtle, it is perhaps pierced by its subtle nature or quickly
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the covering from the head of the worm with fine linen cloth which has been made wet in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then keep it with balsamic vinegar until it is solidified
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the treatment of children, and the care for an error in an accident.
Caput LVII.	Head Chapter LXVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not the completion of continuity, like other wounds: indeed, when it is done by our operation, by our will, and when its benefit is in children themselves, it is necessary that we sign it to indicate that we have performed a good operation, and that we have not thereby diminished the benefit.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only by experience that we have learned it
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Because I have found a greater part of the artifices, and phlebotomies, useful for purification by circumcision, with a knife, and with nails: and that they are used for the insane, and bound with thread, and incised with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have tried all these methods, and I have not found a better purification than by knife and thread
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in purification with a knife, much skin is often thrown away.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the prepuce has two tunics: so perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower tunic is threatened: it is therefore necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and to avoid future pain
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when purification is done by the insane, that is, by digitalis, as the physicians do, the incision of the extremity of the penis is not secured: for perhaps it enters through its foramen
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In purification with a nail, perhaps the iron will go through, and will corrupt your operation: and the skin of a child is short in nature, and many are born thus, which does not befit purification: and I have seen this
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	Purification with a knife and thread is a good experiment that I have undertaken: for the knives are proportional to the incision: because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you have finished with your hand, two acute angles are formed, and they meet according to the operation of one in the same time: and it makes a compression similar in figure, containing the skin of the limb from all sides, so that no error occurs at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	The proper way to perform the operation is to estimate the extent of the wound, especially if there is someone who understands the matter, because you must not do anything unless you tie the thread in the limb itself: and you let it go until tomorrow.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him laugh and be merry in every way that you can, from which he will recover his intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and do not sit: and hide the instruments in your sleeve or under your foot, so that no boy sees them, neither anything of the instruments
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into the limb and blow into the skin, and draw it up, until the head of the limb comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then loosen what is gathered in that cavity.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie the lower part with a little of the ligament alongside
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then take hold with your index finger and thumb, the place of the lower ligament with a good hold, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then pull the skin up quickly and extract the head of the limb.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better thus) and put powdered sulfur on: and put a bandage over the place where the swelling has gone down, crushed with recent good salt: and let it go over it until tomorrow: and take care of the rest of the treatment until he is healed
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the knife for cutting is thus.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Two blades extend at the extremities, and their convergence: do not extend into the substance of the nail: and let the length of the two be equal to the length of two thumbs together
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The error which occurs in cutting is: perhaps the entire intrinsic skin or a part of it escapes at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you extend your hand with your nail before the cutting of the place: and you cut according to the equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you are unable to hold the hand with your nail, then extract the hand with your thumb and cut the place.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If, however, three days have passed and what is under the nail remains swollen, remove the nail: then leave it until the swelling subsides, and when it has become soft, remove it easily and cut it as has been prepared before: and take care that you avoid the head of the nail
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not cause him any harm.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore care for it as we have said in the treatise on powders: and if it occurs from the skin above the measure and goes upwards, it does not harm him even that
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore care for it as we have said until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	¶ On the extraction of a retained nail from the nail bed.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.</start_of_turn>
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the nail bed arises from an operation made from stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or native flesh, or similar things from which we have spoken in the methods of treatment in general
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	If the bladder does not yield, and you suspect its retention is due to a stone in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that it be rendered infirm upon its knee.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then you must place the foot of the limb above the back of the limb, and extend the belly from the upper part of the back, and bind the infirm limb with the thread as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It is thought therefore that the stone in the neck of the bladder will be expelled towards the buttocks: which will cause the bladder to recover
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it does not yield even thus, and you believe there is something above the infirm limb: then you must perform an extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which is shaped like a silver awl, is subtle, flexible, and curved like the quill of a bird in the smoothness of a radius, as long as the breadth of a palm and a half: with a fine needle at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	The way to discharge the bladder is thus, that you take a doubled thread and bind in its extremity lanam or cotton, a good ligation: and insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and pierce with shears if anything comes out through the wool, but truly insert into the needle with certainty, as with a spear
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then wet the syringe with oil, or butter, and vinegar: and make the infirm person sit upon a seat, and support the bladder, and apply to the neck of the bladder oil with herbs and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the bladder with ease, until it reaches the root of the bladder.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then pull up the limb above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe into the limb, until it reaches the bladder, and the infirm person feels that it has gone to the source of the pain: and do not do this except in the case where the channel through which it goes is tortuous
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread gradually with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The thread shall follow the wool gradually.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw out the thread, and make the gut run through the opening of the bladder: and repeat the needle, and do not desist from doing this until the bladder is emptied and the wound has healed.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of the bladder-wash with Clepshydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood is frozen in it, or pus is formed in it, and the urine is distilled into water and medicines: then it is done with an instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form.</start_of_turn>
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is blunt, that is, closed.</start_of_turn
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And there are three holes in it, two from one side and one from the other side, like a needle.</start_of_turn
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which that which drives it rests, be according to the quantity that it desires without addition, until when it is drawn with something, the humilities are attracted to it: and when it is driven out, when it is expelled far off: according to what the Clepshydra does, which throws out pitch, that is, Greek fire in battle.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore urine is to be thrown out into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the Clepshydra into the urine, and draw it out with that which drives it upwards, the urine is drawn into the concavity of the Clepshydra.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its extremity into the bladder, as we said concerning the needle.</start_of_turn
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive moisture with it which drives out the other [moisture], and the moisture which remains behind adheres to the surface immediately, as a sick man feels.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form a soft enema which fills the belly.</start_of_turn>
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Make it of silver or gold: whose head is like a small bowl, and under it the sinus where the ligament rests.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the belly of a sheep, and put in it the moisture which fills the enema.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind the two sinuses together with strong thread and a doubled piece: and warm the moisture gently over fire.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the extremity of the enema into the belly, then draw your hand over the belly with the moisture tightly bound down until the sick man feels that the moisture has reached the belly.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however the belly is not present, then take a piece of sponge, and make a circle of it, and pierce it through from all its roundness.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread firmly through those holes like loops.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle like a ball of yarn: when you have put in it what you wish of moisture, oil and water.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it with an instrument: and do it like you did with the belly when expressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the belly.</start_of_turn
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On Lapide Extraction.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.</start_of_turn>
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have spoken in the treatise on the kinds of Lapis, and their treatment by physicians: and we have spoken of the difference between the Lapis which is generated in the bowels and the belly, and the sign of the whole: and we have spoken of the Lapis in which the operation is performed with the hand and section: and it is the Lapis which is generated in the belly itself: and that which appears in the gut: I will speak of this with manifest explanation and abbreviation.</start_of_turn
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say, therefore, that the stone generated in the bladder commonly occurs in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is known that the urine flows from the bladder like water in its substance: and there appears in it white sand, and it irritates the painful area, and it works with it, and is often suspended
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it rises up and flows out with it through the anus in many cases.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of children from this is easy, from which time until they are fourteen years of age
Et est difficilis in senibus.	It is difficult in old age.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In young people, however, it is middle-aged; in which there is between these two: and its intensity is such that the greater the stone, the easier the cure: and if it is small, the cure is more difficult
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the cure, it is necessary at first to loosen the patient with a catharsis, which pulls out all the stool that is in his intestines: for it often hinders the discovery of the stone during the investigation
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient is taken with his feet and is beaten, and is moved downwards: so that the stone may go down to the depth of the bladder, or come out from its high place somewhat
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and your hands are under his buttocks, so that the bladder may be completely emptied downwards
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then ask him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel the stone in the space, then act immediately with a cut above it
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not come under your touch at all, then you must remove the index finger of your left hand if the patient is a child: or the middle finger if he is an adult: and insert it into his rectum, and inquire about the stone, until it is under your finger: and gradually bring it up to the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then immediately above itself with your finger, and push it outwards against the site of the incision: and command the minister on your left hand, that he cut away the flesh of your left hand from above; and command another minister on your right hand, that he extend your testicles of your right hand upwards; and another of your hands, that he move the skin which is under your testicles in the part from the place of the incision.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then immediately insert the sponge, which has this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the uterus and the testicles, and not in the middle, at the side of the left hip: and let the incision be above the upper stone, and your finger be in the anus: and make the incision transverse, so that the external incision is wide, and the internal one is narrow, as much as is possible to prevent the escape of the stone from it not greater
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps therefore it compresses the finger which is in the anus the stone at the incision, and it comes out without difficulty
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that from the stone there are angles and margins, because of which it is difficult for it to come out on account of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is soft, like a gland, and round: and it makes its exit easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore add to it those which have angles and margins, in the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out like this, then you must take an instrument of good size over the upper part: or grasp it with your thumb which is like a crescent, which grasps the stone and does not slip from it: or that you introduce under it an instrument which is fine and flexible, curved at its extremities.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	Or if you cannot do this, then widen the opening a little more.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If blood flows to you from it, cut it off with a cautery.</start_of_turn>
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there is more than one stone, push in the first one to the os vesicae opening.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it (the stone).
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards push in the small one afterwards: and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If the big one is wide, then ignorance is like cutting above it with a large section
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For indeed, with two things a sick man is either dead or receives an excessive concentration of urine: because the place is not solidified at all
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But give him an emetic until it goes out: or break it with forceps until you have removed it frustratedly
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have finished the operation, then put on a sponge of wool, aloe and dragon's blood: and bind it tightly, and place above it a soaked bandage of oil and wine, or of rose water and cold water: so that the swelling will subside
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then keep the patient resting on his chest, and do not stretch the ligaments, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have healed it, bandage the place with much water and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with rue ointment and balm ointment, until it is healed
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however in the wound there is added a soft swelling and pus, and similar things: like when blood congeals in the bladder and is prohibited from going out by urine: and it is known from the discharge of blood with the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood clot.</start_of_turn>
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it causes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.</start_of_turn>
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then bathe the wound with vinegar, vinegar, and salt: and oppose every kind of dressing with that which is suitable for the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	It is necessary throughout the process of treatment, as you bind two thighs together, and unite them, the cause of the medicines which are placed above the place
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small, and is in the urine passage, and is fixed in it, and hinders the flow of urine: then treat it with that which I mentioned before you reach the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Many are excused from the section for this treatment, because I have proved it to be good
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take a perforator of iron, which has this form, triangular extremities, acute, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take thread, and bind with it the urine under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the perforating iron into the urine with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone: and withdraw the perforator from the stone little by little: and close the perforation of it, until you make it penetrate from the other side
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine will indeed vanish immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand over that which remains from the stone from the outside of the urine passage.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It will break itself, and go out with the urine, and the patient will be healed
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If, however, this treatment is not prepared for him, because of something which hinders it: then bind thread under the stone, and thread above the stone
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry over the stone in the urine between two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then suture the ligament and bind the frozen blood which is in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to pass the thread under the stone, except that it does not return to the orifice: and another ligament must be passed above, except that when the thread is drawn out after the stone has gone, the skin should return to its place and cohere with the wound: and for this reason it is necessary that you should pass the thread above when you elevate the skin to its proper position, so that the skin returns to its original place and coheres with the wound, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of the stone from women.</start_of_turn>
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.</start_of_turn
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	The stone is rarely generated in women.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If, however, it should happen to any of them to have a stone, then its cure is difficult, and is prohibited because of the many methods.</start_of_turn
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: perhaps the woman is a virgin.</start_of_turn
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who confesses herself to a physician when she is chaste, or from having had husbands.</start_of_turn
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman who is well-skilled in this art, especially in performing the operation with the hand.</start_of_turn
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance of the stone from the place: because it demands a deep incision, and there is fear in that.</start_of_turn
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	And if necessity compels you to do this, then you must take a female physician who is well-skilled: and it is rarely found.</start_of_turn
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If indeed you desire beforehand the secrets of this art, then seek out a learned and experienced physician, well-versed in women's matters, or one who has received instruction in this field. Do this immediately and especially request that he perform everything which he is commanded to do from the inquiry concerning the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, if she is a maid, he must insert his finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If he finds it, he should grasp it under his finger and then command the midwife to insert his finger into the lower belly of the patient and inquire about the stone, after placing his left hand over the flank and applying good pressure
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If he finds the stone, he must gradually move it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with all his skill, until it reaches the root of the hip bone.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should place his hand above the middle of the belly, at the root of the hip bone, from whichever side is most convenient for him, and he will feel the stone in that place: and his finger should not be moved from the stone, holding it under pressure: and make a small incision at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then insert the radium through that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he feels the stone, then add to the incision as much as the stone has gone out of it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	Among these there is a small one, a large one, a soft one and a rough one, a long one and a round one with a branch.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	You know therefore the kind of stone, as it is signified by this above all that you desire
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood flows there, then add in the hollow place a little of powder, and keep it for one hour, until the blood is separated.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to the operation, until the stone comes out: and make ready with the instruments which I mentioned in the extraction of the stone from the bladder, that you may assist with them in the present operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If blood flows there, and you know that the evacuation of blood comes from the artery which has been cut: then put powder over the place, and bind it with fine threads: and do not move it: and let the stone go, and do not take it out
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the woman is weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When blood sits still after days, and the place putrefies, then return to the operation, until the stone comes out
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Of the incision of the super Hernias of water
Caput LXII.	Chapter 122.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A swelling of water is not a hernia, except for the gathering of moisture in the white membrane which is under the testicles containing urine: and it is called a hernia.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in the inner sac of the testicles which nature has prepared for it in the part of the urine until it is put out: which is another egg, and is the white membrane of the testicles between the white membrane and the urine, which we mentioned: and it does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of these hernias is from the weakness which happens to the testicles: from which this matter flows out.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this humidity has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	And it is of various colors, some being like the yellow of the setting sun, others like bloody red, or like dung, black, or like pure water, and this is more of it.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs indicating the presence of moisture are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in white powder as we have said, then the swelling is round like a nut of about the size of a figure of the omega: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if it is in the natural membrane of the body itself, then the swelling is round with a part like the omega: and for this reason the man knows that it is another egg
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white powder, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When you see the consciousness of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the swelling with the introduction of a square whose form has preceded it
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that, therefore, as it comes out in the mark of the introduction, judge from that which is between them
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary to expel the morbid matter from the patient, to perform phlebotomy if possible, and to fill the body with liquids
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	And then it is placed upon its back over the high part and put under it many sponges.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	And then sit on its left side and command the attendant to sit on its right side, who extends the limb of its left side towards the two edges of the skin of the testicles and towards the part beyond the navel
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle towards the loin, until it reaches the navel: and make an incision according to the rule of the equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white powder encompassing: and scrape it out and observe, or cause it to bleed, in order to remove it: and do your scraping as carefully as possible from the part which hangs down with the egg more: and gradually scrape away with the scraping as much as you are able
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then perforate the full bladder with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the bladder upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles comprehending them: and pierce the bladder as you deem possible, either completely, or partly, especially its wide base superficially.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully scrutinize, in its incision there is no security, that the water will not leak out
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if anything exterior comes out from its cavity in the hour of your operation: then when you have completed the section of the bladder, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like the rest of the wounds, until it is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	And if you find anything corrupted from the blackness of anything else, then it is necessary that you bind the wounds, which are the suspension, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then remove the testicle with the suspension, and extract the thing: afterwards care for it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water is aggregated in two parts, then you know that there are two branches: dry therefore the other part equally
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if you make it equal, as for one operation, then do so: then drain the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the incisions a wet thread in oil, or in rose oil: and put outside the thread another thread which you submerged in wine and oil, and expand it over the two testicles, and look inside: and put over it doubled cloths, and they are sponges: and bind them up above with a ligature, which is having six according to this form
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are taken and the wound is covered, and the carmine is applied according to this resemblance: and the extremities which are sent out from the hip, or wet wool, are placed together with the stricture in the lumbar region of the arms. One extremity takes over one thumb up to the loin, and the second extremity takes over to the part of the pelvis. And two extremities take over two lower hips, and two extremities take over two groin, and the stricture is gathered up in the lumbar region of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when it is necessary to cauterize this wound artificially, with a knife at the place of the section with a iron: it is that you take the cautery with a fine handle and remove the skin of the testicles. And it is ignited, as we have said: until it is seen to detect the white fat containing water. Then take the cautery, according to this form.</start_of_turn>
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letters are similar.</start_of_turn>
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it through that fat, and it is ignited, until all the moisture has escaped.</start_of_turn
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch out the fat with hooks, and scour with the cautery which is ignited with a fine flame, and cut through itself as much as possible, until you have removed all of it.</start_of_turn
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And burn from outside, so that it does not touch the fire.</start_of_turn
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and more lasting than the operation with a section.</start_of_turn
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If however you make a mistake in the hour of the section, or in the hour of the cautery after the pus has become cold, or there is a flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary to cure the mistake which you have made from that with the treatment which is suitable for it, according to what has been said.</start_of_turn
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect such an operation on account of his horror: then I shall perform the perforation as I have narrated.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain that it is necessary to do so according to what we have said concerning the signification of the matter, which is that the water is slack: then you must make the patient sit on a raised seat
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then I shall perforate the lower part of the abdomen with a wide spatula: and I shall perform the perforation in the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until the water has flowed out completely
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then I shall place upon the place of the buttocks, and I shall ligate it, and I shall let the remainder of the water flow out: then I shall care for the wound until the wound has healed
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is an opposition to the flow of the water at the hour when I perforate: and this is not except because there is a white clot which hinders the exit of the water at the opening of the wound: then it is necessary that I insert a sponge into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of life is extracted, whose form has preceded: or that I make an addition to the operation of the wound by means of a small incision.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it has thus accumulated, then it is necessary to perform the operation again in the same manner, and the patient will be able to pass his days in peace.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	¶ On the care of the carnosae branch.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You know that in the section above this Ramus, there is from excessive fear a cause of cowardice in many situations.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore its discharge of salary from this is seen to be delayed
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	I am mindful of the operation and the kind of post-operative care.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	Indeed, many post-operative complications arise in the bodies from which testicles are composed: and this is due to many wounds, namely.</start_of_turn>
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute or severe inflammation which oozes towards the testicles.</start_of_turn>
Aut ex percussione.	Or from blows.</start_of_turn
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	The colour of the post-operative condition is that of the body and not of pain: and it is a serious complication.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony post-operative condition, the colour of which is dark, and there is no sensation in it.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is from the swelling of arteries and veins: just as it was mentioned above concerning its remembrance: or from the swelling of the veins.</start_of_turn>
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	And that is known by the arrangement of the post-operative condition when you press on it with your fingers.</start_of_turn
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it does not behove you to grasp it directly.</start_of_turn
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That is because it is due to the swelling of the veins, it does not disperse from that by pressing on it with your fingers.</start_of_turn
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible that in this way an incision will be made over this kind and over the rest of the body: and it is as if you were cutting the skin of the testicles.</start_of_turn
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the thumb upwards and extract it with a white bandage: and free the testicle from the scrotum, and ligate the veins: and cut through the scrotum after you have freed it from all parts of the thumb.</start_of_turn
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If any bone is consolidated with these bones, then it is necessary to draw out the bone and cut it through.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	If an adhesion has taken place between some of the bones, or in that which is between the ribs: then it is necessary to free the whole adhesion and cut it through with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If there is a natural bone in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut through the whole of it, and draw out the bone, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When the operation is complete, then put a sponge soaked in vinegar in the wound, and wine: then care for it with the rest of the care, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	About the care of bones, which is with oil.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 122.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Inflammation is a swelling of the bone which is surrounded by swelling, like a bag, with softening of the testicles: and it makes difficult the walking and the exercise, and the gait.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the care of this ailment is fear, because of the remembrance of that which preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	It is true that we must say that the operation is to be done as the first did it.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, therefore, that it is necessary to make the sick man sit upon a raised seat
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then drive the suspension of the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the testicles with your fingers, with the nails towards the veins: and hold it by another person, and extend it with an extension of the limb
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a sharp knife of the kind which has a straight blade in the middle of the veins, until the veins are detected
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then from all sides remove the [excoria], as we said before in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temper.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in place an awl in the place where the doubled thread lies, and bind it at the first point where the veins happen to be: and bind it again at the last of these.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them in the middle section straight according to the length of the body, and extract what accumulates from the moist humours of corrupt faeces.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wound with the care of the other wounds, in which one wishes to generate health, so that the bad things that feed one testicle may fall away
Non est enim malum per illud.	There is no bad thing for that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if the veins happen to be brought together by all the veins, then it is necessary to extract the testicles with the veins: so that they do not be deprived of nourishment by the incision, and that they do not become putrefied, or become black, and be useless with the wound
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the care of the intestines.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The event of this Ramus is from the section which happens in the great siphons above the belly in the part of the groin from the wonder of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	This rupture is either from the siphons or from the expansion of this
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds happen from many causes: either from a blow, or from a jump, or from a cry, or from the elevation of a heavy thing, and the like
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from the expansion of the siphons
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	That which occurs gradually in a long time, and does not happen immediately, is an equal aftereffect throughout its depth: because it compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	When it is excised from the portion of the intestine which lies immediately beneath the surface of the skin, the pain instantly increases at its commencement: and the aftereffect is variable, being apparent on the surface of the skin immediately beneath: because of the extrusion of the intestine through the opening of the siphons
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	When it is extruded with the intestine, it is called intestinal hernia and swelling: and sometimes it is associated with swelling.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	When it runs into the intestine, stool remains there: and this is with great pain: because it makes the pain severe, especially when it is pressed out.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of such diseases of the intestines, fear of death is present: wherefore it is necessary to guard against its occurrence.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	The method of operation is to expel the major part of the intestine into the depths of the cavity, if it obeys its return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it is returned over its column between your hands: and lift the limbs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then spread out the skin following the skin upwards, and dry the whole of the scrotum thoroughly
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix in two incisions the hooks of the section of the intestines, according as it is necessary to open the section with them: and the incision should be made according to the quantity, as much as is possible, so that it may be easily evacuated from it
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then cleanse the siphons and those which are under the skin until the white intestine is detected, hard throughout: then introduce your finger of indication into that which follows the testicle, which is between the white siphons, which is under the skin, and the second siphons, and the whole together with that which adheres to it at the back of the testicles.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move your right hand towards the inside of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend a white patch upwards with your left hand: and elevate one with the patch towards the part of the section: and command the minister to extend one upwards: and you shall solve the adherence, which is the complete reverse solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	Inquire your fingers, that nothing be there in the white patch hard or soft from the intestine
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find anything in it: then drive it down to the lower belly
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take hold of a needle, which has a thick thread made of ten threads: and insert it through the back of the white patch, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the section: then cut off the extremities which project from the thread, until there remain four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then make a figure-of-eight with some of them over some: and ligate with two threads, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles a strong ligament which does not permit anything to pass through it: so that there may not arise from this a cold abscess.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again a ligament outside the first ligament, long enough to be less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments draw out from the white patch, which is under the skin of the testicles, as much as the length of a finger: and cut off the rest entirely following the roundness, and take out from it one
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry the lower part of the skin of the testicles section from which blood runs, and heal: as we have narrated above.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wet wool under oil, and put it in a wound: and administer the ligament which we have mentioned
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white fat is cauterized, after its incision, fear lest there be bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Much of the time, this happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	Discharge the ligament until it falls away by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, its case is delayed, then it is bound with warm water: and place over that which we mentioned before, until it falls away.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the rest of the treatment of wounds, until it heals
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Of a swelling wound.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In such a swelling, do not allow anyone to attempt to cure it with fire
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first of all they say that it is like what we have narrated concerning the swelling which is with the Vite.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, as a bandage is bound up after its section below the surface: then dry in the middle, and care afterwards with that which opens it up, until the fat falls away: and care for the wound, as we have mentioned before, until it is healed
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Of the disruption which happens in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture happens in the groin, as we have mentioned, and the place protrudes, and does not descend to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it descends, it is little, and returns in every hour: truly if this prolongates with time, there is added a fissure in the fat, until the intestines descend into the fat
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the fat, which is in the groin, as we have mentioned
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	When the swelling has been extended, it is softened, and the place relaxes, and it emerges.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	Its care is with cautery, as it was mentioned previously.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is cured with iron, in this way: the patient lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture after it has relaxed and emerged, by cutting across its width, according to the quantity of three fingers wide
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the swelling and those which are under the skin, until the white swelling is detected, which is under the skin following the latter.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then grasp the radium and place it over the protruding part of the swelling, and press it deep into the belly
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then take two points of prominence on the extremity of the radium from the swelling, and connect them with a suture: then withdraw the extremity of the radium.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the swelling at all, neither tear any skin, nor anything else, as I told you in the care of intestinal branches
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then care for this wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have finished cutting the thread, soften this and restore the wound, until it is consolidated
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	Let the swelling subside, and do not add to the prominence of the rupture
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to the vein.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	About the softening of the skin of testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of testicles is softened in many people, because the meat which is between them is softened, and the appearance of this becomes spoiled.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asking for care of his health, to make the patient lie upon his back, and to cut through the entire skin which has been softened upon the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	And then two lips are to be gathered together with sutures: and if desired, blood should be let out at first from the surplus of softened skin by means of three or four sutures, and then firmly suture
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	And then cut through between the sutures
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	And then care for the remaining wounds until they are healed, and the thread is cast off.
¶ De Castratione.	(The text continues with a section on castration.)
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that castration is forbidden in our law: and for that reason I will not mention it in this book: and it is not necessary to mention it, except for two cases.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	Of which one is that it is in the science of medicine when it is inquired about: and to know its treatment when it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other case is that we often need castration for some animals, because of our desires concerning them, such as asses, hinds, and cats, and the like of animals
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by cutting off.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision, and cutting through
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In which way, however, which is done by attrition, the operation is this: that we make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down: and then cut off the testicles with your hand, until they are resolved and do not appear to the touch
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	In castration, however, through incision and section, it is necessary to keep the animal still, and to clamp the skin of the testicles with the left hand.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that by attrition: for the attrition may perhaps leave something behind from the testicles, which the animal desires to have coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound, until it has healed.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	There are two methods for caring for the hermaphrodite.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from two [things] according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is that it appears in it what follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in which there is a figure like a woman's vulva, having hair: and sometimes urine comes from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women there is one kind, which is the woman's vulva which is on the belly like the testicles of a small man, protruding outwards: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the care of the three kinds, of two from the males and one from the females, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until the impression of them has fled
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for the rest of the wounds
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	As for the second kind of hermaphroditism, from which urine comes from the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, neither is there any care for it at all
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the incision of the Tentiginis, and the protruding flesh in the female pelvis.
Caput LXXI.	On the incision of the Tentiginis, and the protruding flesh in the female pelvis.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The Tentiginis may perhaps be added above what is natural, until it becomes swollen and unsightly: and sometimes it is also greatly enlarged in some women, until it extends as far as the groin.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary therefore to ligate the superflous Tentiginis, either with a ligature or with a single suture, and to make the incision: and do not reach the deepest root, especially as the blood supply is liable to be disturbed
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound itself, until it is healed
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the flesh which arises in the orifice of the womb, until it has been expelled: and perhaps it comes out to the exterior like the tail: and for this reason some call it caudal fistula.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore to make an incision like that of the Tentiginis, and to take care of it, until it is healed
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Of the care of the Alratica, which is the unperforated vulva of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Of the care of the Alratica, which is the unperforated vulva of a woman
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The Alratica is, as it is the unperforated vulva of a woman, or as there is a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	It is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	It is accidental from some ailment which preceded it: and sometimes it is caused either by the addition of fleshy tissue, or by fine sand or hair, or by swelling: and it may be either in the depths of the womb, or in the flanks, or above or below: and it hinders coitus and conception, and delivery, and perhaps menstruation itself
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	Knowledge of that is obtained by the aspect of the obstetrician, if the opening appears close at hand.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If it is not apparent, then seek with your fingers or with an instrument.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the opening is from a thin layer of fat, and is close to the two lips: then grasp firmly, and break it through.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is like putting over two lips little nails.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your two fingers of both hands together, and the woman should sit with her buttocks expanded over her thighs.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the thin layer of fat is broken through, and the opening is made.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then grasp the lanet and soak it in oil, and place it on the place: and the woman should continue to press daily, so that it does not solidify in another place.</start_of_turn>
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the layer of fat is thick and tough: then it is necessary to cut it out with a spatula like a broad leaf of myrtle.</start_of_turn
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however the opening is from natural flesh: then suspend the bleeding with hooks, and cut through it: and let there be with you physicians who can stop the flow of blood without causing harm, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus gather with alum or wool.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a large lead cannula, so that the wound does not close up too quickly, keep it for a few days: and administer dry lint, then care for the rest, until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when there is birth in the matrix of other meats: it is necessary therefore that they be cut through in this manner: as there is no cancerous tumor in the matrix, let there be no resistance with iron of any kind.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red kind in the veins of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red kind in the veins of women.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed swellings of the veins of the rectum or anus, from which much blood flows excessively.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids exist, there are two things which must be known: the kind of hemorrhoids and the signs of the disease. We will speak of the treatment of these things later; now let us speak of what is necessary and what is not
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore that hemorrhoids which exist in the belly and not in the anus are not treated with iron
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those which exist in the belly above which there is no sensation are those which are cured
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that the woman be put into a cold house
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then stretch out Athehelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut away the roots from them.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over the wounds with one of the powders mentioned above without causing damage: thus, as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her in cold water afterwards
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the bleeding persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and nutmeg, and gall, and similar things
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood is still bleeding with this, it is good: and if not, make the swelling adhere to the skin, and butter, without making an incision
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and soak it in grease of lard, or in grease of arnica, or in grease of poppy seeds, that is, lanolin, wine of pontic, and cause it to adhere to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the wound is quiesced, then care for the place with unguents until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	However red it is like heads of hair, and has a rough appearance.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut away that which appears from it, as I have said previously: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Of the perforation which happens in the matrix.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.</start_of_turn
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of wounds happen in the matrix, such as cancer, and stone abscess, and ulcer, and foreign bodies, and swellings, that is, herpes, fistula, and hemorrhoids, and piles, and tumors, and abscesses.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already said all these diseases and their kinds, and their signs, and their treatments in general: it is necessary to say in this treatise the abscess which happens in the matrix, when it is from wounds which join health, and how it is opened with a knife.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	You must consider this.</start_of_turn>
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	When the pain of the wound in its beginning is acute with percussion, flame, and fever: and you see it turning red: if it falls outside of your senses, then do not attempt to pierce it: care for it so that the acute pain of the accident subsides, until the cause of the pain has disappeared.</start_of_turn
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is fitting that you make her sit upon a seat which beats two seats, and that she recline, or that you support her upon her back, and that she bring her feet to the lower part of her belly: and that her knees be spread wide, and that she place her arms under her knees, and that you bind each ligament conveniently to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and manage the instrument with which you open the opening of the womb.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes into being in the things that are afterwards
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is fitting when you are about to manage this instrument that you place the liver with the rib of the deep belly of the woman: so that there is not that which enters from the instrument more than the depth of the belly, and that it does not damage the lower part
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is greater than the depth of the belly, then you must place sponges upon the covering of the deep belly: so that the entrance of the instrument is not introduced into the depth of the belly: and you must place a sponge, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that you keep the instrument firm, and that you rotate the minister of the sponge until the depth of the belly is opened
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and the hand touches it, and it is soft and gentle: then it is fitting that you cut it off at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the blood is evacuated, then it is fitting that you place in the wound a sponge soaked in rose-water: or a sponge of green, in which there is some astringency: and put on the sponge and draw out the section from the depth of the belly.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally upon the matrix, and upon the navel a wet towel soaked in water, in which there are bad bubbles.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it cares for two days with ointment which agrees with it until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	When it has bathed the matrix and the wound, it is to be plastered with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound has receded inwards of the matrix, then it is necessary to protect it from its cure with iron, and to care for it as we said in the direction of the wound.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The obstetrical doctrine, concerning how to care for the embryos of women, according to an unnatural form of birth.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LX.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know in the first place the figure of natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From the signs therefore it is known that when a woman is pressed by the waters below and wishes to smell the air, and alleviates above what is above her from the birth, and hastens the issue of the embryo: then you know that this birth is natural, and is the issue above its head, and the second with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore these signs are present, then it is necessary to compress the womb so that the embryo comes down quickly
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends above its head, it descends with the second part and is delivered from these superabundances by a good delivery
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever is beyond this birth is unnatural, harmful
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus comes out above its feet, and the body of it goes before the head, and the feet and hands together, or one foot: or the head and the hand: or the belly: and perhaps turns upon its collar, and similar things from the harmful figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent, cautious in all these matters, and to beware of error and decomposition: for I shall show every figure and how the temperament is in each one, and it is signified by that, and it stands above itself.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus has gone beyond its head during its natural egress, and the head becomes engaged above the woman, and delivery becomes difficult, and the power of its courage is being crippled: then let the woman sit down, or let the women hold her up: and let the vapor of her breath be driven away with fumigation of rue and with oily substances.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Obstetrician inserts his fingers between the toes of the patient, and finds the second one, and seizes it with his nail, until he has drawn out what is in it from the moisture: and he presses down the belly of the woman until the fetus comes down.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not come down, then it is necessary to instill the woman with a cathartic of rue with oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her to drink after the catharsis, that she may compress: and make her lie down with her chin resting on her chest for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come out at once, it is necessary to reduce them gradually with ease
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not obey in the birth, then let the woman sit down and elevate her feet above the ground: then press down on her seat towards the earth: and the woman shall be held, so that she does not fall from the concussion
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If, however, the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut down the sides and extract the fetus: and bind up the hand with cloth, and extract it with evenness: for it will come out itself
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The embryo's exit is above its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus exits above its feet, it is necessary to drive it upwards: then gradually bend it: afterwards it will be even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take hold of one foot and gradually extend it
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they emerge up to the hips, then command it to bend down, so that it will be crushed, and make it exhale with force: it will come out, God willing
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out as we have said, then gradually reduce the fetus until you have set it according to its natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will come out by itself when its time comes.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is delayed as regards all that we have said: then take from the thick mucus above, and salt, and gum dissolved: and pierce all through in the belly with a good blow: then draw out with the woman's palm and the lower part of her belly
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make it sit in warm water, until the afterbirth follows naturally
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When its lower parts are softened by the heat, then make for it a sieve of myrrh: and hold it in place.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When an hour has passed since you put on the sieve, then make it sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make it exhale: and stretch its bones and nose: and press the lower part of the belly gently
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The fetus's exit is above the knees and hands
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out in this form, then gently bend in its hands little by little.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman lies upon her pillar, and her feet hang down towards the lower parts: and she herself lies upon the bed, and she covers her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then she slowly raises her abdomen upwards
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then she pulls out what is under her feet from the shoes, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then grasp her feet and move them with a gentle movement.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then slowly press what is above the navel upwards, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert your hands and gently deliver the fetus: and command the woman to press, until the fetus comes out
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The lateral delivery of the fetus hangs from the hands
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Skill in the reduction of the hand is required
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If, however, it is not possible to reduce the hand, then lift up the woman and make her walk
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she is unable to walk, then make her lie upon the bed: and compress her limbs with a gentle touch
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment that you have prepared from the slime-coats
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she gives birth, then make her sit on a seat
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study the reduction of the hand, and equal the fetus according to the natural figure: and command the woman to breathe steadily, and tell her to press herself, until she comes out
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus comes out upon her pillar, with her hands spread out, and her face is towards the back of her mother
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The obstetrician must hold the hand of the fetus firmly, then gradually withdraw it, and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equal, then place above its belly what we have mentioned from wax and mucus
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command it to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then make it sit on its seat, and command it to incline to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command it to compress: and make it breathe with composure.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The fetus is prepared to exit through the side
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it has descended to the birth opening in this way with the second finger, then cut the second with your nail, until it is evacuated from the moisture
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended on the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inwards, until you have placed it according to what is required: and command the woman to compress herself slightly: it will itself go out through the easy exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The birth of twins, or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are often born multiple: and sometimes three or four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	It is an extraordinary thing, and is rarely found.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five or more is a thing beyond nature, and does not usually survive: and they are retained together, although multiplied, by one: and they are separated by the navel, distinguishing between the cord of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they go out like a single fetus through a natural exit, easily: and they go out through the difficult exit, as we have narrated
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If anything is difficult with regard to parts, and they approach that which we mentioned from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have narrated: and let the midwife be gentle, and let her do what she does with ease and delay, and she shall adapt according to every figure as she prepares for it from the guiding principle for health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and that aborts.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and I have seen that a woman has aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of whom were formed
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	As has been done by the measurement of a wise man
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore all this must be known in the science of Midwifery
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps indeed it will approach like that: oppose to it what is necessary
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Of the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus with that which I said in the discourse on medication, and it does not go out, and you must perform an operation with the hand, then you must consider carefully
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If a woman is of sound virtue and is not with any of the things from which she is afraid that she will lose the child: then it must be that the woman lies over the bed, over her back, and that her head is inclined downwards, and her legs are elevated: and the midwife must hold the child from two parts, or it is bound to the bed, so that it is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the os matrice from oily humids with mucilage of alum, and chaff, and linseed seed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the Obstetrix shall smear his hand with oil and mucus: then he shall introduce it into the matrix with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he seeks the place where the nails of the fetus are fixed, and the convenient place for it
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend over its head: then fix the nails in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its chest, or under its ribs.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If, however, the descent is over its feet, then in the loin and the middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that he grasp the nail with his right hand: and he shall place his thumb in that which is between the little finger of the left hand: and he shall introduce it with his hand with ease, and fix the nail in some one of those places which we mentioned, until it reaches the desired thing
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he shall fix the other nail, or the third, if necessary: so that there is an equal tension, and it does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then the extension should be equal, and it should not be extended only in a straight line, but should be moved to all parts, so as to alleviate its exit: as it is done with a tooth at its extraction
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary at that place between these, so as to soften the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if it is retained from that place, then the Obstetrix must smear some fingers with oil, and introduce them from the side, so as to rotate with what is retained
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If, however, a part of the fetus comes out, then exchange the nails to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand goes out before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its swelling: then it is necessary that it be covered over the bandage.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	If therefore the hand goes out before the others, incides on the skin or in the joint of the limb, or in the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you make in the other hand, and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the fetus's head is large, or if it has become coarticulated in the birth, or there is water in its head: then it is necessary that you introduce between the fingers the Spatumile spinosum, and find it with the head, and extract the water: or break it with the instrument which is called the Almisdac, whose form is like that of the other instruments in the following chapter.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise do in case the fetus has a large head of natural birth, then it is necessary that you remove the afterbirth: or extract it with a hook, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then grasp the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	When the head comes out, and is grasped at the collar: then it is found, until the moisture that is in the chest is drained out
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	When it does not become complicated, nor does it yield to delivery: then cut off the head roughly, as much as is possible to you
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	When the lower belly is apostemated, or there is fluid in it: then it is necessary that you perforate it, until the moisture comes out from it
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If however the fetus is on his feet: then the traction of his belly is easy, and the direction of it towards the maternal bones is smooth.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is coarticulated at the belly, or the chest: then it is necessary that you extract it with the bandage which you have put over your hand: and find the belly, or the chest, until it is drained out
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If, however, the other members are removed and the head remains: then the Obstetrix inserts his left hand into the head.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the mouth of the womb is open: then he inserts his hand deeply into the womb and grasps the head, and pulls it down to the opening of the womb. Then he inserts one or two fingers into it and pulls them out with it.</start_of_turn>
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the opening of the womb is closed, because of a thick clot that has occurred to it: then it is not necessary to work above it, indeed it is necessary to manage an effusion of humors, fat: and apply plasters. And sit in waters which soften and moisten.</start_of_turn>
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is above its side: then it is possible to equalize it: then it is administered what we said in the fetus above.</start_of_turn>
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do this, then it is done by force, and it is extracted.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not allow anything to go out from the belly altogether.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have finished your operation, then administer what we said in the postpartum period which occur in the womb.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there is a flow of blood, then descend into the waters of styptics, and administer the remaining treatment.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have seen a woman in whom there was a dead fetus in the womb: then it was impregnated over her with another, afterwards another fetus also died.</start_of_turn
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	This happened to her after a long time the clot in her belly burst open: and it became swollen, until it opened: and pus began to emit.</start_of_turn
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I am summoned here for his care, and I have been his physician for a long time: and it is not consolidated (healed).
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I place upon him above some strong sticking plaster: and it has come out of its place from the bone
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then some days passed by, and it came out of another place from the bone.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I am amazed that there is no bone within.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I think that because there were dead bones of a fetus there
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I inquired about the wound, and I extracted many bones, the woman being in better dispositions: and it has healed in the long term, and there comes out little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not stabilize this externally, except that there is knowledge of it, and assistance with this, which the artificial doctor administers with his hand in care.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of the necessary instruments for the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.</start_of_turn>
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Strictor, with which books are equal, to which are equal two rings in the two extremities of two logs.</start_of_turn>
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	Truly, this vertigo must be finer than the strictor: and that it may be either from ebony or from seasoned wood.</start_of_turn
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of every log is like two fingers: and the margin of each of them is like one finger, and the length of each of them is palm and a half: and in the middle of the two logs are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are firmly fixed in both, of whose length is half of the palm and a little less: and the width of each is like two fingers, or less.</start_of_turn
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	Two additional things are introduced into the matrix bone, so that it opens when you rotate two vertebrae.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Two additional things are introduced into the matrix bone, so that it opens when you rotate two vertebrae.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Two additional things are introduced into the matrix bone, so that it opens when you rotate two vertebrae.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Two additional things are introduced into the matrix bone, so that it opens when you rotate two vertebrae
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	Two additional things are introduced into the matrix bone, so that it opens when you rotate two vertebrae. The length of each additional thing is like a palm, and their width is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you have thus opened the matrix with these two things, then make the woman sit on a stool, with her feet hanging down, and open what is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two things together into the matrix: and you hold the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, like you do with pliers, equally according to the quantity that you wish to open the opening of the matrix, until the Obstetrix does what he wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The other form of the Vertebra is called the Form of Impulsion which drives out the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of the Almside, which contains the large head: and it is assimilated to the forceps, which have teeth at the end, like these things
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is flattened, like the forceps according to this form, like these things, which have teeth like saw teeth, with which it incides and contains

Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of the spatula having two extremities to clamp the head
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of two spatulas also the handles.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used, and the more numerous their kinds and well prepared they are in the artificer's hand, the more rapid is the operation and the higher among men because of their quantity
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	There must not be disdain for any of these instruments, because they are prepared for you
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	Unnecessary is their absence indeed.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Of the extraction of the second (tooth).
Caput LXXVIII.	Head seventy-eighth.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second is retained at delivery, then it is necessary to extract the lower incisors in order to retain its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make a scar with the forceps: and stretch your hand over the bone of it, and keep your breath.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it comes out through this, that is good
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take hold of the bone, and pierce at the apex of the socket: and put in it herbs that soften the bone, such as rue, rhubarb, chamomile, and aloe, and poppy seeds, and saffron, and cassia gum, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and soak them in water, and put them over fire
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put an embolus of bulrush over the socket of the tooth, and the other extremity in the bone of the jaw: and keep it there until the vapor has gone up to the cavity of the jaw
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make the incision as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	It will then come out easily enough.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If, however, it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then command the Obstetrician to put his hand into the belly and press with the thumb on the navel or with the thick mucus of the elder days.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then introduce the hand into the belly and seek with it the Second [a vein].
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When you have found it, then grasp it and gradually extend it outwards
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If, however, it is attached deep in the belly, then introduce the hand as we have said until you find the Second. Then gradually withdraw it outwards along a straight line, so that the belly does not tear from the pulling force: indeed it is necessary to change the position with ease to the right and left sides: then add to the degree of tension as required
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	The wound will then obey and will be cured, and will go away from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the belly is closed as we have said: treat the wound with incision and with ointment with herbs
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it does not come out with all that we have said: do not be rash in your handling of the wound.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Indeed it is necessary that it come out to the opening of the belly from the woman's waist.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then close the wound with four drugs ointment
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	The wound itself will putrefy the wound after a few days, and will dissolve and go away.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	Indeed when it putrefies, it will emit a bad odor from the belly and head, and will cause pain which will bring on weakness
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary therefore that appropriate fumigationations be administered for that.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients are experts in fumigation with naphtha and dry figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The manner of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated at the retention of the second and the menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be like an umbrella from the back: or from the heel: and put the wide end over the flame: and let the fumigation be placed over the berries: hold it until the fumigation is consumed: and do it again

Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.

¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 8.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The fistulas which arise in the lower part are Nodatio and Grossitudo which happen close to the bones of the limb: either in the space of one part or in several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When the Nodatio is old, it opens, and white watery moisture or fine pus runs from it
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these Fistulas are penetrating
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore the penetrating ones are recognized by the fact that they issue from discharge and swelling, when the patient uses the egestion: and perhaps they issue from worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And these are the kinds of Fistulas when they are penetrating until they reach the bone and the marrow of the limb
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating until they reach the hip joint and the tail bone node
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this it is known that a penetrating Fistula until it reaches the limb is also not penetrating, as when you put your finger into the limb: and you put in a needle fine in the Fistula from the air or from the iron, when there is no swelling.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	When there is swelling in this, then put in the needle fine from lead or horsehair until you feel the needle, or put in the hair in your finger
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel the needle itself, neither does it go out from the discharge, nor swelling, nor worms as I said: then you know that it is not penetrating: so proceed to the treatment then
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the Fistula is penetrating until it reaches the bone or the bladder: then the significance of it is the discharge of urine from it, and the prohibition of this until it is consolidated with the physicians.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If the wound extends up to the hip joint or the hip bone: then its sign is that the limb will hang down, if there is no twist in it up to the bone: and there will be pain in the surrounding parts, and pus will always come from it; and no remedy will be of any avail, neither will it be consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	In all such penetrating wounds there is no cure: the cure for them is toil and perseverance, from the stupid doctors on whom they are formed.</start_of_turn>
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in those which are neither penetrating nor old, healing is hoped for with rest: as I have already said, and as I have shown: that the sick man should lie between your hands over his back, and elevate his limbs up to above his hips, and that his thighs should be inclined towards his belly.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce lead or air, if there is a twist in the wound, until you know where the limb hangs.</start_of_turn>
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the sick man feels about his limb: then it is necessary to insert your finger into the wound.</start_of_turn
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If you feel in your finger that the limb is being pierced by itself, as well as between your finger and the flesh, or bone: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: there is no labour in this, for it is not its cure, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They say that in some people the wound heals by itself, and from the medicine which is expected to help: that is, to apply a gentle cautery according to the size of the wound, as has been said before, and to insert the cautery into the wound until it hangs around the limb.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice or thrice until you know that all those meats added to the filter are now soft like the quills of a bird.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then keep it covered with butter with cloths until the meats have gone out: then keep it with the things which generate the flesh and solidify it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If thus it is healed, that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, it will not be healed by any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	If it comes out and does not reach the finger which is in the anus, which is between the thumb and the great toe of the foot, and there is some thick flesh of meat between the thumb and the great toe of the foot, or fat: then make an opening in the skin following the line of the fistula, and dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula until the end of the fistula is reached, and you dry with the thumb which is in the fistula until the end of the fistula is reached, and the thumb will be freed and fall out
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then soften those meats which are like the quills of a bird which have been added to the filter, so that nothing remains of them
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood boils up and mixes with you and the operation, so that you must cut away those meats: then it is better that you cauterize with fire or with acute medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cauterization with fire brings together good habits, brings about the softening of those meats which have been added, and cuts off the blood, and dries up the humours.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then keep it covered with butter with cloths, or with bruised figs, until pus comes out, and the softened meats go out in the pus
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then keep it with the things which solidify and consolidate, which generate flesh firmly: and these are the medicines which have styptic and drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	When restoration is complete, then healing takes place: and not by repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	When, however, a fistula persists right through to the depth of the rectum, and is prolonged by excessive body fat: then insert your finger into the rectum and inquire concerning it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If, therefore, you feel tension and between you and the fistula there is something soft, or fleshly, and it is close to the penetration: then there is no operation in that place, except according to the measure of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	For in that case one must employ three methods: or one cauterizes the fistula itself, as we have said: or one severs the vein, until you have achieved the subsidence of its swelling, so that it is possible for you to insert instruments, and to effect a cure from the next time
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with the incision, lest you cut through the membrane containing the rectum, and cause an excessive discharge of feces without your wish
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for that which we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps indeed it will heal: or you will lengthen the vein which we have mentioned, and cleanse it after you have dried it up to the rectum, as we have said, or with the finger, or with some acute instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then remove the fatty tissues which are in the incision, until the bone is found with careful probing.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt to restore the entire wound with the incision, and the upper orifice where it is consolidated: and the fistula will remain open in the inner part of the rectum, and will be less painful
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when you suture the fistula in this way: that is, when you insert your finger into the fistula: and it is on the side of the rectum around the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the rectum: then grasp the edge of the perforation, which is like a needle with a handle, that is, prepared to pierce the skin, in this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into the loop the twisted thread from the five threads, and surround it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	And introduce the needle with the thread into the pocket, until it follows the curvature of the latter.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it is piercing through the inner margin of the anus close to the rectum, then withdraw the thread from that hole: thus you will introduce your finger into the rectum, and withdraw the end of the thread, and gather together both ends: and tighten both of them, and let go of that day, or two days: and the more the thread has gone into the flesh, tighten it well, until those pieces of flesh which are between the two ends of the thread have fallen away: then care for the wound, until it is healed, and restored to health.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the opening of the pocket is not piercing: then make it pierce in whatever way you prepare it, except that it should not be too deep
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	It is not to be, that you make it pierce because of the wound, lest you should damage it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do as we have said, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.

Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are within the rectum, similar to the stones of dates or plums: or as if they were like the seeds of wheat.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	There are both small and large intestines: and blood always flows from the intestines. They are one and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	They are outside the belly and at their extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	Indeed those which are outside the belly are mostly small intestines, from which flows clear urine or a little blood slowly: and they are of the colour of the body itself
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of the one inside the belly is that you must urge the sick person to cough: and he will vomit, until the anus is expelled, and you will see little of it.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore hold him back with hooks: or grasp him with your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut through his bowels at their roots
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they do not remain in the belly with the ligatures, because of the moisture of their own and their softening: then cover them with coarse cloth, or with felt from a bag of wool, and draw them out with your fingers
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut through the bowels, and sprinkle upon them after cutting whatever fine powder is warm, so that the belly may remain in its place like a burn
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was said in the chapter on cauterization
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the bowels until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	And if the anus does not readily evacuate, then instill the sick person with a cathartic in the belly where there is a little pain, so that he may evacuate more quickly, when he feels the urge to do so
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however little things are outside the anus, then the matter is light and easy: and it is as if you were to grasp the intestines with your finger, or grasp them with a ligature, and cut through them
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever shuns incision with the iron, then it is necessary to manage the suture for him in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the thread that has been loosed, and pass it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then withdraw the needle upwards, and make it penetrate with the point at the root of it from the opposite side: and pass through two extremities of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be parallel: and tighten the knot firmly
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and withdraw the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the needles, and let go of one: neither leave it in, lest it cause excess bleeding.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place above the wound a soaked sponge in rosewater, or vinegar, and place it over the wound: and command the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let go of it until it falls off
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When they have fallen out, care for them with unguents, and leave the treatment until they are healed.

Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they have occurred like this, and do not yield to medical treatment: then it is necessary to grasp with the point of the spatula, or with your finger, until they become soft, and remove from the skin the outer layer which hinders healing.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they consolidate as they should
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If, however, they do not consolidate: then repeat the process of grasping with the greater reason than before, until they bleed profusely, and are then cleansed with care until they are healed

Caput LXXXII.	Of the treatment of boils of the flesh, not of the flesh: and of simple carbuncles and ants.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You know that a boil is not anything except a round knot according to the colour of the body, like a nail head: and it happens throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and the fingers: and it arises from an inflammation of the flesh at walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore that the surrounding nail be cut away, and held with pliers or with a needle, and be plucked out from its root
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for it: and if you wish you may cauterize it according to what has been said in its chapter
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	But as for simple carbuncles there is one which is a small, rough, filtered, round elevation above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur in the hands of children
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the treatment of it is to extend the carbuncle and cut it out: or to ligate it with a silken thread or with hair until it falls out
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said above with fire, or with acute medicine: and thus the inward boils are eradicated, and not the outward ones with the instrument which I have mentioned
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	As for ants there is also a small, filtered elevation, large, above the surface of the body, which swells inwards to the depth of the wound: and when it comes into contact with cold, it feels like the bite of an ant, and it happens throughout the body: and most of them happen in the hands
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the treatment of it is to take a thorn from the claw of a bird, or a strong bristle: and put it over the ant, until the circle of the bristle encompasses the ant.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then withdraw your hand with the cannula until you have severed what is around the ant: and place the needle in the depth of the flesh, and pull out the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	Or if you wish, do this with an air or iron cannula, according to this form.</start_of_turn>

Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when they are made from these instruments, both small and large, according to those in which they are administered.</start_of_turn
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Thus what is administered in the treatment of young children with soft lungs, is small: and for those whose souls are weak or painful, thus also the Clistera of these.</start_of_turn
Clistere magnum.	Large Clistera.</start_of_turn
Cistere paruum.	Small Clistera.</start_of_turn
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The cannula, that is, the upper part which is bound to the uterus, is to be wide according to this manner: and there should be a distinction so that the uterus is bound like water, and the lower part which enters the belly should be solid, that is, not open, soft, yielding, drawing towards thinness: and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side one hole.</start_of_turn
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	The breadth of the hole should be according to the length of the rays, and somewhat greater; and let there be a socket in which to place the medical instruments from the animal's body: or from parchment paper, which is according to the form of the asofrat of a date.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	The hole is pierced with many holes as it is rotated, and there is space between each hole as wide as a finger
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into the holes a strong thread of gut, which is from ten threads, or thereabouts, and bind it together like the asofrat of a date
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When it is thus placed in the socket, it is bound at the head of the clips between two signs of constriction strong
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	And then clip it together with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	This is the form of the circle which is here depicted, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the clipping with it is: that you may implement both the belly, or the bladder from the medicine, which is warmed according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance: and take care that it is not too hot or too cold, or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient is laid down on his back, and lifts his legs towards his chest: and put under it a cushion, that is, the skin over which men lie, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then bind the extremity of the clip with oil, or with alum, or with barley mucilage, or like these.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert the instrument itself into the hole with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then take hold of the belly with two hands and squeeze it, until it evacuates all that is in the clip into the intestine
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then extract the Clistere, and elevate the patient's limbs towards the side.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the physician considers him to be at the point of death, then let him support him as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	If he sleeps throughout the night, this is his last hope for recovery
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you administer the clistere in the bowels of the solution of the belly, and he shows signs of imminent death: then repeat the clistere until he is cured.</start_of_turn>
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the year, then let the clistere be gentle and soft, from the clisters which are given to children.</start_of_turn
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of the gentle clistere which is over that which is strict of the skin.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	Of the treatment of wounds of the head without fracture of the bone.</start_of_turn>
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head wound.</start_of_turn
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the discussion of the treatment of wounds which agrees with the book, and I will now speak of the treatment of these with the hand and with the help of physicians according to the complement.</start_of_turn
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore, that wounds are varied according to the cause of the wound and according to the place where the wound falls.</start_of_turn
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The wounds which are caused by many things are like the blows of a stone: or the cutting of a sword or knife: or the percussion with a lance or stick or arrow: and the like.</start_of_turn
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds which are caused by the place of the body are like a wound which falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or an arm: and the like of these from all parts of the body.</start_of_turn
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	I am now going to narrate the treatment of certain wounds, so that I can set forth the ratiocination and rule concerning the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	I shall begin with simple head wounds: for the memory of compound wounds will arise at the beginning of the third chapter
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: then consider, if it is from a stone or something similar, and if only the skin is split: then it is a large wound, and the time of healing is long for a wound of such severity: therefore do this: make an immediate cephalic bleed (phlebotomy): do not delay this; and extract from him from the blood according to the quantity of his virtue: if there is nothing to prevent it, especially if there is little blood flowing from the wound
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the side opposite the wound
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient be careful from repletion, from wine, and from coarse food
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If anything hinders the reduction (of the wound), then let him abstain from food, and not approach meat or drink wine
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And apply upon the wound if it happens that there is a blood clot, a soft compress of saffron only, or with wine in which there is stypticity.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	And if you are secure from the blood clot, then place over the wound, if there is still some blood in it, and it has not become black, the powder which I shall tell you of later: and if it has become black, then place over it some unguent, until it is healed
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	And if the wound is large, or is from a wound with a knife, or similar: and the edges do not adhere by themselves with little stitches, then unite them with sutures, according to what I shall narrate concerning the sutures of the internal wounds
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If, however, a vein has been detected by the bone, and hangs loose, and its retention is not possible, except in a small suspending apparatus: then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Care for the vein with the physicians, and restore it in the place of the skin, and command the patient to eat nourishing foods, such as heads and cooked wheat, until the pulse returns: and let them be similar.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find in the flesh putrefaction, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the putrefied part throughout, and throw it away: then care for the wound
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, in his wounds there is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by the physicians, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If, therefore, you find it untied, cut it off with Spatumili, or ligate it.</start_of_turn>
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity compels you when it does not conform to what we have said, then cauterize it, until the blood is severed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If, however, these wounds are small and simple, then the matter is easy and light: thus as to make powder of them over this powder: because it consolidates them before they change them by air.</start_of_turn
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The manner of making powder of the flesh.</start_of_turn>
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Olive oil one part, dragon's blood two parts, and unslaked lime three parts: mix them all together thoroughly, and grind them: and make from this a paste, and bind it with good constriction, until it adheres well to itself, and coagulates with the blood.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it up with sponges, and send it away, and do not wash it until it remains, so that it does not putrefy.</start_of_turn
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	Until it is healed, it is not eradicated by medicine from that.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that.
Caput LXXXV.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Until it is healed, medicine does not eradicate it from that
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the ulcer is deep, or it breaks into that sinus in its lower part, where pus is collected, then perforate it in a depressed place in that.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If an artery is cut in the ulcer, and its blood flow is consequent: then separate it, or dry it up, and ligate it: or cauterize it, if need be for that.</start_of_turn>
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, the cartilage of the gullet is broken in its entirety, and the fragments are close together: then gather the edges of the skin with a suture over the neck of the gullet, and do not touch the gullet, but rather equalize it, and reduce it to its natural shape.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it firmly with a dressing, and discharge it in a few days.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with poultices which have astringency and drying qualities, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, the ulcer has made an imprint in the bone, then inquire about it: then if there are fragments of bone in that, extract them all, or whatever can be extracted from it: and what cannot be prepared, discharge it, until the ulcer has healed, and the opening has closed.</start_of_turn
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the ulcer has been scraped, then powder over it the powder which I mentioned before.</start_of_turn
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, bone is seen in the ulcer, and a fistula has formed: then care for it as is mentioned in its chapter.</start_of_turn
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	(The provided text does not include the section title for this section of the manuscript.)
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.</start_of_turn>
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a percussion of a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider it.</start_of_turn
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If any blood proceeds from a wound when the patient desires to draw it out, then you know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is accompanied by its own blood: then you do not cauterize it in the first hour, neither do you ligate it, lest the blood be retained in its depth, and thereby cause the patient's death: but apply in it a strong dressing, and evacuate it in two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If indeed no dressing is present in the wound: then apply in the mouth of the wound a thick wool cushion, that it may absorb what proceeds from it from the humilities: and cause the patient to sleep over the wound, that the blood which collects in it may be cured
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed more than three days or more have passed from the wound and the patient has neither spasm nor bad tremor of the cord, neither bad congestion in the desire to urinate, and maintains all the other conditions: then you know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Treat it therefore with care and with medicines, and with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing is excused, and it always opens: then you know that a fistula has been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Treat it therefore from its head to its tail
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it as if it were large: or with powder if it is small
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has made an imprint in the bone, and has burst from it: then inquire about the wound, and proceed to extract the fragment, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated: then leave them alone, until the wound putrefies, so that the extraction of them may be easier.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment concerning the remaining wounds on the other limbs is that of the physician.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning the wounds of the belly, the intestines, and their exits
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs within the belly is great, medium, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great comes the evacuation of the intestines, or a number of intestines
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore the introduction of the bowels, and their suture, is more difficult and demanding
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small disruption is also difficult in another way
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that the reduction of these is more difficult if you do not immediately perform the introduction into its place: for it swells, opens, and becomes thickened: which makes its entrance difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason, the medium disruption is better: because with it the reduction of the intestines is not difficult, as it is with the small or great disruptions
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of the bowels is done in four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures are common in the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the rest of the limbs: and two other sutures are done properly with the rest of the wounds
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, there are other proper methods when suturing the belly: and I shall narrate them all with their exposition and their declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say, because when a wound is small, and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it: then this is due to one of the two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said: or because there is inflation in the intestine due to the cold of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When it is thus, then it is necessary to heat it, so that you may immerse the sponge or wet bag in tepid water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with barley, pepper, and spicery, and embrace the intestines with these, until the swelling subsides.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When it has made the liquid in which there is stickiness: it is better than plain water in resolving the swelling
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When the swelling has been resolved, then moisten the intestines with the water in which it has been boiled, or with vinegar.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For in this way it will soothe its entrance with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however it escapes after this treatment, then you will find it in slight disruption, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut off
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	The first treatment is better when it is prepared, than when it is forced, and does not cause a pressing of the cutting instrument beyond what is necessary and the defect of the instrument itself
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part be acute and the other not acute, and the outer part should not be like that of Spatumilis, but rather be somewhat blunt: and this is like a chick's foot, as regards the liquid
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the vessel has been strengthened and the intestine has been introduced, then it is necessary to reduce it according to its natural form in its own place, if possible over that: for this is better
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the rupture is wide at the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary to make the sick man lie on his back, and place his knees higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his feet
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	If there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then set your intention and consideration on this, that the part which has the wound be above the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary, that you should look at these things in great wounds and in medium wounds
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, set it according to what is prepared for you
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it present between your hands, your pious assistant who will hold the whole disruption of the hand: and gather its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then take from it whatever follows the suture something after something: and this is the method of common suture of one
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take the needle, or the number of needles according to the quantity of the wound
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then send from the extremity of the disruption the quantity of the little finger, that is, the physician: and fix the needle once having passed it into the flesh in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of fat which is under the skin, until you make it penetrate from another part, and you have gathered together the two extremities of the skin, and the two extremities of fat: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then string with a double thread around the circumference of the needle several times from two parts together, until two lips of the wound are gathered together with a decent aggregation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then send away the length of the little finger also, and fix in the flesh another needle: afterwards draw back the seam with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease doing this until you have completed the constriction of the whole wound
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And the needles are medium between the length and the thickness: because the fine needles slip easily through the flesh: and the thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: because of this it is necessary that they be medium in thickness, and long.<start-of-turn>
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	Neither should the needle be left protruding at two distant points of the skin near each other: for thereby the flesh will be more likely to split or tear before consolidation has taken place, and will even remain elongated even after stitching, thereby hindering consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Neither should the needle be left protruding at two distant points of the skin near each other: for thereby the flesh will be more likely to split or tear before consolidation has taken place, and will even remain elongated even after stitching, thereby hindering consolidation.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And thus is the kind of suture which is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For in stitching, one or two needles, or somewhat more, will suffice.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second common kind of suture is that in which the four extremities are held together by two stitches: two of the skin and two of the fat with the needle in which the thread is wound being of equal thickness and size
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	And when you have penetrated with the needle through the four extremities, reduce the needle from the part from which you began, so that the wound may be held by the remaining thread: as is the case with the stitching of cloth by which cloth is bound, and put between every suture as much of the thickness of a little finger
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of suture is well known to men
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And when I performed this suture on a wound which had been caused by a knife in its belly, which was ruptured through and through from the palm of the hand, and had burst out from the intestines almost two palms from the middle of the intestine, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I reduced the wound accordingly after I had set the intestines outside the wound for twenty-four hours
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The limb has been consolidated for about fifteen days and has healed: I have treated it and it is now cured. It has remained sound ever since, and has returned to its normal condition.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	The physicians declared that it would not recover.</start_of_turn>
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And miraculously, I cured it without medication.</start_of_turn>
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Since I was in a place where unguent was not to be found, and there was no doctor there.</start_of_turn>
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I put on the limb a warm compress twice a day, and I bathed it diligently with sweet water until it healed.</start_of_turn>
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I used two kinds of stitches as described in the sermon.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is necessary to start with a fine suture: and you insert the point from the outside to the inside of the part.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle has penetrated the skin, and has passed through the tough part of the wound according to the length and breadth of the entire body: withdraw the point which you inserted at the beginning in the side where you introduced the needle, and make the needle pass through from the inside to the outside of the opposite side at the other end.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made the needle pass through, then make it pass again in the same place from the outside to the inside: and withdraw the point which is in this side, and make the needle pass through the opposite side from the inside to the outside: and make the needle pass through with the same direction as you made it penetrate in the point which is in the part, until it penetrates the whole thing.</start_of_turn
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	And then start from this side also, and join it with the opposite side, and withdraw the needle from the skin where it penetrated.</start_of_turn
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce the skin to that same area, and scrape off the outer extremity which is on the other side, along with the inner one: and extract from the skin that which is from its part, and make it one with the other, and the other with the first: and make the latter one like the former, until the outer surface is complete according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	The sum of all these sutures is that of the skin-stitches which are to be made for the skin: so that the scraped area may be made one with the remainder of the skin by means of the sutures which are to be made from the outer part of the extremity to the inner part, and from the inner part to the outer part, until the surface is complete.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of proper suture which Gale has mentioned.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is how it is said that they should be made like the things which some physicians do, in order that every part may be gathered according to its kind: and that you should scrape off one extremity against the other, and the inner against the outer.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done according to what I have told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	The liver should be placed against the inner side of the outer extremity, and the skin should be pierced through from the outside inwards in that place: and extract the two extremities.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then draw out the liver, and make the skin penetrate from the outside inwards through two extremities of the scraped area, namely both of them.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then draw out both of them, and also make them penetrate from the inside outwards through the two outer extremities which are on the opposite side
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	This is the best way of stitching, and is the suture which requires the greatest memory
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is indeed what Galen has said.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some have said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture within is corrected with two squares.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	When the suture is within, two squares are added. That is, you pass through the tissue with one thread: and begin with the needle that is towards you, and make it penetrate until it reaches the other side, following the direction of the suture which joins the tissues equally
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly: then the suture of that is more difficult than the rest of the belly
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the ulcer of the wound is the judgment of the rest of the wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	When you follow the wound along with its blood, before it changes itself: and you reduce the intestine, and bring it close, and fix it: then you put on powdered ochre over the wound
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	When the air has already changed the wound: then you put on over it some unguents which are present, until they make pus: and the threads fall out, and they are consolidated, and it is healed
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	And then care for it as for the healing of the rest of the wounds, until it is healed
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if there are no remedies at hand, then you put on over it immediately, from which point it begins to discharge pus, slightly fat: and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not apply another remedy in many situations when the wounds are simple
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however you fear that the wound communicates with the principal parts of the body in the lesion: then it is necessary that you immerse fine wool yarn in lukewarm water, or in rose water: and put it around the parts which are between the groin and the armpits
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or swelling, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens to him), then he must anoint himself with vinegar of wine, black and warm: especially if the putrefaction has already penetrated the intestine, and an opening has been made through to its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know this, that which is from the great intestine is easier to heal: and that which is from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called the jejunum, does not endure healing from the wound that has happened to it throughout: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the greatness of their number, and because of the subtility of its body, and for its nearness to its own nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is pus, and you follow it, then reduce it according to your reduction which you make of the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, it has passed beyond that space, and has become black or dark: then it is necessary to string it with thread above the place which has become defiled, in order that the blood does not flow out from it.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the pus there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut through that which is beyond that ligament, and place two hanging threads from the lower part of the wound outside of it: in order to support over that which attracts it, and to extract it from the case of the pus, and to emit the pus of the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remember the wound that happened in the Intestine
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When disruption happens in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible, in some people, that it may be healed: because I saw that which was wounded in the middle of the stomach by the blow of a lance, and the wound was ancient: and a fistula was made, and it went out from it egestion, and swelling.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I remain in attendance until he is cured, for I am not relieved until his health has recovered completely: neither do I cease until he is fully healed and his position is firm.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	Once I have settled in his place, I fear over the patient, lest something bad should happen to him: and nothing bad has happened to him from that which might have happened to him.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	I remain in better positions, eating and drinking, trusting and having hope, and I bathed him and exercised him in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some of the experimenters say, when there is a wound in the intestines and it is slight: then it must be bound in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is like taking large ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then join together two lips of the wound, and put an ant on one of those which have an open jaw above two lips of the wound
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When the head is over them, and it binds its jaw, cuts off its head, and it will adhere to it, and will not break
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then put another ant close to the first, and do not cease doing this until the wound is complete
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	These heads remain annexed to the intestines until the intestines are fed and healed, and do not cause pain to the patient
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is possible to bind the intestines even with a fine thread: which has been taken from the intestines of an animal, and is annexed to it when it is introduced into the belly
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And take the extremity of this thread from the intestines, and remove a great deal of it.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then the ligament at its extremity is wrapped with a fine thread.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce the thread into the knot, and pass it through with the gut
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then tighten the knot.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And thus is the manner of stitching with needles and gut, except for some cases of great confidence and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that a large, wide vessel, especially if it is within a graceful gut: in such a case there is no skill except meticulous suture, and no healing is possible
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	With regard to care of wounds and fistula.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound, or fistula when it has become old and hardened, and has become a ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus constantly, and does not heal: in such a case it is called universally in every part of the body a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.</start_of_turn>
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is indeed according to truth a filtered node, hard, white: which does not cause pain, which has the consistency of a feather of a bird: and for this reason they call some of them Risati, that is, feathers.</start_of_turn
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And sometimes in certain hours it is wet, which emits pus.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And sometimes the wetness may split in certain hours.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes there is much of this wetness, and little: and it is large, and is soft.</start_of_turn
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And as I have said previously in the discourse, when I said that every ulcer which does not heal, and which is not born in this flesh, is not because of one cause.</start_of_turn
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	When one is in a state of scarcity of blood in the body: or because of the malice of the blood itself: or because of the hardness of the flesh between the labia, which hinders the birth of flesh: or because of the abundance of pus and phlegm: or because the ulcer in itself is putrid, and the matter which discharges from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment: or because corruption is falling in the region, and is a kind of pestilence: or by reason of property in the region, as for example in Caesaraugusta, in which there is great difficulty of digestion for ailment, and the healing of wounds is delayed by nature: or because in it is one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	I have also mentioned all these causes and signs, and the treatments for them with physicians. It is necessary that you write here the treatment for fistula and swelling, which is done by one operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You know therefore that fistula can occur in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	There are fistulas which extend to large veins and arteries, or nerves, or fat: or to the intestine, or the bladder, or to some of the bones: or to some of the vertebrae or to some of the compound joints: such as the hand, and the foot. And there are those which arise from proximity to the main limb and its parts of the same kind
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	For this reason, the fistulas are of this kind because of the difficulty of healing the ailment, and do not receive treatment, and are accompanied by labor and ignorance
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If, however, any fistula does not reach this depth, and you hope and trust in the treatment of it, and wish to reach cognition of it, then attempt to drain it from the air, or from iron, if the fistula follows a straight course, and inquire about it with her/him.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is a twist in the fistula, then you should investigate it with a fine lead weight.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Since lead is flexible with its body, it will curve around the twist
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If there are many openings in the fistula, it is not possible to perform an investigation with a weight on a hook.</start_of_turn>
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Explore the cavity from each opening through its own opening.</start_of_turn>
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For moisture which you apply to explore will spread out over other openings and will run out of the cavity.</start_of_turn
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire carefully in what way is it possible: whether it is a bone or a nerve, and whether the fistula is long or short: or whether it is a single fistula with many openings, and that lies throughout the whole, with the sum of your strength: with your questioning of the patient, and the finding of pain in compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and symptoms accompanying the accident.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have stood in all these positions truly, then you can proceed to the treatment with confidence: and it is that you consider whether the fistula is clearly adjacent or in a remote place from the junction, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of those places which I mentioned to you: then dry the fistula according to what has been said above, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupt tissues, which arise in its orifice from the flesh, or pus, and similar things: and treat it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, the fistula is of great depth and is according to the rule: then it is necessary to dissect it as deeply as possible.</start_of_turn
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then expose the whole of its corrupt tissues.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer the ligature tightly in acute cases: and introduce it until you have grasped the fistula with the iron: do this repeatedly until the acute medicine has eaten away all that remains in the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with the sutures which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If, however, it does not heal by this, then cauterize it as we have said.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If, however, the cause of the fistula is bone, and you suspect this to be the case: then inquire about it, and dry it as I have said: if this does not suffice, or if there is any other limb, vein, or main artery which is opposed to this, as we have mentioned.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If, however, it is detected that there is bone in it, and there is some corruption and blackness: then burn it until the corruption of it is completely consumed
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which nourishes it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	That if it does not heal, and pus comes out as before: then you know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Observe it carefully afterwards, and make reason for it, and treat it with the utmost care and skill
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If, however, it heals, that is good: and if not, you know that the corruption is in a profound depth of the body, which you were not able to overcome
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is not in this way that you will overcome it, except by resorting to the natural order of things.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the small bone is corrupted, and you are able to do so, draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for this purpose.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If many bones are present, then take care to make an attraction of them all, and do not send anything away from the bones with your force.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, there is any moisture in the incision, and there is no fear of error, then cut through the moisture and the flesh there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you are not prepared to extract the bones from their place at this hour, then put upon them something which will cause them to putrefy: and send them away, until they putrefy, that is, until the bones are freed from the flesh and moisture surrounding them
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And keep the bandage so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the incision be firm as you made it in your operation
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	And if you put upon it, if necessary, a bandage soaked in sulfur trioxide with oil: or a bandage soaked in Egyptian unguent, or any other unguents of your desire.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when the moisture putrefies, and separates from the bones, it alleviates the loosening of the bones, and their attraction
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If there is a large single bone, such as a thigh bone or a hip bone, and the like of them, which is corrupted, it is a great part: then take away that part last, until that black spot and corruption is removed from it.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the bandage.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If, however, that which is corrupted is a great part, and the corruption has already proceeded to the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut through it and open it right up to the place where the corruption remains: then cure it, until it is consolidated
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you this, which happened to me in my thigh: that you may take this as an example and aid in your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	A youth of about thirty years of age suffered pain in his leg, because something had become displaced from above downwards within the body, that is, from the interior, until it reached the leg, and there was great swelling: and there was no external cause of the matter.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	The swelling had continued for a long time, with the error of the physicians, until the swelling was opened up, and many materials came out together with it
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after this the healing was delayed, until the leg was bandaged, and many holes were made in it: from which pus and moisture of the body issued out
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	The matter was treated by many physicians for two years, and there was no skill in their art to be found in this matter, until I was called, and I applied a remedy to the leg, and the matters which were running out of the holes greatly decreased: even all the swelling of the body disappeared, and its colour became pale yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	There was an introduction of the hand into one of the holes, and the hand went up to the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	And then I examined all the holes, and I found that they were all connected with each other throughout the whole leg
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I then treated it, and I applied a dressing over one of the holes, until I discovered a piece of bone: and I found that it was corrupted: for it was rotten, discoloured, and putrified, and perforated, until it had penetrated right up to the marrow
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I saw that which had been detected was prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I concluded that there was no soundness in the bone except for that corruption which I had cut off and bound up
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I extirpated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I order restoration of the wound with the consolidated physicians in a spacious area.
Et non est consolidatum.	It is not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I attempted, and I found upon the second examination above the first: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I observed that there appeared to me also from that corruption
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	I attempted to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	It is not restored
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I found therefore upon it again, and I did not cease to cut the bone piecemeal, and to try to restore it: and it is not restored, until I cut from the bone round about one palm, and I extracted that with the marrow
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with the physicians, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and no further operation was necessary for this operation, and the section of the same, except for the disposition of the weakness of the patient, and his little tolerance, and my fear of death for him: because it was happening to him in every hour from the excessive evacuation of syncope.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was healed completely: and was born in the place of the hard bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he convalesced in his own dispositions: and did not make him contradict in walking at all
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the prominent bone in the body is fractured: then it is necessary to bind it up according to this method: that you take the ligament, and bind the bone at the extremity of the prominent bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and put another ligament from a thick thread beside the first ligament.</start_of_turn>
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the ligament over the flesh, which is on the bone: and extend the extremity of it, so that you draw the flesh downwards: and you detect the flesh over the place where you wish to cut, so that it does not injure the flesh.</start_of_turn>
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a board under the lower bone in the center: for when you do this, it will not hinder that it will secrete the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	The wound should be closed above the corrupted area without tension, so that there is no deformation of the bone's corruption: and it must not be visible in its appearance to the sense, and must incite to closure of its wound in another way.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and is not prominent, continue the part of it with the part: and the corruption is in the middle of it or in the part itself: then remove the flesh from all parts of it whole
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood under it
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then secure the wound from the first part where the corruption is, until the closure is completed from the other side: and let the wound be as far from the corruption as possible, as we said before.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is at the junction, cut through the corrupted junction, and secure the bone where the closure is completed on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two junctions, then there is no wisdom in it except to burn it.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the palm of the foot: then the matter is difficult to handle
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is true that you must inquire about the nature of the corruption.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And burn it, and cleanse it as you can in any way possible, and with any ingenuity: when it does not make opposition to the Vein or Nerve
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	You know that the forceps and scissors for cutting this bone are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and the size of them, and their fineness, and the magnitude, and the number of them, and their rarity
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Wherever necessary, one must prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	Know that these operations are significant to you above the kind of instrument that you do not know well.</start_of_turn>
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of healing: for then you will find for yourself what is suitable for all diseases from the instruments.</start_of_turn>
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	I am firm in the end of this chapter concerning the number of instruments, which I have set as examples for which you inquire, and the proof that you will experience with others.</start_of_turn>
Forma Serrae.	Form of the Saw.</start_of_turn>
Forma alterius Serrae.	Form of the other Saw.</start_of_turn
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of the third Saw.</start_of_turn>
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of the fourth Saw.</start_of_turn
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of Saw is cut in the middle.</start_of_turn
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its arc be superior, its point from the iron: and its handle from the box, and let it be pyramidally cut in the middle.</start_of_turn
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Form of the Scissors for joining.</start_of_turn
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this Scissors be according to the form of the head of the star-shaped key: and its points according to the form of the holes of the elish.</start_of_turn
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not fit, except when it is scraped with that head of the joining, when the bone is broken, or the limb is wide, and great.</start_of_turn
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Form of the greater Scissors.</start_of_turn
Forma medii Rasorii.	Form of the medium Scissors.</start_of_turn

Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Form of Rasassa small, soft of tension.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Form of Rasassa with which bones are joined together
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Form also of Rasassa large
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is like Radio, and the extremity is as a Saw: it appears in many places because of the reason of bones
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Form of Rasassa which agrees with the reason of that which is perforated by bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremity is triangular, and the extremity of it is acute
Fit ex Indi.	It is from India
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And it is like this concerning all that we have said of Rasassa, and Incisor, and Saw
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Concerning the incision of extremities, and the suture of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Extremities become putrefied, either by an external cause, or an internal one
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated the disease with medical care, and the cure has not been effected: and when the disease has progressed to such an extent that it does not yield to treatment: then it is necessary to cut off that limb up to the point where the disease has ceased to progress, so that the patient does not succumb to the disease, or from the consequence of the defect of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of that is that the limb is blackened, until it is burnt: that fire has consumed it, or it has become putrid after it has become black: until that putrefaction has spread throughout the body
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Properly therefore with the incision itself, and in like manner if the cause of the corruption is percussion of some venomous creatures: such as the scorpion of the sea, and spiders, and fleas, and their kin.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore corruption exists, or percussion at the extremity of the digit, then incise the digit, and not leave space for the corruption, so that it may reach to the remainder of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And in like manner if it happens in the palm of the hand, then incise from the root of the bone, and not leave space for the corruption, until it has reached the bone of the forearm
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it comes to the bone, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption passes around the elbow: then in that is the mark of the infirmity.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer besides this from the cure, is the quantity of ointment.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And in like manner do concerning the foot, when the corruption comes to the digit, then incise it at one of the nodes: and if it comes to the heel, then incise the whole foot
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it reaches the knee, then incise the thigh at the knee joint
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	What if the corruption has already passed above the knee? Then it is not in that it is impotent, except for dismissal, and leaving the infirmity to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the manner of incising the limb, or preserving it, is that you tie the ligaments below, which you wish to cut: and tie the ligament above in the place of the cut
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And extend one minister of the ligament downwards: and extend the other minister of the ligament upwards
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh is detached
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it happens, or it returns.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	Then it happens, or it returns. It is necessary to draw from all parts of the wound line, and not to touch the healthy area: and the wound will be added to the infirmity, and the swelling will become cold.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If blood flows inwards during the operation, then cauterize the place quickly: or put over it some powder which will absorb the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medicine until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind up the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and care for it until it heals
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened in the foot, behold that this is what happens which I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	Because it happened in his foot black, with a burning which assimilates with the heat of the fire: and the corruption happened first in his finger, until the whole foot was affected
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	He therefore escaped from his misfortune, after he had cut off the corruption from the limb with his knife, because of the pain, and the burning: and it happened at the joint, and he was healed
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption happened in the thumb of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I attempted to recover the superfluousness with what I found on the hand from the doctors after the restoration of his body: and the superfluousness was not recovered, and it began to spread to another finger: until the corruption reached the hand itself
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to cut off his hand: and I did not do it, hoping for the return of the superfluousness: and I was also afraid of the death of his hand at the incision
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Since the man was very strong over the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he had departed from me in despair, he returned to his land: and he came to me because he was anxious, and he grasped my hand completely: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And do not believe this story, except that it be of service concerning this which has fallen from the kind of this disease: and that it be indicative of what is signified, and according to how it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Of the care of limbs, and the quality of blistering with the physicians.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When swelling occurs in some limb with pain, and the extent of the swelling is prolonged until collection of pus has taken place: then it is broken open, or pierced, and the pus which is in it is ejected, and the place which was filled with pus is left like a cavity: and the skin which is above it is like a thin veil which has been stripped off: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, neither does it affect the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it is called a sinus and not a fistula, although if its extent is prolonged, until corruption affects some parts of the limb, then it is called a fistula or swelling
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its care is that you cut through the whole skin as if you were rolling it: and especially when it is thin, and made like a veil: and trust that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and that there is no ultimate consequence from this: and if there is thickness in the skin from the flesh, then cure it with blistering: and consider it as a sinus
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus which comes out of it is foetid in odour: then blister it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and alum, in equal parts, gathered up in fat: and boil them over a fire, until the medicine boils: and apply it to the swelling with honey
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from that which you need: dissolve it with water and honey, and instill it with that Sinum: and clamp its orifice, and send the medicine into it for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then draw it out with expression: do this for several days until the sinus is healed, and the odor is gone.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is instilled with aqua cineris, when it is not present this medicine: then take cineres of wood or cineres of ilex leaves: and sprinkle them on water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then close the wound, and instill it with that, until you are confident that the sinus has been closed
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, neither aqua cineris, then instill it with water and honey, to which something of pounded ginger has been added
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or instill it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey to heal and soften, and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is excess of styptic and drying matter in the wine
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this often, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has passed away: then instill it with that which makes new flesh in it
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is good to take from dyafinicon ointment: and dissolve it with rose water and wine vinegar: or instill it with some medicine, and oil of other things whose properties are written in the treatise on unguents.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the orifice of the sinus is narrow, in which the cannula for instillation will not pass: then enlarge it with a small piece of iron: or place in the opening a pledget of lint soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	Likewise, if the opening is large, then gather its lips together with sutures: and discharge from it the quantity which enters the abscess without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	Likewise, if pus runs from the opening, it is raised upwards: then dry it in the lower place which is in it, so that it runs from it downwards: for pus, when congealed in depth, hinders the generation of flesh in it
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	For if it is not possible to dry the sinus downwards, then try to prepare the limb by preparing it in such a way that it runs from it the pus with ease as is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try that nothing of the pus remains in it: and take solidifying medicines which are placed over the mark, suitable for that which you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend the ease over the edge of the skin.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the skin be of such quantity as to make communication of the whole sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors directly at the opening of the sinus, widening the opening of the sinus more
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then stretch out from the strings of intestines over the other skin, according to the quantity of the hole: and put it over itself in a long position from the opening of the sinus, so as to alleviate the escape of pus from it: and do not tighten the skin too much, except after a few days once it has healed somewhat.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	He who is over the opening of the sinus must move in every hour, so that it may go out what is gathered in it from the pus: and you shall know whether it runs out much or little: or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you have done this again, consider the place of the sinus itself, whether the master of it feels pain there, or whether there is no pain there, or whether there is swelling there, or whether there is no swelling there.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When the medication has been administered as directed, and you see that the material issuing from the Sinus opening has ceased, then you know that the Sinus is adhered, or is close to adhesion: then you must remove it by hand, or on the third day. And when you have removed the clot, then exchange the bandage and renew the dressing.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If, however, it continues to issue from the Sinus after a long space of time with a slight flow, then you must not despair of adhesion, for healing approaches, because there are people who are slow to form flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrariwise to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If, however, it continues to issue from the Sinus after many days with undigested pus, then you know that the Sinus is not adhered
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If, therefore, the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed and its condition persists: then add in the treatment the moisture of medicines, truly make the physicians perform this, that there be moisture in the substance and dryness in the air: like unguentum dyafinicon, when added to this there is an excess of moisture
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last thing which is to be cured, that is, to take unguentum dyafinicon and mix it with rose water, and apply it over the old liquid equal in quantity to the substance itself
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then keep it with it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does the same thing as this action, when there is no unguentum dyafinicon present, honey, when you boil it, until it is reduced, and you use it with this.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, aloes, and olibanum: all of these together, and grind it up on honey when it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then smear over the bandage, and bind it over the Sinus: and smear with the honey which you boiled until it was reduced: and grind over it the spices, and put over the bandage, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when administered in that place, long aristolochia, and roots of celestial lily, and is lily: and seed of herb, and centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	And use either singly or compounded with these, and powder of that which I have mentioned, and use that also.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If it prolong the condition of the sinus and does not recover with this treatment: then you know that in its depth there is corruption: or that it makes an imprint in bones, or in other hard members or ligaments: then cure the fistula itself, according to what has been said before
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the treatment of panaritis and drawn nails, and incision of the added digit, and section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XC-I.</start_of_turn>
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritis is a swelling which arises under the nail of the thumb or finger, and perhaps in the other digits.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When it prolongs the condition of that, and is neglected, and swells with heat: or it becomes corrupted and emits pus, until it corrupts the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole thing, and perhaps the corruption extends to the bone, and there is a foul odor: and the digit becomes wide at the end, and its color becomes dark
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you have cured it with what we said before, and the condition does not recover: then it is necessary to cut off the entire superfluity that remains from the nail with a knife
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the nail afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	The cautery is to be made hot
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the addition of the nail has already penetrated the flesh and begins to pierce it, and causes pain: then it is necessary to place a small radium under the angle of the nail which is piercing the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut the flesh with ease, and place over that which remains of the flesh from the physicians who have burned and corroded it until it is removed entirely
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, corruption has already set in the bone, then it is necessary to cut off the bone and extract it: for it will not heal as long as corruption remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If the swelling and corruption spread to a limb, then cut it at one joint, as has been mentioned previously concerning its sensation
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, there is attrition or percussion of the nail, and there is pain in it: then it is necessary to bleed the diseased part at first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp knife, cutting across from above to below to the tip
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful that the cutting does not reach the flesh under the nail, for this will cause additional pain and swelling in that place
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with that which rests pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger which has been added which is born in the hands of men, perhaps is altogether fleshy: perhaps there is something in some of its bones, perhaps in that there is the nail: and some of them are born in the root of the joint, or that is the origin of their nature in some part of the limb.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	He who is born in some part of the limb does not move: and he who is born at the junction of the limb, perhaps moves
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	He who is born of flesh is easily cut through
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	As you would cut it at the root with a broad knife
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	As for him whose origin is in the root of the joint, the treatment is difficult
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Abstain therefore from incision of it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	Abstain therefore from incision of it.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Caput XCII.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Abstain therefore from incision of it
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the limb of the sick from the upper part of the thigh down to the lower part of the knee with an outturn.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then draw up the limb in one place, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then elevate, that is, draw out the blood from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and from the top let the blood flow down as phlebotomies for the sick in the first place.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then bind the limb until below: until the blood which you drew out has gone out from the limb in an amount sufficient, and as much as the sickness can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind the limb again: and command him to abstain from foods which generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and it will benefit the sick man
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of it is, however, done in this way.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	The limb of the sick person, if there are many hairs in it
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse the limb in a bath: or embroider the limb in the knee with warm water, until it turns red, and the veins swell: or perform an exercise of force, if there is no bath for him, until the limb is warmed up
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then bind the skin along the vein section: or at the end of it at the knee, or at the lower part of it at the heel
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with needles, and scrape the vein from every side, until it appears sensible: and it is at the appearance of it that the blood will change from red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it has gone out of the skin, the blood will be like white thread
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then put under it radium, until when it is raised and comes out of the skin: suspend the limb with a bandage of lead wool
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry the other section close to that section by three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the wound until it appears
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift the tissue with forceps as you did before, and suspend it with another loop, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry the other section, or several sections, if necessary.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift up and divide the last section at the heel
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then remove the tissue up to the section that is above it
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	Do this until you have removed the tissue from the superior section, or from all the higher sections, until you have reached the end: then divide the tissue
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If, however, you are unable to remove and lift the tissue: then introduce a strong needle with a double thread, and ligate the tissue, and remove it: or introduce it under the tissue: and draw the hand back over the whole part until it has gone away
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And take care not to damage it
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is damaged, it is difficult to lift the tissue afterwards, and infection enters through that wound
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have therefore removed the whole tissue: then place over the wound a soaked wool pad in wine or rose oil, or oil: and care for it, until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having a twist to which the blood supply is obstructed, and is not as we have described in accordance with the rule: then you must find on the tissue over all the parts the twist of the vein itself, and the place of obstruction.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend the tissue with sutures, until you have lifted the whole tissue: and take care at the site of your incision over the tissue that you do not damage the vein, or wound: for it is difficult to lift or extract the tissue from there
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Beware therefore of your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	Take heed therefore of your prudence.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Beware therefore of your prudence.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Beware therefore of your prudence, for it is neither cowardly like the rest of men, nor acute at the extremities, as to wound the vein: but it is great in flexibility, gentle: for if it were slight, it would wound the vein by its own softness. And indeed it is superfluous to have great flexibility, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Concerning the extraction of the vein of the leg
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein originates in the legs in warm lands, like Alizegi and the Arabs, and in dry, warm lands, few in number, that is, in which no herb or tree grows
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it originates in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is also from the putrefaction which happens under the skin, as when serpents and worms are found inside the body, and worms which are generated between the skin and the flesh
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that inflammation occurs in the leg with swelling.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is to be dried up.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to come out of that place of drying up, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When it appears from that extremity, then it is necessary to cover over the lead with lead, whose weight is from a drachma to two drachmas and a node: and let the lead fall from the leg
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever anything is brought out from this towards the outside, let it be solidified in lead and bound.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it persists for a long time, then its part must be excised, and the remainder solidified.</start_of_turn>
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut through the root before the whole has gone out.</start_of_turn>
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut through it, it contracts and enters the flesh: and causes the swelling to increase, decay in the place, and a bad ulcer.</start_of_turn>
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to handle it gently and extract it slowly, until nothing remains of it in the body: and from this vein it goes out in some people as far as the tip of the thumb and the little finger.</start_of_turn
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And indeed it has come to me that it has come out from the urine of twenty palms.</start_of_turn>
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If, however, this occurs at the time of your medication: then introduce radium into the cavity of its wound, and pierce the wound through and through with the body, until all that is in it is evacuated: and administer treatment for the wound with physicians for a few days.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the swelling.</start_of_turn
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein often has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and there are many outlets for it, and it goes out through every outlet branch.</start_of_turn
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Care for it accordingly, as we have said before, and as is proper.</start_of_turn
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	About the cutting of the worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bovine Disease.</start_of_turn
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	Chapter XCIV.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it proceeds throughout the whole body, ascending and descending: and is perceptible to the sense during its walking from limb to limb, until it is ruptured at every place where it is ruptured in the skin in its place.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of some humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Like worms and serpents, that is, lice and worms in the belly
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they are fearful of its malice
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it itself proceeds into the body, and ascends to the head, and comes to rest in a place: then perhaps it will open in that place, and depart, and destroy the eye: and that is what often happens
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore one wishes to cure it and extract it, then it is not done except during its walking and the appearance of its sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore to string what is above it and what is under it with strong ligation
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it has gone deep into the flesh, and you do not find it: then put on the place above it a cautery with fire, until it dies
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater than that which is feared is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you find that it has come to rest near the eye in the head: then string under it over the eyebrow with good ligation.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and extract it
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person should take care of the purification of his body, with physicians resolving the bad humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the section above the navel.
Caput XCV.	Regarding the section above the navel
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	The pain located above the navel is called Nakir in our land: it is a pain that occurs in some parts of the body, and then changes from one part to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have seen it happen, as I will tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a woman who was sick in some village
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And I saw her arm swollen, and I found an inflammation of the vein of the arm
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw another swelling appear with a worm, which went up towards his shoulder more quickly than is possible: just as silver flies from one place to another
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain therefore departed from that place and settled in the shoulder
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	And after a while it went away throughout the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	And she told me that it returned to its whole body, as I saw it
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I am amazed at the speed of its change from one limb to another
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself had never seen such a pain before like this in the same way as this
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	But I have seen many people who have had pain changing from one limb to another: and I had never seen anything like that before in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	I do not believe this is possible, except that it is because of the women of those regions who are known for their swelling veins: from there therefore appears to be a change of sensation throughout the body.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	It is necessary that they do not appear according to this ratio in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, and in secret veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore the physician sees that the patient feels pain, and if it is evident to him that the ailment appears to the eye, as we have said, then he must bind over that part above and below quickly: and dry above that part until the swelling subsides: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If however you do not see it with your eyes: then care for it with the exclusion of the body, and with that which ejects the swellings, and calm it with poultices of rue, and of saffron, and the like.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	(The provided text does not include information regarding the extraction of Sagittarum, so I cannot translate that portion.)
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Sagittae are varied according to their kinds and the places from which they are extruded from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	And their variety is such: because some of them have large teeth and few: and some are concave and others are convex
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And there are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And those which have tongues
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And those which have stars
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	As for those which are according to the members from which they are extruded, it is according to two kinds
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Either the members are from the main bodies which are concave, such as the brain, and the heart, and the spleen, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and things of that kind
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any of these members, and a sign of death appears to you, which I will tell you afterwards, then it is necessary to extract that arrow from the body, for death follows the wound in many arrangements
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these signs do not appear, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then extract it, and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	When these signs do not appear, and the arrow has not penetrated the bone, then extract it and care for the wound.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood will flow from the nail or from the flesh.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps the flesh will be severed and the bone will be broken
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And from the wound will come out a white moisture like pus
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And from it will come out something like the moisture of meat
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If these signs appear, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow that has entered the cord are: that it is close to the left breast: and that it feels as though it is fixed in something hard, not in something soft
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow will move like the pulse: and blood will flow from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And following this will be cold extremity, and cold sweat, and fainting
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	You know therefore that death approaches with doubt
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	The sign of an arrow that has pierced the lung is the exit of bloody foam from the wound: and the breath that follows the head becomes thick and changes color like that of the sick person
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	He expires greatly and with difficulty: and he seeks the attraction of cold air
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the chest, that is near the ribs: then there is great pain with breathing, with sighing: and all the limbs of the arms move violently
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	If an arrow should fall into the stomach, it may possibly emerge from the wound through some undigested food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	If an arrow should fall into the belly and settle there: something of stool or vomit or intestine which has been ruptured will issue from the wound.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is no hope for its cure, neither in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow falls into the bladder and comes out with urine: and something proceeds from it outwards, and the pain is more severe: then you know that it is deadly
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	As for the rest of the members, such as the face, and the neck, and the gut, and the spatula, and the attendant, and the rib cage, and the backbone, and the shoulder, and the hip, and the thigh, and the like of these members, if they do not find the arrow in the artery or nerve: and if there is no venomous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	I tell you, concerning these arrows, that I have heard of none of them, except as a sign of your desperation concerning your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is because I have heard that an arrow once fell into the tear-duct of his eye, or in the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I extracted it from the other side, under the earwax of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm remained in his eye
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was hidden, and I did not find its tip until I had cut through its wood: and it was a large arrow, such as those which the Turks shoot with their bows, with lead in it, in which there are no ears
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	He was healed of this, and no harm befell him in his eye
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another sausage from the Christian's belly.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab sausage, which is like that which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	And so I went above and beyond two ribs: and it was submerged in his belly.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was careful with it and brought it out: and the Christian was healed
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another sausage which had burst inside him: and we thought that it would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After that, for thirty days, nothing changed in his condition concerning the sausage: and I saw that it had healed, and I extracted it: and he was healed, and nothing bad happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw the man from whom the sausage had burst in his back, and the wound was closed with a bandage over the sausage
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	And after seven years, the sausage was extracted from the root of his hip bone
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman whose sausage had burst inside her: and the wound was closed with a bandage over the sausage, and the sausage remained inside her: and no change occurred in her condition from her natural operations
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man whose sausage had burst on his face: and it was closed with a bandage, and it remained, without causing him much pain: and similar things happened to many people
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted a sausage from the belly of the King, which had burst in the middle of his nose, and it had declined to the right side: and the sausage was completely hidden
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called to care for him after the bursting of the sausage until three days later
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the arrow stuck quite tightly in the flesh.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I grasped it with a fine hook, and did not feel it: and indeed I found the point of the arrow and the pain from its side on the right hand
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I supposed that it was the point of the arrow at the extremity of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I plastered the place with a plaster which was moist and sticky, confident that the place would be relaxed, and that I would see the sign of the arrow, that is, that it would leave its mark above the wound: and this did not happen in the place where the arrow had followed the place of the wound.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I remained with the plaster on for many days: and it did not happen that anything occurred, and the arrow remained stuck in the meantime: and he remained sick from the extraction of it until he felt the arrow one day enter his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I put on him a sharp, corrosive medicine on that place for many days: until it opened: and when I grasped it with my hook, and I felt the extremity of the arrow slightly which adhered to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	And I added in the opening of the wound by that sharp medicine until we saw the extremity of the arrow clearly: and we passed it out with it in that space of time for about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	And when the wound had healed, and it was possible for me to introduce forceps into it, and to move it, and it did not obey the coming out: then I did not cease to grasp it with a fine hook, and to fashion above it with the wisdom of experienced men, until I was able to grasp the arrow with forceps at the end, and I drew it out
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the limb.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the physicians say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I restored it therefore itself, and the limb was consolidated, and the illness was healed completely: nothing was left of it
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell thee the quality of the extraction of some arrows: so that thou mayest know the rule and the signification of that which I have not said
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and the distinctions of them are not comprehended with the narration: neither doth this book comprehend them, and a prudent artificer compares them with little to much: and with that which is present, with that which is absent: and he finds a new operation and an new instrument among the descent of the things of this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that arrows do not go out of the limbs in which they are fixed, except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Either by attraction from the place from which it came in.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by turning back the other part
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which goes out from where it came in, or the arrow proceeding in the fleshy place: it is attracted and goes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not obey the going out at the hour in which it fell: then it is necessary that thou shouldest let it go a few days, until the flesh which is around it is putrefied: and the attraction of it and its going out will be removed
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And in the same way if it is caught in a bone, and it does not obey thee at the going out, then thou shouldest also let it go a few days: and repeat it every day with the attraction and the motion, until it goes out
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey thee at the going out after days, then it is necessary that thou shouldest perforate round about the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine thread, until the arrow be amplified
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw out the abscess, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in the head of a bone, and has proceeded into one of the ventricles of the brain, and appears from the sickly parts some of the accidents which I mentioned: then abstain from the drawing out of the arrow, and leave it, until it be equal to its former state after a day.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow remains in the brain, the poison does not prolong its duration.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of a bone, and does not penetrate as far as the brain: and remains sick for some days, and no accident happens to him from these things: then think of the drawing out of the arrow and its extraction.</start_of_turn>
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If however it is fixed firmly, and does not obey you in the drawing out: then apply a poultice round about the arrow, as I have told you before: then keep the place still, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however the arrow has vanished from its place in the body, and is hidden and concealed from sense: then inquire about it with care.</start_of_turn
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then draw it out with some instruments which are suitable for its drawing out.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If however you are unable to do so because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in its depth: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor blood vessel: then find above the wound until you can amplify the wound, and it be possible to extract the arrow.</start_of_turn
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	When there are ears which hold the flesh fixed in the bone from all sides, from every ingenuity which you can think of, and you think of freeing them, if you cannot make the evacuation of the flesh from the fracture of the ears, and the twisting of the ears, until it becomes easy.</start_of_turn
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	When you administer the extraction of the Sagitta, in whatever place it is, then use a twisting of your hand with the forceps to all parts, until you have made it go away: and under the last subtle degree, that it does not break the Sagitta, and that it becomes difficult for you to draw it out, and for the extraction itself.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you are unable to accomplish this in one hour, then delay the procedure for a few days, until the surrounding parts have decayed.</start_of_turn>
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: if indeed it opposes the flow of blood, then administer what we have mentioned in its chapter: and preserve your virtue from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or cord.</start_of_turn>
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer with all possible wisdom the evacuation of the Sagitta: and let this be with ease, and tranquility, or with slowness, and firmness, as I have said.</start_of_turn
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you do this when you draw out the Sagitta, that the patient is according to the figure, according to what was with the Sagitta itself in this case.</start_of_turn
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For thus is the art of healing.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If indeed this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the figure.</start_of_turn
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The Sagitta which comes out from the opposite side, or which proceeds from something to the exterior: or it makes a swelling of the extremity of the Sagitta by means of the sense from the superior part of the skin close by, and it brings up the swelling: dry therefore above the swelling, and make the incision according to the quantity that they grasp in the forceps.</start_of_turn
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw out the Sagitta: for itself is made easy to come out.</start_of_turn
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it remains in the bone, then twist your hand according to the circumference, until the arrow has been driven into the bone, and will thereby be increased: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	If not: leave it for a few days: then repeat the process until it has departed.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow-shaft is in it, then push it out with that itself.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however the bone has fractured, and you wish to apply a force: then introduce into the wound an instrument with a concave surface, so that its curvature may engage with the head of the arrow: then push out the arrow with the instrument itself.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow is concave, then push it out with the instrument entering through it
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The arrow will thereby be driven out through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to remove the entire piece of flesh in which the poison is contained: if this is possible
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of the wound as is appropriate to it
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow has fallen into the chest, or the belly, or the arm, or the side: and is close to that which you touch with your hand, and it is possible to dry over the wound: then dry, and burn away from the wound, the nerve or bone, and draw out the arrow.</start_of_turn>
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then keep the wound covered with a bandage, if necessary, and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	This is the manner of the forceps, by which arrows are drawn out.</start_of_turn>
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The extremities are like the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not relax it.</start_of_turn
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	There are many kinds of wounds, large, small, medium, according to the quantity of the size of the arrow, the density of its substance, the breadth of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The wound is of a concave shape.</start_of_turn>
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	The wound is of a blunt shape.</start_of_turn
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the shape of the extremities like a Radius, so as to facilitate the entrance of the arrow into the concave sagittam, and it is driven by it.</start_of_turn
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this wound is concave like the beak of a bird: so as to facilitate the entrance of the arrow into itself and the driving force of it.</start_of_turn

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of the three veins in the elbow
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	However, three veins are usually phlebotomized in the elbow
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by grasping with a large needle: or by lancing with an awl to the point of slight bleeding: or by cutting with a knife, which is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is when it agrees to the section
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	There are broad and narrow species according to the width of the veins and the tension of them. The form of phlebotomy with the large needle is broad, like oil
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	It is suitable for opening wide, full, protruding, apparent, large, and those containing thick blood
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	This phlebotomus is of smaller width and finer extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	It is suitable for the phlebotomy of fine veins which contain thin yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the phlebotomy of Albucasis.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	Basiliae, however, which is one of the three veins mentioned for phlebotomy, is an instrument.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the swellings which are under the jaw and the collar, from the part following the chest and the groin: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist because of its resemblance to the phlebotomus of the veins, so that it should not cause fear that there is an artery beneath it
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If, therefore, it err, and the puncture of the phlebotomy should happen, the artery will be injured, and the flow of blood will be interrupted
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary not to perform phlebotomy with the phlebotomus at the same time as the puncture: but rather let it dry with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If, however, Basilica does not appear visibly, then it is necessary to seek it elsewhere: either by means of other veins or by inquiry of another person; or to perform the phlebotomy in another place, such as the elbow vein
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is itself evident, and should be left dry with the Anesil, as we have already said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If, however, you wish to perform the phlebotomy on itself, then before you tighten the band around the limb, touch the place to recognize the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with a scar, afterwards the limb, and dry the vein with the concave section of the phlebotomus using the Anesil, as we have already said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And let the blow not fall outside the space of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you ligature, when you tie the string, the inflation in the place that you marked with the cautery, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: you must therefore do the thing.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	And if you see blood escaping at the phlebotomy, like the urine of a boy, and it is pale, red: then you know that it is from the artery
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then do you act promptly, and place your finger over that long space, and then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If blood is therefore shed (for it is often shed), then tighten the arm, and let go of it: and let the patient be still: and keep above fear of him.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move him for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if blood is not shed, and you are doubtful: and there is no physician present at your time, then cut the artery if you see it
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities are tense, and blood is shed.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of the skin of the buttock, and find it: take the middle third, and tighten it above the place of the constriction below, with string and threads until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is shed, that is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then care for him as one who remembers the location of the bleeding vessels: and the bleeding of the artery is not difficult in many positions, because of the smallness of the wound, and the possibility of tying the artery from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	¶ On phlebotomy of the forearm.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	Veins of the neck are the instruments of phlebotomy, as they draw blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because they are composed of the basilica branch and the cephalic branch, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	It is convenient for the phlebotomist that there be some distance above the site of phlebotomy, for under that is the nerve
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore any one adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds the nerve, there will result in that state of stupor, and the healing will be difficult, and perhaps will not take place at all
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve is supplied to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	And if in any one it is hidden, and is slight, and is not visible: then it is necessary to put in phlebotomy beyond the place where you phlebotomize, with Alnesil, and to divide the nerve with care
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is an instrument, as it draws blood from the head and supplies it to the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	It is necessary in this vein alone, if you will, to phlebotomize with the olive-leaf needle, or with the Myrtle needle: because it is safer for the veins of all, because there is neither artery nor nerve under it
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Indeed it is convenient to you in phlebotomy to ask for the soft parts [of the head] with the first blow, and to seek a softer place: and it does not harm if it is not found with the first blow, as it will return with subsequent phlebotomies.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Perhaps the swelling may disappear in some individuals when the percussion does not take place at the first attempt, but it does not harm them in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Regarding the use of phlebotomy and precautions to be taken in its performance.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy and the accidents associated with it, concerning which you must reflect
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, know that phlebotomy is not to be undertaken except for the preservation of health, and for the cessation of ailments, and for the prevention of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	It is to be performed in the cubital veins, that is the Cephalica, and the Fusca, and the Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	It should be performed in the spring after Lent, in the summer, and in the autumn, and in the winter after meals, when there are signs of fullness
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	It should be performed on the first or third day after the lapse of three hours
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Phlebotomy for diseases has no fixed time: but when it is necessary and convenient, day or night, at any hour and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	It should not be performed in children until they are more than fourteen years of age
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Neither should it be performed in a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh month
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor in an elderly person who has passed the age of sixty years
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When anyone wishes to undergo phlebotomy for whatever reason: it is necessary to administer a laxative before phlebotomy if there is much stool retained in the intestines: in order that they do not adhere to the main veins during phlebotomy, causing harm to the body
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Neither the patient's vomiting nor the nausea itself should be forced, neither by pressure nor from drunkenness, until the cause of the former has vanished from the body.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Neither with hydrophobia shall the patient be left
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let another bloodletting be performed after the colic passion, vomiting, diarrhea, frequent urination, sexual abstinence, rest, exercise, joy, and fasting, which dissolve strength from the body or the animal
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the sublimity of the humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drink, and with physicians: if it is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let a bath be introduced, if it does not forbid it: or let some exercise be performed, in order to temper the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And let a phlebotomy be made of him in the chest, about the third day: as we have said: and endeavor that he evacuate his chest from all these bad things: such as envy, wrath, fear: and from all bodily things, such as labor, suffering, and superabundance, and such like these.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And make his food be present with things which are customarily used by men from fragrance, and odor, and delight, and the like, as much as is possible
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit above the patient's heel, which is higher than the heel of the phlebotomist: then he shall extract his arm and wipe it with his hand twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then tie the ligament with a bandage, and wrap it twice around the limb twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the restraint be temperate, for when the restraint is unequal, or through excessive restraint, then it hinders the course of the blood: or in softening, then also it hinders the course of the blood
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the stricture has been passed, it is necessary that the phlebotomist should immediately seize both hands together and hold them close to the belly, until the veins have filled up and the sense has returned.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then let the phlebotomist take hold of the vein with a slight grasp, as before.</start_of_turn>
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he places his finger on the index finger of the left hand over the vein at the place where he wishes to make the phlebotomy, slightly: so that the vein does not slip away, and that the percussion is set.</start_of_turn
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For from the veins is more to be feared like a flying cord during phlebotomy: and from the blood that is filled with air: and when you place the phlebotomy on the vein, it contracts under the phlebotomy, and the phlebotomist is struck, and the vein is not opened by the phlebotomy: and if it is opened, it is a stricture: because of this, it is necessary that the phlebotomist should be firm and attentive in all these things.</start_of_turn
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he lets go of the phlebotomy.</start_of_turn
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If thus the vein opens from the blood, then it is good.</start_of_turn
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it with another vein nearby, or above that with force: if the place does not recover.</start_of_turn
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	And if it recovers, or if the patient becomes pale, then send him away on the first or second day, and do not tie the ligament.</start_of_turn>
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed the swelling will subside.</start_of_turn
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Neither must you put in a poultice.</start_of_turn
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.</start_of_turn
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or blood runs slowly: take care that it does not escape from the blood more than is necessary. Then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place according to custom, and add a little more to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	Do it with speed, before the place is closed. For the place is split in many people during the operation itself
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see that the matter is already closed, do not go over it again completely, for this may excuse you for anything.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place upon it some of the fat of oil: because it will soothe the running of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	It is better in this place than pure oil, and than any other oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And do the same with the fat of oil in all your phlebotomies, which you do on account of the running of the blood: and they will make it like tyriaca alfarach, and sage, when you place one of them upon the place
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	The blood will become thin and dissolve, when it is thick
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If therefore it happens in the place of the phlebotomy that there is a large opening, namely in many people who are not phlebotomized except for this wound, or because the opening is small of the vein, then be careful and place upon the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed up slightly: and bind it for an hour: because it will dissolve
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has escaped from the vein, with the addition of some of its own, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If anything black or yellow remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm: and if you wish, place upon it some aloe, or balm of myrrh: or something of the juice of mint, that is, calamine or something like that.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	Many wounds also occur at the knee and hip joints among the phlebotomists of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Put your hand over the area and if you find suppuration beneath your compression, then that swelling is bad
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, do as we have said concerning that thing
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood flows from that artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster over it with something that has styptic power, so that the place is closed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that every man should draw out of blood according to the quantity of his virtue
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the color of the blood above the blood itself.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it becomes red: and in the same way if you see it thick: then let it go out until it becomes thin: and in the same way if it is acute: then let it go out until the sharpness is gone
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for the full, strong, and indigent person to take only one draw of blood, so that the phlebotomy may be ample and the phlebotomist wide: and in the one who is feeble, let him do the opposite of that
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to draw it in vessels and that the opening be strict: and better is that which is administered in phlebotomy than a puncture, that it should be a transverse section, not a puncture
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, from the incision of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy by breadth and length
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	Whoever remains standing near the phlebotomist during a syncope must provide the patient with bread soaked in wine before the phlebotomy: or dry bread, if he is feverish. And take from him from the blood in three or four doses.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	If the patient is pale, take before the phlebotomy bread soaked in pomegranate juice, or in honey syrup scented with spices, or in scented rosewater.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If it happens that there is a syncope during the phlebotomy, and the cause of this is the escape of much blood: then it is necessary to take in the pot a little meat broth, and aromatic syrup of low degree: and let it be flavored with spices, and cool the patient with it: and do all that we said in the chapter on syncope in relation to emesis.</start_of_turn>
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to stop his arm and solve his blood by a second bleed: must take what has escaped from the phlebotomy because of much emesis, and be weak, so that he gradually solves the blood by the amount of weakness in the days following.</start_of_turn>
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wishes to stop his arm and solve his blood by a second bleed, and his body is strong: then do this after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.</start_of_turn>
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body in the opposite direction to which it flows: must do this in the second or third day.</start_of_turn
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is much hot blood, which is acute and causes fever: must be drawn out of him from a vein, and take from him in great quantity: and augment it by opening until syncope occurs: after which you will have restored all the conditions of the phlebotomy, and put your hand over the pulse of his wrist near the course of the blood, so that there is no more risk of syncope.</start_of_turn
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Many times, this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and neglectful.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	It should not be when one wishes to solve the arm and solve the blood second, when the orifice of the vein is closed, and there is difficulty in the exit of the blood, as it comes before to that with haste and extends the swelling sooner
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For indeed that is bad, rather let it go, until the phlebotomy is done second time
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or move it with the sharpness of the phlebotomy that which has clotted in the orifice of the vein, and put over that something of salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put over that something of thyme alopecarum, or sage, and put on it gentle compression, until the blood comes out
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the vein is already clotted, then let it go, and do not tighten it, until the clot has settled down.</start_of_turn>
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	And if necessity compels to solve the blood second, and it is not excused, then either perform the phlebotomy above the place, or in another arm in another vein.</start_of_turn>
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But indeed the vein of the arm is phlebotomized in the place of the cubitus, and of the basilica, when they are not found, and are hidden, because they are composed of bones.</start_of_turn>
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is that it lets the patient put his hand into warm water, until the flesh turns red, and the vein appears clearly.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it should be bound over with a ligature of moderate constriction.</start_of_turn>
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the phlebotomy should be done second in a transverse direction gradually, not latitudinally, neither in length: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be like that which you make over the palm of the hand that is near the wrist.</start_of_turn
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If blood flow is prohibited, then re-wet your hand in warm water and let the blood run off into the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If you are in the summer days, then you may excuse yourself from the repetition of wetting your hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And mostly it is put into practice that the course of blood is let into warm water in the cold season.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the letting of blood of this kind is more useful than all other methods, because there is no pulsating under this kind of letting, neither nerve
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The letting of blood from the right hand is beneficial for the jaundice of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this letting of blood is that you must bind the wrist of your hand with a ligature or your finger, after you have introduced your hand into the warm water, until the hand swells and the sense of cold disappears.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then let the blood flow across.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut the blood entirely, it will not cause any harm to him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to cut your hand too close to the phlebotomy
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under these there are naked nerves of the fingers from the flesh
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then re-wet your hand in warm water, and let the blood run off into it
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not re-wet your hand in warm water, the blood clots in the mouth of the vein, and is prohibited from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have therefore drawn out from the blood the quantity necessary, then put on the hand oil and salt: that it may not harden too quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And in the like manner it must be done with every limb that is strict
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The dressing of the left arm from the phlebotomy is thus: because it is appropriate for the ailments of the spleen. Do the same in the phlebotomy as you did in the second time equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The dressing of the phlebotomy of the saphenae is for ailments that are in the lower parts of the body, such as ailments of the uterus, retention of menstrual blood, kidney disease, ulcers of the buttocks and ancient crura, and similar ailments
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that it lets the patient put his foot into warm water: and make above it friction, until the veins are bursting: and tie above the juncture of the foot with a bandage.</start_of_turn>
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	The veins are at the heel, appearing under the thumb: and are pulled out from it on the face of the foot many times.</start_of_turn>
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	The phlebotomy is therefore to be done in the greater branch of the vein, or at the heel in its collection: because this is better and safer.</start_of_turn>
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If the phlebotomy is done on the face of the foot, then take care of the nerves that are under it over the face of the foot.</start_of_turn
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And put your phlebotomy through from the side, like you wish to cut through it: and let the phlebotomy be of the Nesil type.</start_of_turn
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If, however, the blood is prohibited from coming out, then do it again with the foot in warm water: and let the blood flow out through the vein, until it is evacuated.</start_of_turn
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotomist has made a mistake in the first attempt, then do it again with the phlebotomy towards the upper parts, for the place is safer, and does not cause harm, when you cut from the nerves, as we said.</start_of_turn
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	Likewise, with the other foot of the saphenous vein.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The vein of Sciatica is located, as we have said, at the heel from the lateral side of the anklebone.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	The sign of the vein is its swelling, when there is congestion of cold blood in the anklebone area.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	The quality of the vein is such that it inflates a soft swelling, and is quick to disappear: it tightens the ankle from the side of the ankle up to the heel for four fingers, with a fine long mark below, which does not appear except in this case.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then the vein must be evacuated by whatever means is possible, or by stripping: and it is better either to cauterise it by incision, or to ligate it by section
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	Its place is harmless, and in many men it is hidden under the skin.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it does not appear to the senses: then you must evacuate some branch of it, which appears in the back of the foot and below the heel: and cauterise from nerves, and make run out blood as much as you desire.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the tension, and place over the site of the phlebotomy a layer of skin, and tighten the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Note: The next section continues the discussion of the saphenous vein and its variations.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 103.</start_of_turn>
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Veins are derived from the bodies of blood vessels, from the air, and from the veins themselves.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And the sensation of the veins is of two kinds
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When the incision is made, and blood is drawn out: the other is the administration of medication without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this administration of medicine which is without incision, is according to two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with heat.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without heat
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the medicaments which are administered with incision and blood-letting are fourteen in number in the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	These include Ventosatio Alnocrati, which is the most posterior of the head: and Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck: and the unguents Alhagdahim, which are two layers in the neck from two parts together: and the unguents menti, which are under the mandible in the lower part of the mouth: and the unguents duarum spatularum: and the unguents Alachosos on the tip of the tail: and the unguents duorum focilium, which are in the middle of the two arms: and the unguents duorum crurium: and the unguents duarum cauillarum
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed the medicine which we call Ventosatio does not extract blood from small veins scattered through the flesh, but on account of this it does not cause a loss of blood like phlebotomy does
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Neither is it necessary that the medicine should be administered with heat or without heat in any ailment which comes from congestion, until the whole body is evacuated
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If indeed necessity demands that we should use medicine for an ailment, or because of custom, we shall administer it at any time in the beginning of the month, in the end of the month, and in the middle of the month, and at any other time as needed
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	For in men when they are multiplied in blood, until they grow weary of it, they find in their head a great swelling and a raging headache
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from the eye there is one who increases the swelling and redness in his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from the eye there is one who increases itching in his face, forehead, and eyebrows, and haziness and dimness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from the eye there is one who scratches the area of moisture of his eye.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from the eye there is one whose laughter increases
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from the eye there is one who increases the taste of blood in his mouth: either the tongue swells and expels blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from the eye there is one whose sleep increases
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from the eye there is one who bleeds in his sleep, redness, and moisture, and spots and things that are like them
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see anything of these things, and it has been more than two or three hours since they appeared, we then order that the moisture be driven out
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The ointment of the night is beneficial: because it causes a weight in the head and what flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	And indeed it should be after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	This is the treatment for cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	It is not permitted to use it on those who are cold in complexion or in whom there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings on a great swelling
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	For because of this it is not permitted to use it in the elderly, and in whom there are cold spots on the head
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever is excessive with it generates over the eye socket
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	Therefore, it is necessary, according to the instructions of the Wind-bringer, to place the hand with the palm downward towards the lower parts, fearing lest oblivion be generated.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	The Wind-bringer or Alkehel is the place of the vein of the Fusca, and of the vein of the Basilica, and because of this it brings about swelling, constriction of the breath, and cracking of the instruments of the breath, and vomiting, and distension.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	It is necessary to push the Wind-bringer of the Alkehel downwards, for if it is placed downwards, it generates stiffness in the heart and the stomach
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The Wind-bringer also causes headaches, sneezing, and pain in the temples, and swelling, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is the place of the vein of the Basilica
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary, according to the instructions of the Wind-bringer, not to place the hand too quickly with the scarification: in order not to tear the artery and to cause the flow of blood to be stopped.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The Wind-bringer under the chin brings about swelling of the tongue, corruption of the gums, and similar things which are in the mouth: and it is the place of the vein of the epiglottis, which are in two folds
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The Wind-bringer of the sputa brings about swelling of the face, which is caused by reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The Wind-bringer of the inner parts of the two cavities [chest and abdomen] brings about the drawing together of the veins of the uterus, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalic: for it attracts blood from all these small veins which are in the flesh: and these small veins from other large veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	It is necessary, therefore, that the surgeon take caution, so that he does not go too far with the incisions: for the place is stripped of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and blood vessels.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	However, the wind which is applied above the ulcers, brings about hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	It is necessary, therefore, that the surgeon take caution, so that the wind be great and dry: for the place requires strong suction, and the fine veins may perhaps be torn by the incision: and the incision should be great
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The fine veins of the limbs diminish in size noticeably: for they draw blood from the whole body, and cause old aches in the buttocks, thighs, and groin: they bring on menstruation, and cause swelling, and stiffness: and they are in the place of two saphenous veins, and the horseshoe-shaped bones
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	But they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	The horseshoe-shaped bones are near the two large veins.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The position of the veins is such that you should place the greatest suction at the first incision, and temper the suction: and do not prolong the position of the suction, but move it quickly, and move it away quickly, so that the humors come to the place where they have been driven equal: and do not cease doing this until the place is red and swollen, and blood appears red: then you may safely make the incision, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the position of the body.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who has little flesh and few hairs on his body should make the incision once, not more: so as not to ulcerate the place.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And command the Wind-blower to increase the depth of the incision slightly, and to temper the suction in order to facilitate, speed up, and cause the flow of the blood.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to make the incision twice
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first instance, a small opening is made under the thickness of the blood, and its swelling: and in the second instance the accurate incision for the extraction of the thick blood is made
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is foul and thick, then a third incision should be made: in order to achieve the ultimate result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	Finally, when we wish to extract the blood gradually or in small quantities, a single incision is sufficient
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	When we wish to extract a large quantity of blood, we make multiple incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we are measuring, that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that the incision be deep: and the end of the incision is equal to the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What must be done concerning the oils that are administered at the position of the Wind-blowers? And what is the cause of the wind-blowing?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	With regard to the skin which is thick, hard, tough, and has close pores, it is necessary to anoint the area of the Wind-blowers with open, soft, and resolving oils: if it is in summer, such as almond oil, or oil of rue, or sweet fennel oil, or pumpkin seed oil
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	Or if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or balsam: and similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the excess is great and cold: then the oil should be bitter almond oil, or balsam oil or white oil, or balm: and things like these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the belly is swollen with many porcupine quills, have soft meat: then it is necessary to prevent it from being pressed by oil, and it is necessary that they bathe the place of the quills after having them extracted with rose water, or with cold water, or with salt water, or with cucumber water, or with rainwater: and in like manner.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	If the blood of a person is of much humidity, bathe the swelling with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and saffron: and in like manner.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	If there are many large boils, bathe the swelling with old wine, or with alum, or with fennel decoction, or chamomile: and in like manner.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the swelling be kept warm in a bath, or in a bathhouse, for it is better that it be administered after coming out of the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not permitted that anyone should sleep after the treatment.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that is necessary to do before the treatment of the swelling, or before the extraction of blood?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after the treatment it is necessary to consider in the first place: if the swelling or the bloodletting is choleric, and if the blood is of great heat and inflammation: then it is necessary to take coolness, such as pomegranate juice: and also fennel with vinegar and lettuce, and chicory, and ivy: and in like manner.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put on clothes of wool, and fleshy meats are forbidden, and foods that are eaten with barley: and in like manner.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if the complexion is cold, it is necessary to take in pottage of honey, or of almonds, or of linseed oil: and take a moderate wine, which is between new and old: and it is prescribed that one should eat sparingly of food
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	Place the meat on the cocks, and dogs: and sparrows, that is, parrots of the air: and the meat of pigeons is to be boiled.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	The broth of the day of fasting and blood-letting must be more abundant than the food: and it must be given in broth in some man in the hours of the tyriaca alfaroch, or medicine of muscle, that is, muskate, or alethiote before fasting, or after: in order to comfort the principal parts and subtilize the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it must not be taken with warm broth.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Of vomiting without incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Those vomiting which are without incision are those which arise above the spleen, and the kidneys, and the foot, and above the belly, the navel, and the place of the kidney, and the testicle: for these members do not suffer incision over themselves
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not to be sought by ease, except by pulling out from a blood vessel to a limb: as we do vomiting over the nipples in the flux of blood from the veins.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we must be cautious that we do not make the vomiting of a cold liquid from one limb spread to another: as we do vomiting over the belly, and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it itself rarefies the limb, and heats it, and drives away the pain thereby, because it resolves the vomiting.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also put over the kidneys, when it happens in an oily or muddy fluid.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For the vomit itself has a strong attraction and perhaps opens the opilation, or eliminates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And in the same way it does when it is put over the spleen and the kidney alongside the vomiting in both of them
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	These winds are administered with small incisions.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered with lukewarm water in the cavities of the chest: and this is done by applying the wind and making it great, with only lukewarm water, or water in which some herbs have been boiled that are appropriate.</start_of_turn>
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the wind administered with fire.</start_of_turn>
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Its size is two open fingers wide, as we have formed it: and its quantity in depth is half of a palm, and its lateral position is at the middle of its length, with a small opening according to the quantity of the needle: let it be of air, or citrine, of thick borders, soft, even, and thin, so that it does not injure the limb in its position above it: and there is a transverse wire in the middle of it, of air or iron, on which is placed the candle with fire.</start_of_turn
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And thus this wind is made great, greater than we have said, and a little less than that, according to the ailments and the age of the patient who uses it.</start_of_turn>
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	The winds of children are weak, and those of the extenuated are other than those of the adults, and those of the thick-bodied.</start_of_turn
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this wind with fire upon the limb is that you should raise the lint with fire from the center of the candle, or put a candle wick from the wax: and put it on the middle of the transverse wire which is in the middle of the wind so that the flame is surrounded by the lower part of the wind, that it does not burn the body of the patient.</start_of_turn
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	And then it is placed on the limb: and the finger is placed over the opening which I mentioned, until we have finished with the wind: when we are finished, we remove the finger, and the vapor escapes through that opening, and the wind is immediately relieved.</start_of_turn
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then give the purgative according to its measure, and repeat it again if it does not work.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In wounds which are treated with powder of alum in wound of the chest with water, there is no need for an enema, neither for a fistula: it is not to be administered except when the wound is filled with water, and is placed upon the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is the way to do it.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	The greater the quantity of Ventosa, the more it will absorb the water
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	On suspension of blood-sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-sugars are not to be administered in many places, except in those in which it is not possible to position the enema bags, because of their small size, such as the lip and the tongue, and things like that.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a limb stripped of flesh, such as a finger or a nose, and things like that.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of the powder is that it should be made from blood-sugars which are in sweet waters, freed from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are given every day and night in sweet water, until the patient is satiated, and does not remain in their belly anything
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is evacuated in the first place with phlebotomy, and with enemas.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the limb of the patient, until it is red
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then put upon it again
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are full, they fall down, and it is possible to suct the place with an enema, then that is the last in the treatment: and if not, then remove the place with vinegar
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then when the water is much, and the wound is open, and is expressed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	When the blood flow is prolonged after the fall of the blood-vessels, and it is that which is flowing out: then pour oil of linen into cold water, and place the wound above it, until the flow of blood is stopped.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	When blood is excessive, then grind over the wound some powdered alum or gallic acid, and similar things from sponges: until the blood is stopped.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or apply over the place the middle of cloths scraped from the bark of trees: and let go, until the cloths adhere to the place, for the blood is stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if necessary to repeat the blood-letting, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If however blood-letting is forbidden from suspension, then the wound is to be cauterized with recent blood
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or let the point be fixed in the place, until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then apply, for they adhere immediately when they feel something from the blood
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When they wish that they should fall, grind over them something from aloe which is ground, or salt, or ash: and they will fall immediately.

Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know ye, sons, that they who handle this book of the art of healing and of wondrous remedies, and who have never once perused the works of the ancients, neither have they learned anything from them by letter.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	For this reason it is that this method of learning is shut off in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	I have never learned anything good from it (this book), and I am not learned from it in any way, except by the length of reading the ancient books, and by the study of their intellect, until I had extracted the science from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	And then I adhere to experiment and the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have set down for you in this Chapter all that concerns my science: and after that I have described the experiments which I have made, after I had abridged them for you, and I have set them down in order to abbreviate, and I have set them down at the end in order to decline: and I have made various forms of the instruments which are used in this book, adding to the decline as I have mentioned in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In summary, and the collection of the nature of fractured bones, which is necessary before we proceed to the recollection of fractured limbs and diverse parts of the body
Caput II.	(The text following this point is not included in the request and is not translated.)
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we say at the beginning of this Chapter, to recall the sum of the discourse and the chapters, to which the intellect of the first craftsman is applied in order to reach their perfection: namely, that you, and they who are prompt, may know, or learn, that this noble art is not for everyone.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, when any fracture, dislocation, twist, or fall occurs: then it is necessary at once to apply phlebotomy and solve it, or both together: if nothing else hinders, such as weakness of spirit: or is he who has done it to him a boy, or an old man decrepitus: or is the time urgent of heat, or urgent of cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, with cold herbs, and with poultry and blood: and let him abstain from drink, and from coarse meats, and restore himself from food and from all food which fills the veins.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	When he is cured of the heat of the after-flux, and does not fear the effusion of matter to the limb: then let the patient return to his ordinary regimen as soon as he can with which he is accustomed
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the bone is beginning to heal, then it is necessary, that the patient should eat nourishing and bulky foods, such as barley bread cooked with water, barley meal, heads, feet, beans, fat, fish: and strong drink, and things like these.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regimen the coagulation of the fracture will be faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in the joints which are in their first old age, and decrepit, it is not possible that they should continue and consolidate according to their natural course always, because of the wasting away of the limbs: and they consolidate and continue only what is in the end of leniency, like bones of the newborn calf
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	But nature adds upon the broken bone from all sides something like glue, which is of great thickness, which adheres and binds it, until they are congealed together, and bound together, until it comes in the end to strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, until it is not hindered by any operation: and for this reason it is necessary that you should give the patient nourishing food, which has abundance, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that there are various kinds of fractures, according to the diversity of the limbs: for as the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the head: and the fracture of the breastbone is different from the fracture of the back: and in the same way all the other limbs are different from each other: and I come with the remembrance of the kind of fracture which is exposed in his chapter distinguished from the others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	Diverse forms of bone fracture also exist within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For indeed, such fractures are arched, apart from the fact that they happen alongside splinters.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when a fracture happens along the length of the bone: such fractures are of the saddle type, that is, splinters, and protrusions, like those in the quill, when the blade is applied to write
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	Not from that: and it is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the head: and it is a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every kind has its own wisdom, or its own instrument for restoration, according to the memory of its restoration, distinguished in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	From which it is known that a fracture of the bone is its tortuousness, and its prominence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When there is no apparent tortuousness in the place, nor any sound on touching the bone with your hand, nor does the patient experience great pain: then it is not a fracture, but it is possible that there is only a slight fracture or a slight displacement: it is not therefore necessary to move the limb with the hand and compress it completely, but rather to place above it the hands of the physicians who know the remedy, after which the tightening should be done subtly
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	Know that when an arc fractures, and breaks into two, apart from the splinters that happen alongside, the whole limb is really moved from its place: then you must start from the beginning to restore it, equating it before the swelling becomes cold
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if swelling occurs, then defer it for a few days, until the swelling subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then, equalize it according to whatever degree you wish with lenity and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	You also know that the restoration of it and its equalization are easier than bones, in which wounds happen frequently.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then, tighten it up according to what reminds you of its nature.</start_of_turn>
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If indeed there are wounds in the bone, then necessary is the expansion of this fractured limb from two parts, if it is the hand, or foot: or with the hand, if it is a small limb: or with two strings, or with a cord and a hand.</start_of_turn
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such as to place the limb on an equal level, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then try, so that you can make them join again with all ingenuity, and according to whatever degree you can manage in the places: and be cautious according to your strength, lest you cause more pain or injury through your operation; and try according to your strength, so that you apply one bone against the other, with its partner, according to the better shapes.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is proper in this hour to test and touch your hand.</start_of_turn
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If there is anything different there, correct it, and equalize it according to the degree of your skill.</start_of_turn
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be cautious of excessive extension and compression, as do many solid things.</start_of_turn
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many do these things cause their wound to become cold, or contraction in the limb: as we have seen with these operations of theirs many times.</start_of_turn
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind up after equalization, and loosen the operation, and tighten that limb, and rest, and tranquility: and give the infirm person rest above it.</start_of_turn
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make the patient recline, so that he does not move during the hour of his greatest heat, and that he sleep in his usual position, without commotion or movement, and during evacuation.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And so that he does not sit in a position which causes pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	For when he feels pain in a position of a limb, or an injury: then it is necessary to change him to another position from that in which he does not feel pain
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And make him recline so that his position is even and straight: so that no bending of the limb occurs when restoring him
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	The degree of fracture of the limb is known by me.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that fractured limbs are varied in their degree, in their size, and in their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	As for the small bones, such as the arm, the finger, the heel, and things of that kind, then it is necessary to apply soft padding, fine.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	As for the large bones, such as the hip and the thigh, it is necessary to apply a wide and hard padding in the limb
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the wide ligament which connects the great limb and tightens it from all sides, equal tension, so that it does not yield to the injury.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after evacuation, place on it a suitable ointment from an equal part, in a soft cushion over the place of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then bind the limb around the place of the fracture with three or four layers of dressing, according to the need of the limb: and hold the hand firmly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then draw up with the ligature to the upper part beyond the fractured place, and tighten less than the stricture which you made at the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then draw up with the ligature from the fractured place downwards, and soften the stricture gradually, until you have restored the great part from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take hold of the other end and draw it over the fractured place again with ligatures
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then draw up with the ligature to the lower part from the fracture
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightening of the ligature and the softening of the same, as we said in the first upper ligature
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the ligatures some soft material, or a cloth, with which the fracture is to be made even: and if there is no twist in the fracture, do not put anything in that.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then draw up over the other end once more.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then make the two ligatures equal over the place where they have been made immediately, if there is no swelling, neither a hard swelling.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If however there is swelling or a hard swelling in that place: then put over that which sits upon that swelling, and remove the swelling: and let go of the ligature a little every day.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten over that once more the ligatures
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the ligatures be from the middle of broad bones, round, formed wisely: or be made of wood from which cribra are made, which are made of a stick, or hemp, or palm leaves, or rushes. And let the width of every ligature be according to this form, and this same figure
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	But it is necessary that the ligature which is put over the other end should be thicker and wider downwards, than the rest of the ligatures: and the length of the ligature should be according to the size and the condition of the limb
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then string over Astellas with another, following the first stricture.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind over with strings as before, with a centre, following what we said about the stricture: that it should be more strict than the fracture: and the more distant the fracture is from the stricture, the less strict the stricture should be
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that there be middle strings in thickness and flexibility, and that they be of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the strings are thick, like the threads from the operation of split bones, it is a great error: for the stricture will fall out with the foreign bodies.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin strings do not suffice again: for you do not follow through with the stricture with the foreign bodies that you wish to retain
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not right that there should be less than a finger's breadth between the Astellas.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	For if the patient is injured between the Astellas after the stricture in healthy places: then place under the foreign bodies a cushion of soft wool, or carded lanolin, until nothing is injured from it
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with a wound, and it happens that there is a rupture in the skin, I will speak of this in the second chapter concerning the singular case.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured limb needs to be strung with Astellas from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	For when the limb is great, it is not necessary to place over it so many Astellas, except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the after-effect of the heat
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the manner of dressing for fractures and dislocations which the ancient people used to employ.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common abbreviated plaster, restoring the fracture, suitable for various complexions, especially women and children: because it does not cause heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	Take from the flour of barley the fine powder which hangs on the sides of the millstones at the turning of the mill: and mix it so that it is neither too thick nor too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Use it thus.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another plaster, restoring fracture, dislocation and torsion.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Recipe: barley, laudanum, acacia, enula, mugath: and vinegar, all together 10 myrrh, and aloes two and a half, and alethium 20 parts are taken, all of which are pounded and mixed with alethium water: or with alum if the complexion of the patient is hot.</start_of_turn>
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Use this plaster thus.</start_of_turn>
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good composition, restores fractured bones quickly, and is suitable for many people.</start_of_turn
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another plaster which also heals fractures and torsion.</start_of_turn>
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe: mugath, barley, white alum, all together 10 myrrh, and aloes two and a half, acacia six bolus armeni twenty parts are taken, pounded together in much powder, and mixed with water, or with alum. And they are administered.</start_of_turn
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A plaster for uniting fractured bones and separated bones from their places: and it soothes the pain of the accident, and closes the fracture of the bone.</start_of_turn
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take fine wool soaked in vinegar, and boiled wax: and put it on the place.</start_of_turn
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this case of Emplastro, there is no benefit from the restoration, but it is good to keep the afterburn of a warm calid: and it expels the pain itself.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The treatment for Emplastro is to restore the fractured bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of fennel and leaves of bay laurel: and figs, and make an ointment from both of them
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The abbreviated method of Emplastro is administered during the restoration of the fracture of the bone: and when you desire the resolution of the remaining afterburn.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe of the root of chamomile, and camomilla, and the flowers of violets, and barley flour, all take one part: they are boiled together with wine, if the limb is not warmed up
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If the limb is warmed up, then mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of Emplastro is stronger for resolving, than the first, when it happens that afterburn is hard during the restoration of the limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe of the root of chamomile, and linseed seed, and barley flour, and honey, and mastic, and violets, and camomilla, all take one part, they are boiled together with salty water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	The whole thing according to the heat of the limb, and the quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates himself did not say in his book that anything should be placed on the fractured limb during its restoration, except for butter made from cheese, and oil: nothing else. He says that there should be a middle ground between the thickness and thinness
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, considers it useful to place on the fractured limb during its restoration things that contain the exication of heat, such as myrrh, aloes and olibanum, and similar things which we have mentioned
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of applying the plaster which confers to the wound and the pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Method of applying plaster which confers to the wound and the pain.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	As much as is necessary, in order that the ligature remain, thereafter it is to be softened, that is to say, that you consider that in the case of an incurable pain, neither itching, nor movement of the fractured bone from its place: then do not soften it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If there should occur to it in the place itching or torment, or swelling: then be quick, and soften it in an hour, and remove the plaster from it: and apply a soft cushion, or marine sponge, soft: and immerse it in lukewarm water, and wash away with it the place, until the itching cease, and the pain be still
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put upon it clean wool, immersed in vinegar and oil, or oil of roses: and bind up upon it at night once, until you are secure from the heat of the afterburn, and the swelling of the limb is still, and the pain is removed
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat it to the slight tightening, and a little plaster: and do not bind it too tightly at first, and make it gentle with it, until it be healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	When the swelling, the redness, and the pain, and all the accidents are past, and digestion of the plaster and the tightening is complete, then repeat all this as before equally
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing further happens to the limb of which we have spoken, then do not soften it, except after three days, or four, or five, or seven days
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	When the wound has healed for twenty days in all, according to what appears from the solution of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture has rejoined and coagulation of the flesh over the wound has approached: then add further restriction than the first throughout: and also add restriction of food in accordance with the preceding reminder.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if the place of the fracture has already begun to become loose and to expand more than is necessary: then you know that food must be restricted to it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore keep him warm with tepid water at all times while you are treating it, and let this be for three days at least, and reduce the restrictions.</start_of_turn>
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this treatment, food is restored to the limb and healing is accelerated or accomplished more quickly.</start_of_turn>
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	What they do who make the restoration of the limb from the fracture with other means than those which are proper, except when it is necessary, is an error in their practice, and a great fear: for if it had been right, the ancient writers would have said so in their books, and they would have operated with them.</start_of_turn>
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	I have never seen any evidence of this in all my life, and it is better to do nothing than to do this.</start_of_turn
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Of the treatment of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	(The text continues with additional sections and paragraphs.)
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fractures are diverse, and their figures are many: and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture is that which is made by an impact with a weapon: and the impact raises the whole bone until it reaches the marrow, which is under the bone, like an axis in wood: and for this reason this species of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	If any bone is fractured and breaks the face of the bone, but does not penetrate to the innermost part of the bone: this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, which is to say, complete fracture.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	It is a common fracture, either great or small.</start_of_turn>
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	A fracture is a break, either complete or incomplete. The cause of this is impact with a stone, or a fall from a height, or something similar.</start_of_turn>
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	This kind of fracture is also either penetrating or non-penetrating. The penetrating fracture approaches the bone marrow, either on the face of the bone or in its substance. This is a serious fracture, either great or small.</start_of_turn>
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	There is also a fracture which is hidden in the substance of the bone, under the layer of hair. This is a small fracture and is called a Capillary fracture.</start_of_turn>
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	There is also a fracture which occurs when a blow or impact causes the lamina of the bone to break inwards, and causes concavity. This is like what happens with blows of the wind, when something blows inwards.</start_of_turn>
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	This mostly happens in the heads of soft bones, such as the heads of young children.</start_of_turn>
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	All these different kinds of fractures are separated from each other, and I will mention them all in their place.</start_of_turn>
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	We recognize all these kinds of fractures by their appearance on the surface, their location, and the loosening of the corrupted flesh above them.</start_of_turn
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The Capillary fracture is recognized by the fact that it appears on the bone, is stripped away, and is covered with ointment: the fracture appears black.</start_of_turn
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In treating fractures, consider first the signs of the sick person: then, if you are of the opinion that these signs signify something manifest over fear, such as vomiting of bile, and swelling, and loss of intellect, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and discharge from the eyes, and redness of the face, and similar things which are in many conditions, it is in vain to expect recovery unless you treat these signs. If you do not consider these signs to be serious, and you hope for recovery, then begin to treat him.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If a wound comes to you in winter at the beginning of the month, then it is necessary to study the evacuation of bone before the fourteenth day of the month in every case.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	If it is in the summer days, then it is necessary to be careful to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it becomes corrupted under the membrane, and these things happen in many cases.</start_of_turn>
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If a fracture of a bone has reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is small and accompanied by traction: then it is necessary to cut away the broken part and the traction, as I have told you.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is necessary to reduce the head of the wounded person: and determine over the bone in whatever way is possible: and according to the figure of the wound and what is useful for the patient.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens to you at the time of detecting a flowing of blood or a hardened abscess: then oppose it with that which is necessary.</start_of_turn
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is necessary to place the place with soaked cloths in wine, and wet sponges: and make the wound quiet, until the abscess settles, and be secure from the flow of blood.</start_of_turn>
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then commence with the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The first method is as follows: you cut the bone with a curved chisel and a straight chisel: this is its form
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then give the chisel another blow after the wide chisel has been applied: this is its form
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	And give another blow with the wide chisel yet again.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is as follows: you have several chisels of different sizes: some are wider than others, and some are narrower than others: and their tips should be sharp and made of iron or lead: and use them easily on the chisel, so that you do not break the head and damage it
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If, however, the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary to perforate its circumference before you apply the chisels, with a needle that is not too deep: and it is not called by that name, except when it does not pass beyond the limit of bone cartilage to that which is after it: for the needle is the rounded extremity above that, which is under its sharp point, like the margin, and a small circle prevents it from submerging, and from passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting that you take many needles of these, whose number is appropriate for the thickness of the bone, until they are all above the bone: whose acute extremities in length and breadth are in proportion to the thickness of that bone
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three species of needles, or trepanas.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the perforation in the circumference of the fractured bone is: to place the needle on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the bone to another place, and put between every hole the amount of breadth of the radius, or somewhat less.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisors between every hole of the bone: make it thinner than the thickness of the bone at its thickest point, as we have said, until you have cut through the bone, or your hand, or with any other instrument which you have at your disposal: such as tweezers and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to take care that you do not touch the bone, or any instrument.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have surrounded the bone with the perforation, and it is separated from the surrounding tissue, if it is still connected with anything, grasp it with another instrument similar to the incisor and pull it out.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	But it is necessary to make it thin and smooth compared with other instruments.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remain any small bones and fragments of bone: grasp them easily with the instrument which is beside you
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound afterwards as we have mentioned, and with the unguents which we mentioned earlier.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another way of performing the operation is easy, far from fear: which Galen praised highly, and which is his own saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is not necessary at first to remove the part of the bone which is more fractured and prominent: until you have removed that part and placed under it the tip of this lens-shaped incisor which has this shape
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	The tip of the lens does not penetrate anything: and the acute part of its edge is wide on its two sides in length, like a wedge: so that the lens-shaped part is close to the surrounding tissue, making the acute part of its edge on the bone
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike above the Incisorium from one side with a small hammer until you have pierced the whole bone easily, as it will recoil: and you will be safe from the nail, which does not happen in this case as you fear beforehand.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	Even if the physician is not stupid among men, and is more ignorant of this than anyone, or if he is asleep, then if anything remains attached to the bone from the nail in some place, he will pierce it from there with the lens of the incisor itself and will liberate it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is liberated from it without pain, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the bone is not pierced through to the nail, and that which is broken off from the bone is its face, and remains in it rough and spiky: then it is necessary to remove that roughness, and to grind away those spines with fine files of various quantities, so that it is possible to administer from them in every place where it is convenient, and to make them straight, according to what the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone itself, and its figure
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary to administer in your reason, that in the first place you should radiate the larger files, and then the smaller ones.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the finer one afterwards.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing this until you have reached the finest, and most delicate of them all
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	With every little fracture remaining of small hairs, and the fracture itself being delicate, it is necessary to take care, according to what leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing which is not hidden over everything, to which in this art there is anything studious, and which stands over that which we have written, and which we have shown in great fractures
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If the wound persists after you have closed the bones: you must take up a piece of lint, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in oil of roses, and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of lint, doubled or tripled, and moisten it in wine and oil of roses, and place it over the first piece: and make it as easy as possible to bear on it, so that it does not swell up
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then bandage the surrounding area: and do not tighten it, except for the amount that will hold the wound only: and remove it when the wound is secure from the heat of the afterburn.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then wash it and give it the necessary medicines which are appropriate for such a case: such as the roots of lily, and the flour of herbs, and barley flour, and marigold, and the like of these: and make from these medicines a powder, which shall be sprinkled over the wound as though it were dry powder.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And in general give in that all medicines that have the property of draining and not biting
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care according to your experience, so that the wound may be soft in your care: neither greasy nor dry bloodstains.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Neither let blood clots form in it in any way: because when blood clots form over the wound of the brain, they corrupt it and cause it to putrefy, and this brings about great mischief: and this happens in the swelling of the head, when it is neglected and its care is omitted, black spots appear on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore now, if such serious accidents happen to you, you know that it is dangerous to delay treatment.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	If the blackness does not depart, except for the medicine which is put upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make it black: then it is necessary, that you take from the honey one part, from the rose-water three parts, and lines as many as there are grains of sand.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put it upon the wound: afterwards take care of it with the means which are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	When the nose is fractured, restoration must be delayed
Caput IIII.	Chapter III
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose is not fractured except for two of its upper parts together, or one of them: because they are two bones: for the lower one of them is cartilaginous and does not fracture, and does not depart except for attrition, and twisting, and simulation
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is fractured, then it is necessary to insert the little finger into the hole of the nose, and to equal the fracture with the index finger and the thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this with skill and ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	Take care, that you do not cause further pain by your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and does not yield to the insertion of the finger: then it is necessary to equalize the thickness of the radius at the small curvature
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If there is a fracture in both parts, then do the same: and be careful with the restoration in the first day of the fracture, if possible
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	If not, then after the seventh or tenth day from the setting of the wound.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the extremity of the nose a strip of linen from the cloth of the bandage, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two strips if the fracture is in both parts: and let the strip be of such a thickness as to fill the hole of the nose
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	Some of the ancient restorers have said that they infuse gum into butter and change it every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	It does not seem to me that this is necessary; indeed, it would be better to infuse gum into barley flour mixed with fine powder of bread
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the gum until the bone is firm, and apply ointment.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	When the gum has been introduced into the nose in the place of the sponge of an ointment pen, after it has been covered with a soft cushion: then the fracture of the nose is held more firmly, and prevents the sickly person from being stifled by inspiration.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	This is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do so; if not, do the gum.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If it happens that the nose is again fractured while you are working after the swelling has subsided, plaster the nose with plaster, or with burnt ochre mixed with fat, or with some other salve.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If the swelling has subsided, then it is necessary to plaster it with wheat flour mixed with burnt barley flour and butter of almonds
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place over it a soft cushion, and do not bind the nose with anything whatsoever.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If indeed the bones of the nose are fractured by a slight fracture or bruising, then it is necessary to split them apart with instruments that are suitable for this purpose and extract them
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then cut them apart, and care for the wound with what is necessary, and consolidate with suitable bandages or unguents.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If there is a nail or splinter in the nose, then it is necessary to remove it with sponges: and give him a lead weight until it is healed
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured.
Caput V.	On restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is fractured and its fracture is not associated with a wound: then consider if its fracture is only lateral, and not fractured into two pieces, and that it is directed inwards: then its knowledge is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, to insert the index finger of the left hand into the bone of the patient: similarly if the fracture is on the left side, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push with it the bulge of the fracture inwards with ease along with the other hand from the inside outwards, and with the same hand from the outside inwards
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the lower jaw has already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to manage the expansion from both parts, according to their direction: until their equilibrium is possible
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however there is displacement in the teeth, or rupture: then bind those from which you hope that which remain with a thread, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put over the fractured jaw a cushion.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put over it a doubled pad, and put over the pad a large sponge made hollow: or a piece of the sole of a shoe of equal length to the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it up above, according to what is prepared for its ligation, and agree with its application, until it is not destroyed: and command the patient to rest in peace and quiet: and give him food of soft consistency.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If however you estimate that something has changed with the figure or mode: then be careful, and solve it on the third day
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then mend what has been altered, and plaster it with fine flour of wheat, with alum or with sesame flour, after you have removed the tumor: and put on a layer of soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that plaster remains attached to that, and does not change the position of the bone, remove it, do not dissolve it, until it has healed: or bind the fracture.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	Many times this fracture is bound for seven days.</start_of_turn>
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If in the meantime a callous swelling should happen, then manage it as we said before until that swelling has subsided.</start_of_turn
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it.</start_of_turn>
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if it is separated from the bone fragment, or from the satay: then be careful in this, that you do not increase the fracture with those instruments.</start_of_turn
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the opening of the wound is strict, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the quantity of necessity.</start_of_turn
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed that fragment of satay, and nothing remains of it, seal up the opening of the wound, if it is wide: and if not, put on over it the necessary plaster, and bind it, until it has healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On restoration of the Furcula when it is fractured.</start_of_turn
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.</start_of_turn>
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the Furcula is most frequently fractured from the front part towards the humerus, and the fracture of it is done in one of three ways.</start_of_turn
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it is fractured and separated into two, besides which they happen in those satayes: and that is easier for its restoration.</start_of_turn
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or thus, what happens in the case of a fracture of the bone of the thigh: it is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or thus, when there is a fracture with an ulcer.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in such case when there is a fracture without an ulcer is that you must keep two assistants, one of whom holds the fractured fragment in place, and the other extends the limb above the fractured part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture of the fingers of your hand, until it has attained its proper shape, as it should be: and let it not be prominent, neither hollow
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If, however, it does not straighten out by extension alone, then it is necessary to place under the knee of the patient a ball of wool or felt: and let the size of it be according to the quantity of necessity. And extend and elevate the fractured limb, and cover the ball with the hand, until the fracture is equal, as it should be
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If it is not possible to pull the limb of the fractured bone outwards: because it has gone deep: then it is necessary to recline the patient upon his chest: and place under the elbow of him the middle finger of his hand in size, and keep his arm minister to the lower part: until the bone of the fractured limb which is in the depth has been raised up: and then straighten the fracture and equalize the fingers of your hand
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel swelling from the fracture, and it moves: then it is necessary to find above that and extract it easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If, however, it is retained in the bone, then make an incision in it with one of your surgical instruments which you have prepared for this purpose: after you have placed under the fractured limb an instrument which will hold the bone in place. And the instrument is of wood, or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is like a cochlea which has no cavity
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	Its breadth is according to that from which it proceeds from the magnitude of the bone, and its height/width is small.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length is also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two extremities like a pair of tongs: one extremity is wide and the other is narrow
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, you tear the wound when you extract the clot from the bone, it is wide, and secure it from the heat of the afterburn: then join together the two lips of the wound with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the tear is small, or the afterburn is slight: then close the wound with pieces of lint, and with sponges according to the quantity of the wound
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If there is afterburn, then pour oil of roses, aceto, and wine over the wound and put on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The stiffness of the bone, however, when there is no wound and no section, is to put over the bone a plaster made of ground barley with almonds or eggshell.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put on a soft cushion over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	And put under the head a sphere if you do not digest it
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a sponge, which is like the one which the Saracens hold, which is long and wide: and its breadth is like that of a palm of the hand, or somewhat less
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	And put a doubled sponge over the cushion and the plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	And take a needle from a thin board, whose breadth is three fingers wide, and in length like that
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then immerse the wound in the cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then immerse the wound in the cloth covering the fractured area that is above the break and the surrounding area.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the bandage over the fracture as if rolling it up, and immerse the wound above the collar of the healthy side and below the collar of the diseased side: and reduce the wound over all parts, and as much as the dressing holds the fracture steady: and this is what is not visible from above, and all, so that nothing is disturbed from the fracture itself.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason it is necessary to wash the diseased area every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever the ligament is softened and the dressing is loosened: then rectify that and tighten the ligament
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient to sleep on their back, and place under their chin the small pillows in the night, so that when they are raised up their attendants will support them on their side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the collarbone is elevated by elevating the arm
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind the arm to the chest: and do not loosen the ligament unless a wound occurs from itching or from a swelling, until twelve days have passed
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the dressing if you see its face to be wet
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And repeat the binding, and loosen it, until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the collarbone is bound and comforted according to many for eighty days: and in some people in less time
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the collarbone.
Caput VII.	(The remaining text is not included in the provided context.)
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the spatula break, and in its wide place: and they do not break from its margins.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When it breaks from that place, and breaks in its middle, and it is not known except by touch: then it is necessary to prepare it according to the form of the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it in accordance with the natural form in every way that is possible.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put over the place fine powder of mill with alum, and a soft cushion, and put above it a double layer of cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put over it a wide bandage from a thin board according to the quantity of the spatula, or a little more.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed under the bandage there is a concavity in some place of the spatula, then equalize that concavity with a soft cushion until the bandage descends evenly
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind it up again with long silk, gentle tension, and firmness of the bandage, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever it is softened, string it up, and equalize the bandage if it moves from its place: and let the patient lie on his sound side
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is restored in ninety days, or in ninety-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is completed, then loosen the ligament: and you will be secure
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from the bones whose communication does not change, and whose solution does not take long
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however it proceeds from a broken bone, and protrudes under the skin: then split over it, and remove it.</start_of_turn>
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we have said concerning the fracture of the furcula from the sedation of the apostematis calidi, if anything be added to it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	And do as we have said concerning the fracture of the breastbone from the sedation of the warm afterpulse, if anything be added to it.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.</start_of_turn>
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone sometimes fractures in the middle, and this is rare.</start_of_turn>
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities of it are indeed most frequently fractured, and they break from its accidents.</start_of_turn
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it fractures in the middle, which inclines downwards, and there is pain, difficulty in swallowing, and cough: and perhaps blood is omitted, and there is a bulge in the fractured bone, which is not hidden from sense. The restoration of it is that the invalid be placed upon his back: and put between his shoulder blades a cushion.</start_of_turn
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his arms, and bind his ribs from two parts or from two sides with hands: and twist them in its equilibrium, according to every possible way which can be done for it and which agrees, until the shape of the bone is restored, as it should be.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place upon it a compress and a cushion, and place upon it a bandage of fine gauze from a willow, or from hemp, or from something similar in lightness, after you have bound up the hand.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then twist the bandage around the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and keep it firm with a bandage according to the roundness of the body, and bind it tightly.</start_of_turn
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage at every hour, and every time it is softened, tighten the bandage: and if its necessity indicates its solution at the swelling, or corrosion which happens in the place, or pain, or apostem: then expedite it, and solve the bandage, and remove the compress, and straighten out what has happened in the method of its treatment.</start_of_turn>
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	If the wound is on the face, reduce the dressing and bind it tightly until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	When the bones are fractured, restore them.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that a fracture of the bones does not happen except in the great places which follow the backbone, and from the extremities of them from the anterior part
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And does not happen except for this, because they are cartilaginous
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the sense in the examination with the fingers
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in such a way that it makes the fracture even with the fingers as much as possible, until the figure is equal, as it should be
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then the dressing, and bind the fractured bone with a pin if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the bones is downward towards the inside: then it happens with great pain which is unbearable, and swelling, as in those who have pleurisis: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also it happens that there is difficulty with breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of blood: and this is a difficult healing.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients were skilled in this with many skills: and among them are those who say that you should put on bandages the sick who cause inflammation and swelling, so that the belly inflates, and expands, and drives out the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We, however, abominate that it should be a cause of making the swelling worse, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however it happens, then join in it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them say: put on over the swelling place, then draw it together with force, and this is similar to the calculation
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Truth be told, when moist substances are drawn towards a location, it is due to the disposition of the disabled.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	Some have said: It is necessary for the place to cooperate with the wool which is already submerged in warm oil: and they put in feathers between the ribs until it is firm: so that there is an even ligation when you roll up the belly according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then one must care for the wounded man with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If one binds up a patient too tightly with that which he cannot tolerate, and if the bone is pierced with a wound that is gaping, and we fear that the patient will die: then it is necessary to split open the place and remove the fractured rib bone
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we put over this an instrument which preserves the fat, whose memory has gone before: and we break the bone easily and break through the bone itself
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we join together two lips of the wound, if there is a large one with a suture: and we care for it with poultices until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If in the meantime a swelling becomes hot, then cool it down, and pour pultices of rose oil over the place: and put on it: and care for the patient with what agrees with the swelling.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Even between times he rests on his side over which he sleeps, until he heals
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of fractures of the rib and neck bones.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	The bones of the neck when they are fractured sometimes happen by attrition: and in the same way the rib bones also.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When this happens to anyone, and you do not know whether he will heal or not: then keep quiet
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	If you aid the hand when swollen, stiff, and dead, it will not move, neither extend nor contract: and when you compress it with your fingers and needles with an awl, you do not feel pain, neither do you feel it in its insides. Then you know that it is not healing, and that it is deadly.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	When it moves, and you feel constriction in its insides with your fingers and needle, then you know that the bone is broken, and that it will heal only with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If you bring close to each other the pain of the back like that of the hand, and you do not know whether it will heal or not: then look at its feet. If you aid what is softened in the hands and comes into this in the back: then when it lies over its belly, there comes out swelling and discharge without its will. And when it lies over its belly and wishes to move, and it cannot: then you know that it is deadly.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	It is of no use to work on its cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing happens to it from this, then it is easier.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	Its cure from this is that you bring near its afterburn with the warmth of oil of roses: thus, put on the back what is attracted to the Spondila with olive oil or balm.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Put on it at every other time in the day until when the afterburn has subsided: then put on one bandage over the place and cover it with a soft dressing, and bind it up with a thread: and command the patient to rest quietly and peacefully
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Let him not sleep over the part where he has pain until it has healed
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If anything happens at the attrition of the bone of the thigh, or if anything is separated from it: then it is necessary to cut above the skin and raise it up.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then join together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some nourishment, from unguents, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the thigh bone is fractured behind and the end of the leg is hanging: then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the buttock, and equalize the fractured bone in the hand, according to what is possible, and with the second hand.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place above it [the bone] and elevate it: and care for the wound with the care that went before, until it heals.</start_of_turn
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Of the restoration of the limb.</start_of_turn
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.</start_of_turn>
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely are the bones of the limb fractured.</start_of_turn
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are fractured, then the fracture of them is not, except for a dislocation in the extremities: and they are torn along their length, and bend inwards: and there results mild pain in the place, and swelling: and the leg that is fractured becomes stiff.</start_of_turn
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the fracture as well as it is in its figure.</start_of_turn
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in the extremities of it, then equalize the fracture, according to what is prepared for you from the equation, until they are equal in figure to their natural form.</start_of_turn
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If the fracture is in length, or if it hangs downwards towards the interior: then let the patient lie upon his belly until restoration of the fracture is prepared.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When the fracture has become even, put upon it a dressing: then put upon it a bandage of wood or leather: and bind tightly over which you fear not the displacement of the fracture, nor the removal of the bandage.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the swelling with that which the dressing will contain: until you have taken hold of the fracture with a tight binding: and command the patient to rest upon his back, or upon his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, a callous swelling should arise: then cease from its extension, and from its restoration: until the callous swelling has subsided: and put upon it what has subsided, as before, and return to the restoration of it: and bind it as seems good
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If indeed it happens in a bony prominence, or is fractured, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Of the restoration of the fracture.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.</start_of_turn>
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The aid is that which is between the elbow up to the head of the scapula.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If indeed it is fractured, then the restoration of it is according to one of two methods.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of them is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape.</start_of_turn
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligatures are bound at the two extremities.</start_of_turn
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from a high place: and the patient sits upon a seat.</start_of_turn
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he will project his fractured arm over the wood until it reaches the elbow of his limb, in which middle there is an attached fragment of bone.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then he will suspend something weighty above it, so as to extend the limb downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician will stabilize the fracture with his hands, until the fracture has healed, as required
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the patient should rest on his bed: and suspend his arm from his neck with a ligament
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants, that one should hold that which is above the fracture with his hands, and that the other should hold the lower one, and that each of them should extend his to his part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if desired, in order that the extension may be stronger, then bind under the fracture with a ligament and above it with another ligament: and extend both of them by two assistants to their two parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is close to the elbow of the arm, then it is necessary to put on one ligament under the elbow and another under the fracture above the elbow
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And in the same way if the fracture is close to the forearm: then it is necessary to put on a ligament over the place of the wound, and over the forearm itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then stabilize the fracture easily without toil, until the fracture has healed according to what is required, and apply a good dressing: then bind it up, if it has not already gone cold
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If indeed a cold swelling has occurred, then remove the bandage until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put upon it a soaked bandage in vinegar and salt, until the swelling has subsided: then bind it up: and the way of binding it up is that you put on a plaster on the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a new patch over the wound.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then take hold of the limb with your arm, and open your hand over the shoulder bone.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	Put on a bandage, and bind the limb with your arm so that the limb is fixed in place without hindering you from anything or causing you any pain from the fractured bone
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If at any time you notice something wrong with the fractured bone, put over it the larger and stronger bandage of the two
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every bandage a width equal to the breadth of a finger. And let the length of the bandages be according to the fracture plus three fingers from all sides
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the bandages as I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And let your binding be tighter over the site of the fracture
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	The more prolonged the fracture, the tighter the binding should be
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you observe the position of the bandages and the binding at the time you restore the limb, do this: and if you notice swelling, loosen the binding and the bandages until the seventh day, as we have said before
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in every three days, so that no pain, swelling or impediment to the passage of food to the limb occurs due to the tension of the binding
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Do all this, as we have said before
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If you are in doubt, do not loosen the ligament before three days, or more
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	Let the patient rest with their head on their chest, and their hand on their stomach: and place under the support a full cushion of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	Consider at all times of night and day that the figure of the fractured limb should not be allowed to become loose, or the ligament should not be softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	The limb should be set firmly in its entirety for your entire care
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And provide the patient with food in accordance with the order we have given, so that it be light in the beginning, until the bone begins to knit: then it is necessary that you increase the amount of food gradually.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	As for the attendance of the attendants and the patient, it is necessary that the limb be bound for forty days: then it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath should be administered, and that unguents be applied which will rectify this
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture be dirty or raw: then do not loosen the ligament or the fragments until fifty days have passed, and until two months have elapsed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Regarding the restoration of a fractured limb.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are named the two ulnae.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is the forearm: and that which follows the thumb
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	The other is the forearm, and that which is placed under the forearm from the lower part
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the large bone is fractured only, or the forearm: and perhaps both together
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the upper forearm bone is fractured, then the restoration of the same is easy, and the healing is more rapid
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower forearm bone is fractured, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones are fractured together
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If the bone which is fractured is slightly above the navel, then the physician must be present at the restoration of it, in order to place the extension of the gut with ease, until it equals itself.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If the fracture is of a large bone: then it is necessary to place a stronger support around it
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	It is necessary to place the hand figure at the restoration of it and to extend the limb beyond the elbow
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	The thumb should be placed above the wrist of all fingers and the lower joint of all fingers, or of some of them: and the patient should sit square upon himself, and the elbow should be at the level of the shoulder or somewhat above it, so that the patient does not incur any pain.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then extend the arm from below, or with the hand itself, or with the ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And the other limb extends in the same way from above
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician must equalize the bone, until it is reduced to a better shape than before
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are any protrusions in the fracture, then try to reduce them in their place without haste.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If there appears in it a separated piece of cartilage, which has pierced the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find above it and remove it in the manner which we mentioned above
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If however the fracture is with a wound, I do this for the head alone, and take care of the cure from that moment on
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If at the beginning of your restoration you see a soft swelling, then draw the gut with a piece of cotton wool which has been made fine, and white, and put the middle between the thickness and the thinness: and bind the gut over it with a fine suture until the swelling has subsided: then remove the cotton wool, and put an ointment prepared from pounded wheat with albumin or oil.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place sponges, and let the sponge which is placed over the fracture be wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of sponges for the arm is six in various positions: if the fracture is in one cavity, or in two cavities simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage firmly over the fracture stronger and more tightly, and a little more with the bandage above the fracture, or below it: or place a softer bandage under the previous bandage alongside it, according as the recollection of it was at the beginning of the chapter
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths which cover the fracture, soft cloths, moist: and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread which is drawn from the linen itself be medium between subtle and coarse, as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything happens whose rectification is necessary, such as itching which occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to bathe the limb with warm water until the itching ceases, and then loosen the limb, until it is quiet, then repeat the bandage
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage is already softened, and the bone is already removed, and things are similar to these: then rectify all this with your skill, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if the nourishment is hindered from reaching the limb because of the excess of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and let it rest for a few days, until the nourishment reaches it again, then bind it again
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if no ailment happens to the sick person of the things which we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to break it off, except after eighty days or so
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the patient is suspended at his collar.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	The collar is made equal, and his body is guarded from disturbing movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	Let him sleep over his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	Know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps in eighty days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All this is according to the arrangements of the temperaments, and the arrangements of virtue
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Of the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that the bones of the hand and the nodes of the fingers are rarely fractured
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And do not happen to them except for a great attrition.</start_of_turn>
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore such a fracture of the bone happens, or an attrition: then it is necessary that the patient sit square: and before him be placed a seat equal in height.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand over his extended palm.</start_of_turn
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then extend the minister of the fractured bone, and the doctor must make them equal, until when they are reunited with a good junction.</start_of_turn
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he put on a plaster and a bandage, if the swelling does not subside naturally.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then put on a bandage above according to the quantity of the place: and I put the hand into a linen cloth.</start_of_turn
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is towards the lower part round about the wrist, then make like a sphere of cloth: and command the patient to keep his hand resting on his fractured bone: and bind it with a long cloth.</start_of_turn
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the stitches be from the skin, in which there is softness, so that the skin may be applied to the body of the plant: and bind them firmly, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary: that you put a stitch above and a stitch below in the plant: and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put a support, as it is bent by the hand: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If it happens that the fracture is of some bone of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, make it equal according to what is necessary
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind with the plant: and if there is swelling, put on a straight stitch, firm: so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is of the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little, then make them equal, and bind them with the healthy finger which follows them: or bind them all together: and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put on the tip a firm stitch, as we said concerning the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the setting of the wound: and oppose with it what is necessary, when anything happens of that, according to the course of its story.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the thigh bone.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The thigh bone is fractured many times, and it is declared by sense: because it curves inward and outward parts
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done thus, that the ligament is sutured above the fracture, and the ligament is sutured below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the infirm is returned to his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then extend all the ligaments around the part to its side according to their equality: and this is when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If however the fracture is close to the root of the coxae, then let the ligament be around the part of the hip so that the extension may go up: and let the other ligament be under the fracture
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus in the same way if there is a fracture close to the knee, then let the ligament be close to the knee so that the extension may go downwards
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician must fix the bone with both his hands, until he has reduced it according to the likeness of its natural figure: and join the bones with a good suture.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to put on a plaster and bind it, if the limb is not restored after the fracture
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	And if this happens in the restoration of the limb: then leave it for a few days, until the limb becomes calm, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	And the stricture of it is like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to cover over the fracture with a firm covering, that is, a bandage: and double it twice, or three times: and remain from that excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then cover the leg until the heel reaches the root of the nail.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the coxae and the leg near the knee downwards, and bring the ends of the thread from the upper part of both parts
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll up over the leg and the coxae what is in excess from the other part
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put on the coxae in the place of the fracture itself little nails, and put on a nail from above on the bone of the leg
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the cavities between the thigh and hip with wool pads, so as to equalize the tension.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin by making the tension strong from the middle above the fractured area, with three or four inversions
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you lengthen with the ligament from the fractured place, the less tension you will have, and the softer and more gentle it will be
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then take two threads to the two extremities which you have introduced between the hip and thigh
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie them thus with both three threads that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then lead both thread extremities down until you reach the heel of the foot
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when you have tied both strings, also bind the extremities of the pins from the other side: so that the ligament does not slip from its place
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the tension above it, while it remains, so that no fracture, no swelling, nor inflation, or the like occurs to it.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	Which if anything should happen from this
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Then act diligently with its solution and restore what happened from the beginning, as we have said many times before
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If there is a piece of bone that projects from the bone: then it must be leveled, if this is possible.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find above it, and remove it: and take care of it until the pain has passed away
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	When this fracture of the hip is bound, besides the pins which are added, do as we said in the treatise and in the arm
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	But do not let it be that in restoring it, the fracture should become weaker
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides what is applied to the other limb, then it is necessary that the limb which has been closed should be opened always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the coxae is strung out in fifty days, or is added slightly, or diminished slightly: all this is according to the diversity of complexions and the remaining parts.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	About the restoration of the fracture of the knee-joint
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the knee-joint rarely happens to fracture, but it often happens to it to be bruised many times
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If it happens to fracture, then it is not without a break or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	It is just as with a wound, and without a wound
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it remains in that state with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is in this way, that it be equal to what has been disrupted from its parts with the digits, until it is joined together again, and connected according to what is possible with equality and with facility, and with fabrication
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put on a dressing of barley flour or meal with albumin, or oil: and put on top of it a round bandage, if necessary: and bind up from above with a convenient bandage to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements which we have narrated in the other fractures: thus as a cold poultice, and the like: thus, that you oppose every accident with that which is suitable to it, until it is healed
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	About the restoration of the fracture of the thigh
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the thigh has two bones, of which one is thick, and is called the Cruris: and the other is thin, and is called the Focile
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens in both cases from the species of fracture which happens to two bones of the forearm: and because of this its restoration is effected, just as the restoration of the forearm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones break together, the forearm turns around to all parts
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	If a thin bone breaks, the forearm turns around to the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	If a thick bone breaks, its lower part is found: and it is from that from which the bones do not appear.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and equating, and ligation of the tendons according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	It is true that if the fracture of the forearm is a compound fracture, having many lacerations: so that the extension is less, and the alleviation is more gentle to you
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the forearm there is something from the operation which is more than for the arm: and it is that when you equal the tendons and perform all your operation, then grasp two bands of pine wood which are administered in the fabrication of solar plates which are placed under the boards: and they become from the palm splints: and choose from those which have a small thickness, and neither are they from the smallest: and let their length be according to the length of the forearm from the knee to the lower part
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then bind over one and a half fingers two bands according to its length
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And put one part of the forearm from one side, and the other from the other side: and they are from the knee to the lower part of the foot
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	And bind two bands in three places from two extremities and middle
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When the tension is forbidden, the forearm declines to the right and left, and remains in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And thus is administered a cubulum of wood according to the length of the Cruris, and is placed in that Cruris, that it may preserve it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And much more is required, that you make it firm in fracture when it is its own bone
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the Cruris every day, and study it with the utmost care from the apostemate, or swelling, or any other thing.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If anything happens to it from these things, then oppose it with that which is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of fractures of the bones of the Foot and Fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The Calcaneus never fractures completely
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the Foot indeed fracture sometimes when a fracture occurs, and the Fingers somewhat also: and it does not occur except by rubbing in various positions
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs in the bones of the Foot, and you wish to lift up that bone above itself, then place the patient's Foot upon the prepared Earth, like a walker
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand still, and place your Foot upon that which will lift up these bones: afterwards press, or apply a heel: and keep it equal, until it returns to its place
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a compress, and bandage: and place under the Foot a board having two flat heads
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind the Foot with a strong bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloth and other things as necessary
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When three or four days have passed, or four, then loosen the ligamentum
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	You perceive the bones to be equal, whether they are fractured or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation is thus in the bones, like water
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If any fingers are fractured, then restore them, and make them equal as before, as I have said concerning the restoration of the fingers of the hand
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger on the splint according to the length of the finger, and let it be broader than the other: then place under the hand this board which I have mentioned, and bind it securely.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed that which is fractured from the bones is two, or three, or more, then place upon every finger a splint of its own quantity, bound in linen: and bind the board in the lower part of the foot: and let it rest upon one head of the board outside the foot, so that it may retain its stability
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is convenient for you to remember, that you must consider all that I have said concerning the remaining fractures from accidents which we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of the woman's vulva, and the bone of the thigh, and the swelling of the man.
Caput XIX.	(The provided text does not include the content of Chapter XIX, so I am unable to translate it.)
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her to the side towards the back of her, and keep her firm behind
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife grasp her vulva with her hand, until she grasps her: and make within the vulva like a sphere
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman groan, and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	The limb thus departs from the socket until it stands before the gate of Vulua like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a cushion over its back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When he wishes to move, move the limb easily, then mix: and reduce it as before, as you introduced it at the beginning: then return to its cushion first
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Do this for seven days, or thereabouts, and the bone will be restored
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if necessary, take the urine from the privy, and apply it over the opening of the wound, and insert the whole bladder into the belly.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the bladder with urine, until the bladder is inflated inside the belly, the fracture will be restored.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then keep it bound with the limb, and rest for a few days, as we have narrated, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	When the bone of the breast of a man or a woman is fractured, then manage its restoration, and give it the same treatment as we have narrated for the bone of the elbow.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And do not hide the rectum in its near fractures, which are of little importance, especially for one who has studied or is skilled in this matter.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for in many positions the fracture itself indicates to you the right way to restore and straighten it: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But in the case of a man who is in the Virga when his bone fractures, take the tip of the tongue: and insert the tongue into it itself
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place above it an ointment from a cloth, and bandage it, and leave it for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills it
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of fractures of bones, when associated with a wound.
Caput XX.	In the restoration of fractures of bones, when associated with a wound.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is necessary in the restoration of fractures which are associated with a wound, especially if they are large, such as the femur or the pelvis, or similar to them, so that the wound is properly restored, and phlebotomy is performed immediately: if these conditions of phlebotomy are confirmed, as we have mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If blood flows from the wound, it is necessary to ligate it immediately, so that the surrounding tissue is not powdered over the wound: if nothing else is present in the vicinity
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then commence the restoration of the fracture on the same day: do not delay it, if there is no swelling
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed swelling occurs, then defer the restoration until the ninth day, until the swelling has subsided
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	Do not approach it in the third or fourth day, for you will cause him further injury
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If, however, the fractured bone is prominent above the skin, you must reduce it and level it with your hands with ease and small extension
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If it is not prepared for extension, and its equalization with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the instrument is made of iron, its length is equal to seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the size of the wound
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And it is necessary for the physician to take from him three, or four according to the quantity required for the cure of any kind of fracture
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	It must be round: and be of small size, so that it does not double under compression in the hour of operation: and it must have a sharp point at the extremities, which must have a margin at their extremities
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And above it to the breadth from the middle to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that you place the acute edge of the instrument curved over the prominence of the bone: and push it with the same until the bone returns and is equal to the surrounding parts.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	So to make the extremities of the fracture even with each other
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its extremities are slightly fractured and do not grasp the instrument well, then you must cut off the end of that bone until the instrument has the power to grasp it
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed it does not suffice to reduce them as we have said before, then cut it with the knife which we mentioned before: or draw out the bone with a saw in any way that is possible to you
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then remove what remains of the bone from the asperities and small fragments.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When it has been reduced and finds itself after reduction in pain and discomfort, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural position
Fac ergo illud.	Do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you must confer great comfort to the patient when you finish your restoration of the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the wound in vinegar, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	Do not place on the wound a wet cloth or anything containing oil: so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then give the patient some urine at the end of your restoration of the bone
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	Release the identified wound: thus, you shall cut with scissors the opening in the folds according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	Take heed of all caution, lest you tighten the wound with a fracture.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many have done this out of pride: and they have caused harm to their patients either by death, or corruption, or ulceration, that is, harm.</start_of_turn
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	Let your closure be soft, gentle, diverse from the strictures of the remaining fractures.</start_of_turn
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or if it is large, and the times exceed what we have mentioned concerning the other harmful events, and you find pain in the suspended part: then it is not necessary to place upon it nails.</start_of_turn
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	Make for it incisions from tough papers in the place of nails, and tighten it with them.</start_of_turn
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, a day or two has passed, and the wound begins to swell, so that pus is generated: then remove from above the dressing which you placed upon it with wine.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then give astringents and unguents which are customary to us for healing wounds: thus as the tetrapharmacon and the like.</start_of_turn
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting that you should suture the ligament.</start_of_turn>
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	Consider the wound every day in the morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the limb be prepared in like manner, so that the pus may flow down easily.</start_of_turn>
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If the days of the wound pass by many, and it does not consolidate, and the pus does not drain from it: then you know that there are small bone fragments there.</start_of_turn
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why should one inquire about the condition of a wound with tentacles?
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of these slimy things [tentacles] should be separated from it [the wound], and when should they be removed?
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And what is left of these [tentacles] should not be left attached, but should be pierced through the limb and cause pain, and they should be cut away in any way that is possible for it.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If an ulcer bursts or swells, that is, if there is a wound, or any other corruption or putrefaction: then it is necessary to oppose each one of these things with that which is suitable for its cure, as is mentioned in its chapter
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And concerning this matter concerning which I have spoken, and to which you should pay attention when a bone is fractured, and protrudes from the limb, like the hip bone, and the knee, and similar parts of large limbs, it is necessary not to fear its attraction, for much harm arises from it, or even to expel it until it has decayed
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps indeed it will fall away of itself after eighty days or a hundred days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then indeed the wound must be treated if you see it: and if not, expel it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Note: The provided Latin text does not include the next section of the translation, so I am unable to provide the English translation of that portion.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times this happens in the process of healing a fracture
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially when near the joints: and it is made worse by that figure of the limb
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider it if there is a nodulation: administer in it medicines which have styptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and the like
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Take some of these and all of them together. Mix them with vinegar or with albumin or with vinegar of aceto. Place them over the swelling and bind them with a good strap.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	Do not remove the dressing, and do not change it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then wash the wound and do it again later, until the swelling has subsided.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind them with a layer of lead in the middle
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead has the property of removing all that is harmful from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If, however, the swelling is in a solid mass, and is firmly fixed, and causes pain, there is a need to remove a part of it: then find on the upper part of it, and cut away the excess: or remove it with some instruments, until it is removed: and care for the wound until it heals
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	When the wound has healed, and the limb remains under the skin, do not act contrary to its natural tendency.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the bone is healed, and the limb remains under the skin, it is weak: then it is not done except for great causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Because of this, many things are done concerning the solution of the ligament and its ligation which are not in accordance with what is proper: either because of the excess tension of the ligaments, until the nourishment is hindered from reaching the limb; or because of the abundance of superfluous embrocation at an inappropriate time; or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the patient, and the weakness of the latter
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the care of it is to nourish the patient, and to keep his body warm, until the blood is multiplied in him.
Et administra balneum.	Give him a poultice.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	Introduce joy and gladness over him.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put pitch over the limb: so that it attracts moisture to itself a great deal.</start_of_turn>
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And be diligent in rubbing it with warm water, until the nourishment recover its natural form.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	When the bones are restored, after they have been fractured, care for them.</start_of_turn
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a limb has been restored after its healing is finished, and the fracture of the bone, or swelling: care for it in such a way that the limb does not prevent itself from doing its natural work. Therefore it is not necessary to break the limb again for that reason.</start_of_turn
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there are many proud doctors and restorers in our land who have done this.</start_of_turn
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this work is very dangerous, harmful, leading to death, or great fear, as it is mortal.</start_of_turn
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the swelling and fracture are recent: then it is necessary to poultice it with warm water, in which there are decocted soothing herbs, such as elder leaves, and the root of it, and mellilotus, and things like that.</start_of_turn
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make for him an ointment with a soothing plaster, such as gypsum made in the center.</start_of_turn
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucus of the elder root, and mix it with pork fat, or almond oil: and plaster it on with that.</start_of_turn
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take pitch pine cones, and grind them with columbine seed meal, and things of that kind which the doctors call to diminish consolidation.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	When the knot is loosened with persistent, old, and soft friction, as when hands are wet.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the limb is administered to every part at all times in every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If, however, stiffness has preceded and become strong, and has become fixed in the lap, and has been provoked by necessity, for its treatment with iron is required: then it is necessary to cut above it, and to loosen the continuation of the bone, and to remove whatever remains of the knot or bone with fine cutters: and to administer ease in that place with care and attention
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	About the word 'Dislocation'.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of a joint from its place
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it hinders its movement and deforms the limb's figure
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes the superimposition of excessive pain, and wounds that are harmful
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When, therefore, any dislocation has happened, then it is necessary to hasten to restore it: neither must it be delayed at all
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place is left behind, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation itself
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it is not permitted to move or extend it in the hour following the dislocation
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it makes many spasms and painful pains occur
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when it has happened, then it is necessary to prepare for a vein-cutting of the patient
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	And afterwards let it be quieted until the swelling subsides
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	And then the limb is bound with warm water and oil
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it is reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And it heals every limb with that whose memory comes back to its place
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed ordained the chapters of dislocation, also according to what has gone before in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the care of dislocation of the lower jaw.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.</start_of_turn
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Rarely do two mandibles dislocate at the same time.</start_of_turn
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both is done according to one of two methods.</start_of_turn
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Either they are moved from their places by a slight displacement, and they are softened in passing.</start_of_turn
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely, that is, until they are softened to the breast, until the saliva of the infirm flows over them, and they cannot hold their own limb, neither can they close their mouth, and their tongue is involved with speech.</start_of_turn>
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however the dislocation is slight, then it returns by itself in several positions with little pain.</start_of_turn
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If however the dislocation is complete, entire: then it must be done quickly, that is, the reduction must be administered without delay: and it is necessary that the minister of the infirm should hold the jaw steady: and the physician should introduce his thumb of his one hand into the root of the mandible which is dislocated between the bones of the jaw, if the dislocation is from one side.</start_of_turn
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he may introduce two fingers of his two hands simultaneously, if the dislocation is from both sides.</start_of_turn
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the rest of the fingers of his hand are outside, which equal.</start_of_turn
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to move his mandibles freely and to open them to eat throughout.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor should move the mandible and stimulate it until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If its reduction is difficult, especially if both mandibles are together: then apply warm steam with oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: do not reduce them both entirely as we have said
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they are thus reduced and equal, and the patient's bone is closed, and is not softened: then place over the teeth cotton wool, with wax that has been made from beeswax: and apply rose water.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	And it should be bound with soft ligaments
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	The patient should rest supine on his back: and his head should be placed between two cushions, so that it does not move to the right or left: neither should it be constrained or forced to chew: rather let him eat soft food, until when he feels better, the pain has gone and the mandible is relaxed: then he may eat whatever he wants, and this should be administered with care.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let him not work or eat excessively during the operation of his mouth at the meal and at the drink, and at the biting, until the mandible is relaxed and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of both mandibles is difficult, when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their place: then many times fever and bile occur: and perhaps the patient vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see this: you know that it is a loss, and many times the patient dies from this in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	(The provided text does not contain any information regarding the reduction of dislocation of the furcula or the extremities of the humerus, so I am unable to translate this portion.)
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The thyroid cartilage is not displaced from the inside due to the continuation of its process with the sternum.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	It is sometimes displaced outwards: and this is discerned by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	Its restoration is that the patient should lie on his back and extend his arms
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then cover the place with your strong hand, for it will return by itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put over it a compress, wool, and a string.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The lower parts of its extremities which follow the elbow, and which continue with it, are not displaced, except rarely
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is displaced on some other day: then it is necessary to reduce it and make it even according to what has been said, and to prepare it accordingly
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put over it a compress, wool, and a string.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the patient to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when the same treatment has reduced the limb of the humerus, even when it is separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the humerus
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus is not displaced except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	The first is that it is displaced to the part of the elbow towards the lower parts.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it is displaced towards the part of the chest
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	The third is that it is displaced upwards of the humerus: and this happens rarely
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not slip backwards because of the sputum.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not slip backwards because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it is mostly displaced and departs downwards towards the heel: especially in those in whom the flesh is little
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For it comes out quickly in some cases and enters quickly in others.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those in whom the flesh is much, it is the opposite, that is, because it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people by a blow or an accident, and the Humerus is displaced by a hot abscess, and it is thought because of that that it is displaced
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary therefore to experience this until you are certain of its extent, and then you can proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And it is recognized that it is displaced when it is downwards towards the heel: and you must distinguish between a displaced Humerus and a healthy Humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find among them a clear difference, and you will find in the head of the Humerus a depression and under the heel of the Humerus almost at the touch of the hand as if it were a bone: and it is not possible to reduce the hand to its natural position, nor to move it in any way.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	Similarly, if it is displaced towards the chest or upwards: then you will find a palpable mark, and it will not be hidden
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And in these cases the displacement is easily reduced when it is recent, or when the patient is young.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And the reduction of it is as though you lift the hand up to the shoulder
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under the edge of the wound, and lift the suture upwards to its proper place: and the minister will elevate his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place the lower hand downwards, and immediately return the hand to its place.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If, however, it does not return by that which we have said, and there is from the beginning displacement of days many: then it is necessary, that the sick man be bathed in warm water, and that an embolus be administered which will soften and soothe, like the decoction of wild rose-roots, and fennel, and melilot in water, and that it be administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient lies down upon his back: and under the edge of the wound is placed a sphere and a bandage, which should be equal between softness and tension
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician places his heel upon the sphere, and elevates the arm of the patient with force, and draws the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another minister holds the patient's head, so that it does not move downwards: he himself immediately returns to his place.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if desired, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you make the present man who is longer than the patient stand at the side, and let his arm pass under the wound of the patient: and elevate the edge of the wound upwards, until the patient is suspended in the air
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another minister grasps the patient's hand downwards within his belly
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If, however, the patient is pale: then it is necessary, that he be suspended with something else, in order to lighten it: for the displacement returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that you fix in the ground a long stick, whose head is rounded like the sleeve of a coat of arms: which is neither thick nor thin
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then is placed under the patient after those are placed over the head of the limb of water-linen: and the patient stands according to the length of the limb.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then is extended his hand downwards from the other side, and his body is extended from the other side with force: for the suture returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	Which if difficult be its reduction by all that we have said, then take care of it thus: and it is that you take a limb whose length be equal to the measure of two arms, and whose breadth be equal to the measure of four fingers, and whose thickness be equal to the measure of two fingers: which has a round head, that it may alleviate its entrance into depth of the wound, according to this form
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then are bound over the round head of the limb water-linen, that it do not grieve the limb of the patient
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then is placed under the wound of the patient, that the hand or arm be extended over the limb: and the limb is bound over the adjunct and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then is placed the arm over the degree of the scale for the width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is let down from the other side
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The suture enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When it is thus completed the entrance of it according to whatever manner is possible: then it is necessary, that you place under the wound a sphere equal in quantity of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a prepared dressing of ground chaff with olive oil and albumin over the whole arm, as is usual above
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind under the wound a decent suture: and turn the ligament over the dressing above: and connect the hand to its neck, and let go, neither move the hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	It is necessary that food be placed for the sick person until the limb is comfortable: for thus is it quicker to heal.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then food is placed after seven days, or five, and is discontinued when movement returns.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it remains firm and is not softened, then it is healed
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the limb is dislocated many times, because of the humidity which has occurred to it, or for another cause: then it is necessary that an incision be made with three holes, according to what is stated in the chapter on cautery
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If this is done completely, and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the dislocation does not persist, and the swelling and tension above the limb are reduced, and does not firm up, and falls away, and does not lift up the limb towards the shoulder: then you know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus are either cut, or stretched, or softened: and you know that the dislocation will never take hold in its place
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	A dislocation which occurs towards the breast and the armpit, or towards the back, is reduced with a push and an extension with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining tension and care are administered until it is healed
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing there is still greatness in the limb, and tardiness in its movement: then the sick person is to be bathed many times, until the greatness is softened, and it returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	(The text following this section is not included in the request and is not translated.)
Caput XXVIII.	(The remaining text of the document is not included in the request and is not translated.)
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You know that the dislocation of the Cubiti is difficult, and returns with difficulty also: and it dislocates towards all parts, and especially towards the front, or towards the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its displacement is not concealed: because it hangs down under the skin and under the touch, according to whatever figure it is displaced.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the displaced limb with the sound one, it is declared that it is evident to you
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The limb is united and cannot be doubled, neither can it touch with its own shoulder
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to take care of it promptly, and reduce the displacement immediately, before a callous swelling occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a callous swelling should occur, its reduction will be difficult: and it may not be healed at all, especially if it is at the back
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	In every kind of displacement there is pain: and it increases with swelling: and it often descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is possible to reduce it, is that you extend the limb with two hands: and the limb is expanded, and the hands of the physician are above the elbow and below it, and he impels the union with his thumbs together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or else the displacement is to the front: then it returns like this, that you double the hand with the limb, until it touches with the root of its palm the displaced elbow
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the displacement does not obey reduction, then manage the extension vigorously: and keep it firm: that is, extend the limb with two ministers: and hold it with two ministers also, so that it does not move during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	And then the limb is turned towards all parts after it is covered over with the doubled long panus or the broad ligament
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the limb, let him smear it with oil: so that it is lubricated with the things that aid in the smoothness of the joint
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then it drives the suture forward with tension until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	After its reduction it is necessary to place above it the dressing which has been applied, in which there is styptic material, and which should be dried with alum. And it should be sutured securely.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	The arm should be suspended from the collar of the patient: and it should be allowed to rest for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be dissolved.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If, however, the suture remains fixed in its place, then the ligament should be severed from it, and the latter should be discarded.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if the suture has not been properly secured, then repeat the dressing, and the ligament and discard it for a few days until it is secured
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then dissolve it
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, there should be pain after the reduction of the suture, and the arrangement should be moving: then apply moisture to the bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until the pain subsides, or put above the suture some lint, that is, wool fat
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	And it should be bound, and be allowed to rest above the dressing day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove the dressing, and put it into a bath
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it is wet, then gently friction the suture
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	And repeat over it three times with warm oil, once, twice, and three times with the introduction of the bath, until it is softened
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if desired, put upon it soft wool fat, wet, warmed with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this every day
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state.
Caput XXIX.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	She herself is softened, and returns to her own state
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If, however, its movement is obstructed, and something heavy has fallen into it: then soften it with warm water and gentle friction, until it becomes soft.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	In case of dislocation of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When the finger is dislocated from all its parts, or from the palm of the hand, or from the wrist: then extend the finger and manipulate the dislocation with your thumbs until it is reduced
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the finger and suspend it with a bandage over the part which is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is restored to its proper position on that day
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night has fallen, bind it according to the instructions given: and do not cease to loosen it daily: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for a few days, until it is healed
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same in the case of dislocation of the wrist: and bind it to the part itself, and do the same with your first operation, until it is healed
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same in the case of dislocation of the other parts
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Chapter 31. In case of dislocation of the shoulder joint
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When something has happened to the shoulder joint, or a complete dislocation of the collarbone, or many bones of the shoulder have been displaced from their places: then it is not in this case that treatment is necessary, because the poison is harmful to the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the sick person departs without wishing to stay, and is unable to keep still: and they soften various parts of it, or two of its limbs, or two of its arms, or one of them: or they displace one of the bones from its place
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Many are the things that are moved, because many are their removals to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Many are the things that are moved, because many of their removals are to the posterior, and are called Gibbositas.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The care of the latter is such, that if the Gibbositas arise from infancy, it is not in that care, neither is there any healing from it
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	However, in those things which arise from an accident, or from a blow, or from things like these, as the ancients said in a long discourse, their methods of treatment are old.</start_of_turn>
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Most of them do not return when proficiency is restored.</start_of_turn>
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I myself have abridged from this, because of the proximity of my purpose to it: and the manner in which I have exposed it, and the form of my instruments differs from that which they have shown.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say, therefore, that in the Gibbositas which arise from the anterior part, there is neither ingenuity nor healing from it.</start_of_turn>
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And in like manner in those things which are done to the two sides also.</start_of_turn
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured except for that which happens in the proper back, as I have said: and that is, when the sickly person is stretched out over his face over a level base near the wall: and when there is stretched out under that a moist instrument, so that his chest is not bruised.</start_of_turn
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight stick is placed fixed in the fire in the ground, at the foot of it, round about the head: and another stick is placed round about the feet at the other foot: and the minister holds the stick, and it must not be fixed in the fire.</start_of_turn
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other attendant holds the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then hold the head of the patient and soften the ligament under the cheekbones: and stretch out the end of the ligament to the bone that is near his head: and bind it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then bind another ligament above the armpits, above the knees and at his buttocks
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligaments and bind them to the other leg which is at his feet
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then stretch out all the attendants at the parts of the ligaments, and do not move away two bones from the places in which they are fixed: indeed they should not be fixed too tightly, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor places his palms on the spine with strength, until he recovers: or places them on a board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he binds his feet to the board until he recovers.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, he does not recover by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And put the heel of the board against the wall from which we said that it is near the patient, the place where the extremity of the board will be placed
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the doctor places his feet on the other extremity
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And bind well, until the vertebra are firm and recover to their place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	And if you wish, work with the ankle which is involved with your hand: and it is that two bones, whose length is that of an arm, are placed beneath the head of the patient at the end of two toes: and two bones at the head of him at the end of two toes.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length be that which is between every two palms of the hand: and it is made in every place of the hole through which the [blood] flows, and it closes every wood in the earth much, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And the rounded wood is introduced: and the [ligament] is turned in the hole through which it returns between two holes of two woods.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its extremity is a hole in which the wood is closed, whose length is a palm with that which is turned: and in two other woods it is like this
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then string the ligaments which you bound in the chest of the patient around the turn which is at his head: and the ligaments which you bound in his thighs around the turn which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand at every turn of the minister who twists his hand with a bandage, with which the turn is turned: and the doctor equalizes the Spondile, as we have said
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turn which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then when the Spondile returns, and the place is equal, then it is necessary to put on an exicated plaster with albumin or oil
Deinde stuppam.	Then rest.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then put above the plaster a star made of a table, whose width is three fingers, or somewhat less
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the quantity which covers the place of the elbow, and over the sound part of the Spondile
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	And it is bound with the ligament which we mentioned before.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient should be fed with delicate food until he is healed
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If anything remains prominent in the place at the end of the healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines which soften and soothe, with the administration of the plaster as we have said in the long term
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And it is administered in that layer of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when an eminence appears at the last vertebra of the spine: it is thought to be a dislocation, and that is the bone which is now emining.</start_of_turn>
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not appropriate to make an assumption about it with this medicine: perhaps because of that it will cause death.</start_of_turn>
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	About the treatment of a dislocated ankle.</start_of_turn
Caput XXXII.	Chapter II.</start_of_turn
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You know that the dislocations of the ankle and the humerus do not happen except for a complete dislocation: neither do they happen except for a slight displacement and a concave curvature.</start_of_turn
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the dislocation of the ankle is divided into four parts.</start_of_turn
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it dislocates forward and backward.</start_of_turn
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And most of them displace inward: and little of them displace forward and backward.</start_of_turn
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its inward dislocation is thus: because when you join the sound limb with the diseased limb, it is longer: and the limb which is diseased is more prominent than the sound limb, and it cannot double up its foot beside the ankle: and the place which follows the ankle after the heel is called the heel-bone, because the head of the fibula lies there.</start_of_turn
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of its outward dislocation is that there are signs of its opposite on these signs.</start_of_turn
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of its forward dislocation is that it expands the sound limb according to its complement: but it does not double itself without pain in the knee: and if it attempts to walk, it cannot go beyond that forward: and it retains its urine, and its ankle is swollen, and there is a tingling sensation in the walk.</start_of_turn
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of it [dislocation] to which it has happened is that the knee does not expand and cannot duplicate itself before it has doubled the knee: and its thigh is also shorter on the other side: and the knee is softened, and the head of the coxae is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation is of the species which conserves the limb as a whole, if the dislocation is old, which has existed since its origin with the limb itself
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you perform the reduction of it, and it remains as before: then there is no healing in that at all
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	It is not right that a suspicion should be formed of it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that case in which the dislocation is fixed, and is of the species of the four dislocations: then it is proper for you to join them together, and to extend the limb inwards and outwards, and to move the limb from side to side: perhaps it will return by itself, and no other cure will be needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong minister, and to extend the thigh from the lower part: either with the hands or with a ligature which is tied above the knee: and another minister extends the hand above, so that it inserts the hand under the toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then tighten with a ligament loosely over the root of the coxae, and keep the extremity of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the extension be from the anterior part of the knee to the part of the ischium, or from the posterior part to the part of the back
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension be throughout in one way, until the patient lifts himself with his body from the earth, and remains hanging
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this is the common species of the four species of extension.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If, therefore, the displacement returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for every kind to perform that which I shall say concerning the proper care.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	When reduction has been performed within, the patient must rest on the sound side over the painful area
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then the ligament is placed over the root of the thigh, in that place where the head of the thigh is, and the place under the groin
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then the ligament is extended from the groin upwards to the upper part of the body, to the part of the breastbone.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong hand takes hold of the limb, and grasps the great toe of the lower limb, and extends it outwards to its full extent.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	And thus it returns to its place
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier than the rest of the methods for reducing this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, you are excused by him, and he does not obey your order with this method: then it is necessary to bind the two feet of the patient together with a strong, soft ligament, over the two heels and over the two knees: and let the length of each be equal to the quantity of four fingers: and let the limb be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	And the patient is suspended over the head of the limb: and let the length of it from the ground be equal to the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong youth to grasp the head of the thigh: and suspend him with the patient by another: and the youth will drive out the thigh with force, for the join will return to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	When the dislocation is external, the patient must lie upon a board as we have mentioned in the case of gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the ligament must be tied over the limb itself and over the abdomen
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two boards are placed, one under the feet and the other under the head of the limb itself.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	And a board is placed in the middle of the foot, fixed firmly: upon which are placed moist cloths, so that it does not cause pain to the patient: and let the board be between the thighs, so that it does not draw towards the lower parts at the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	And extend all the limbs to their proper place, and the physician should equal the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If this be done, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place upon the limb itself a board, and press upon it, as we said in the case of gibbosity, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	But it must be that the patient lies upon his sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is forward, then it must be that the limb of the patient be extended quickly: and this is according to the same narration as upon the board: and the physician puts his right hand upon the patient's knee
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	And then grasp it with the other hand, and with this coaction put it extended towards the lower part towards the knee
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is backward, then it must not be that the patient be extended downwards, but let him be elevated above the ground: indeed it must be that he be placed upon a hard object, as it must be that it be done even if the dislocation is wide towards the exterior, as we said concerning the recumbent position: and it is upon his face, and the ligaments are extended: according to what we said above
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	It is necessary that compression be administered with a board also above the place where the joint protrudes, when reduction is completed according to what is required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	The sign of its reduction is not hidden by the board: when you extend the two limbs of the patient, and when you have made them equal in length, and the patient tightens his limb and expands it without straining: then you know that the limb is returned according to what is required. Then join the two thighs together and apply a compress, and bind securely, that is, with a rotation, so that it does not move to any part: and the patient should rest quietly for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligament and the compress, and compare the limb with the other: when you find them equal in length, then you know that the dislocation is finally stabilized: absolutely so, the patient can walk again.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	If you see any softening: then reduce it again, and apply the compress once more, and bind it securely as before: and discharge it also after three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make it walk slowly on both sides for a few days, until it is comfortable again.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	(End of excerpt)
Caput XXXIII.	(End of Document
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, that is, posteriorly
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	It is not dislocated forwards
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	The sign of its dislocation is that the patient pulls his limb towards his thigh.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere to the thigh: then you know that the knee is dislocated
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all these displacements is that you should make the sick man sit with his right foot extended over his left foot, and that you should place his hand upon his face.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then adhere his hand to your palms and stretch his leg between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then place his hand with both palms against his side with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	The sign of recovery is that the leg adheres to the thigh gently, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then bandage it, and adhere the leg to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind it with three or four bands.
Deinde solue ea.	Then finish with it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And do not allow the patient to walk for a few days until he is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, he resists the reduction, then manage the extension strongly with bands, as was mentioned in the treatment of the ankle, until it returns.</start_of_turn>
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Regarding the treatment of ankle dislocation.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.</start_of_turn>
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus is sometimes dislocated with a small displacement, and sometimes with a greater displacement.</start_of_turn
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And the dislocation can occur either inwards or outwards.</start_of_turn
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that the calcaneus is swollen, proceeding to the part towards which it is displaced.</start_of_turn
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment for its removal is easy reduction: it is to extend easily with the hands and restore it, until it returns.</start_of_turn
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	When the rectum is dislocated according to the complement, it is necessary to make it sit upright: and keep the minister strong at the back of its dorsi, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Hold it with your right hand at its upper part and with your left hand at its lower part at the heel of the foot
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	And with your left hand support the two heels.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then stretch it out with your left hand, and push the heel of the foot with your right hand without straining
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the heel of the foot to the knee in the third part, and you draw the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it returns to its place once, or twice in this way, and you have equalized the foot, that is good: and if not, do the operation again over it: because it will return
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If, however, it is forbidden for you to reduce it as we have said: then make it lie on its back on the earth over the earth, and fix the heel firmly in the earth on the side, so that it rests between its thighs: and put your hand over it so that it does not cause pain to the patient
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then take hold of the hip: afterwards extend the other limb of the foot, or with your hands, or with the ligament which is over the ankle of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then extend all the limbs against the extension of each other: and the heel should be stable between the two thighs, holding it so that it does not draw the body downwards towards the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should equalize the dislocation with his hands, and the other limb should keep the knee of the sound limb towards the lower parts
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	The dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When the dislocation returns, and its soundness is declared: then apply an ointment and a compress, and bind it firmly with ligaments, and bind the limb with a ligament to the thigh.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	It is necessary to beware of nerves, which are above the heel behind, so that there is no tension on the ligaments over them, and that it does not damage them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, bind it: then loosen it on the third, or fourth day: and prevent the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he attempts to walk before that space of time, there will be no security that the dislocation will be dissolved and not cause corruption, and will not recover after that treatment
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If there should happen to him a soft swelling: then it is necessary, that you give him rest in that place in which our story proceeds elsewhere in the treatment, and embrocation, until it is moved out
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Regarding the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that it be equalized, that which is dislocated from the limb with little extension without work: and that indeed is not difficult, rather is easy
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If however the dislocation is in some part of the heel of the foot: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit down and rest his foot on the same level as the earth, or on a board: and he is as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then sit down, and place your foot on that which proceeds from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then let you support that with your foot until it returns, and keep it even, so that it does not appear in a prominent place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the foot a board that will embrace the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then heal it, and keep it still from walking for many days, until it is bound up and protected from reduction
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	As for the kinds of dislocations with wound or fracture
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter six.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When anything of this kind happens, and you know its cure and restoration, many things follow after: and for this reason it is not fitting to be proud of its cure, which is dangerous if you are not learned in the art of long practice, merciful, pious, prompt, not cowardly, nor presumptuous: and that you should submit to the judgment of the physicians who sit in the warm waiting-room.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you know, or expect salvation from the mercy of gentleness with regard to the pain, and in which something appears promising.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Attempt to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the case, before the swelling becomes cold.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If the limb returns, as we wish, then administer a regimen that will reduce the swelling: and care for the wound with the things that suit it from the drying unguents
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with fracture, and the bones are separated in the sitting position, then attempt to break them off, and do in that what we said in the ailments of simple fractures in the places of their fracture
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be careful according to your skill, and guard yourself from the entrance of fear: according to what has been said to you before
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	It is better for you to be pleasing to your Creator, and to persevere in his glory, and to have health for your body in this life.
