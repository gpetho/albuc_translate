On the reduction of the protrusion of the eye.
Chapter 20.
When the eye protrudes fully, and there is no damage to vision or decrease in it, then it is necessary to calm the patient, then bleed him, and next place cups on his neck without incisions, but with suction.
Then place a liniment on the eye made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Then compress the eye with multiple cloth pads over the poultice.
The method for the pads is this: take many soft cloths and fold each one in four; make many of them, then place them one on top of the other, according to the size needed for the eye; then press firmly over them with a strong, coarse cloth.
And repeat the cupping with suction, without incisions.
Then remove the cups, and leave the eye bound day and night.
If the bandage becomes loose again, then it must be tightened greatly; then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we have said.
If you see that the eye has now returned to the layer of the uvea, it is good; if not, then repeat the poultice, pads, compression, and cupping until it is healed.
