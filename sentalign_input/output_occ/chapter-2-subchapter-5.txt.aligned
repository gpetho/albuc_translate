On the treatment of tears from catarrh and those descending to the eyes from the inner parts of the head.	On the treatment of tears and defluxions in the eyes arising from within the head.	0.7826834
When someone has acute and continuous catarrh, and sometimes the patient's eyes are strained, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids ulcerated and losing their eyelashes, and there is sharp pain in the head and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the matter and catarrh come from many veins of the internal parts.	When anyone has a quantity of painful defluxions, acrid and continuous, and you see the eyes wasted and sunken and their sight is weakened and the eyelids are ulcerated and lose their eyelashes; while deep in the head there may be a vehement and grievous pain with incessant sneezing, then you may know from these occurrences that those humours and catarrhs arise from many deep blood-vessels.	0.83575994
And the best treatment for them is this: instruct the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, slightly across the width (and start with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be to the bone; and extend your hand away from the nerves of the temples which are damaged towards the chewing), until the bone is exposed.	The best treatment in this case is that which follows: you bid the patient shave his forehead; then you make one incision in the middle of his forehead or a little above, crosswise (begin the incision from the left temple going toward the right temple; the incision should be down to bone; and avoid the temporal muscles that move during mastication) until the bone is laid bare.	0.8857384
Dry all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth and then fill between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton or linen cloths. Then tighten above with powders soaked in wine and oil so that no hot abscess occurs.	Wipe away all the blood with a sponge and separate the edges of the incision with teased-out cotton wool or with rolls of linen; then bind up with pads over; the pads should be soaked in wine and oil to guard against an effusion.	0.7920078
And when you untie this and see that the abscess has already diminished, then rub the bone until flesh starts to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen that makes the flesh grow, as if you take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony and mix it, and make a plaster from it and apply it to these wounds until the flesh grows naturally.	When you undo it, if you see that an effusion has erupted, you should scrape the bone until a growth of flesh begins in it; then treat with a drying treatment which generates flesh. For example, two parts of wheat flour are taken and of colophonia four parts, and of them a salve is made which may be used to encourage the growth of flesh in wounds of this sort.	0.8198688
