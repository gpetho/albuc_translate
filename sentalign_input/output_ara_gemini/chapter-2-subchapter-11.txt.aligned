If extra eyelashes grow on the eyelid in an unnatural way under the natural eyelashes and persist, they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, relaxation of the eyelids, whiteness, and thickness, until this becomes a cause of blindness.	When superfluous lashes grow on the eyelid outside their natural place, below the natural lashes, and continue, they injure the eye and give rise to many kinds of disease, such as chronic lachrymation, dropping of the eyelids (ptosis), and whiteness and opacity, eventually resulting in the destruction of the eye.	0.8045801
Lifting the eye has four aspects: either by cauterization with fire, or with a sharp medicine as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization. Or the lifting can be done by cutting and stitching, or with reeds as I will mention.	The plastic operation on the eye is carried out in four ways: by the actual cautery; by caustic in the way mentioned above in the book on cauterization; by incision and suture; or with canes, as I shall describe.	0.74638355
Then you make an incision with the scalpel on the two lines that you marked, and start from the larger corner to the smaller corner, and one incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of the probe, then insert the hook into one of the corners of the skin, then peel it all off, then join the two edges by stitching with a needle and thin wool thread, and wipe the blood and stick the remaining threads on the eyebrows with some sticky substance if you want to do that, otherwise it doesn't matter.	Then with a scalpel incise over the two lines you have marked, beginning at the greater angle and going toward the lesser angle; and let one incision be close to the natural lashes, at a distance of about the breadth of a probe. Then introduce a hook into one angle of the skin and peel it all off; then join the edges with a needle and a fine woollen thread and wipe away the blood; and stick the ends of the threads to the eyebrow with adhesive, if you like; but if you do not it does not matter.	0.8972482
Then leave the stitching and the threads for about three or four days, then treat it.	Then let the suture and the threads remain for about three or four days, then dress.	0.91329634
If you wish, you can leave the wound without stitching and treat it with something that dries and constricts, for the eyelid will rise when the wound closes and joins, and stitching is better.	If you like, you may leave the wound without suture and treat it with drying medicaments and styptics; then the eyelid will be lifted as the wound heals and comes together; but suture is better.	0.79927313
This method of lifting was mentioned by the ancients, but it is a burden on the patient, although it is good work and there is no danger in it.	The Ancients mention this method of operating. It involves some burden for the patient; but the operation is good and safe.	0.8097495
And another method of lifting is to mark a shape on the eyelid like the shape of a myrtle leaf as we described, then lift the eyelid with three hooks that are either separate or joined in this way.	Yet another way of operating is to mark on the eyelid the figure of a myrtle leaf as we have described; then lift the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or joined thus.	0.8881042
Then you cut what remains of the eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting moderately.	Then cut away the superfluous lid with a small pair of scissors with an even incision.	0.69926214
If you cannot restrain the quivering and it does not settle for you, take a needle with thread in it and insert it in the middle of the figure, insert another thread near the larger corner, and a third thread near the smaller corner, and gather the threads between your fingers evenly, then raise your hand with it moderately and lift the marked skin entirely as we have described.	But if you cannot conveniently hold with the hooks, take a threaded needle and introduce it into the middle of the marking; and put another thread through near the greater canthus, and a third thread near the lesser canthus. With your fingers hold the threads evenly and then raise your hand evenly and you will raise up the whole of the marked skin as we have said.	0.87911105
Then bring the edges of the wound together by stitching and treat it until it heals; if a hot swelling appears at your cutting or incision, soothe that swelling with qayruti and similar soothing ointments.	Then bring the edges together with a suture and dress till healed. But if in your incision, or the opening you have made, a swelling arises, then allay the swelling with wax and similar sedatives.	0.78255093
It may also happen to the lower eyelid that its lashes turn inward, so it is necessary to use what we have mentioned of cutting, stitching, cauterizing with fire and with a sharp medicine, and cauterizing with fire or with a sharp medicine is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and stitching, and cutting and stitching are more effective.	Sometimes the lower lid also has the lashes inverted. For this you should use any of the methods we have mentioned: the incision and suture, and the operation by the actual cautery and by caustic. ( The operation by the actual cautery or caustic) is more effective, and easier on the patient, than incision and suture, (but incision and suture) is more workmanlike in either lid.	0.6817014
When it heals, the eyelid will be raised and the lashes will not prick the eye, and this is the picture of the two reeds, make it in this shape and this size in length and width precisely.	And when it is healed the eyelid will be raised and the lashes will no longer irritate the eye. Now this is the figure of the canes; you should prepare them exactly in this shape and of this length and breadth.	0.811043
