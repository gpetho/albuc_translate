 CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT.
On incising a tumour of the liver with the cautery.
 When there is an abscess in the liver and you are anxious to know if the tumour is in the body of the liver or in its capsule: if it is in the substance of the liver, the patient will be suffering from a feeling of heaviness and no very acute pain.
But if it is in the capsule of the liver there will be the sharpest intensity of pain and you will see that it has baffled the doctors.
Then the patient should lie back on his neck; then mark the place of the swelling with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire, this being the cautery resembling a probe, of this form, and with that make one cauterization till the whole thickness of the skin is burnt through, finishing up at the capsule so that all the purulent matter comes out.
Then apply the treatment for wounds.
This kind of cauterization should not be employed except by one who has a long experience of the medical art and who has frequent practice at dealing with this kind of disease.
Then he can undertake this kind of operation.
But in my opinion it would be better to pass it by.
