Know that this disease often comes to children at birth, and when the midwife squeezes the child's head too hard; and sometimes it comes from a hidden cause that is unknown.	This disease occurs most commonly in infants upon delivery when the midwife grasps the child's head roughly. It also sometimes happens from some hidden and unknown cause.	0.85315406
And I have never seen this disease except in children, and in all those I have seen death came quickly; and therefore it seems to me that it is better for me to abandon the work in such treatments.	I have never seen this disease except in very small children; and death very quickly overtook all those that I have seen; therefore I have preferred not to undertake operation in these cases.	0.88374686
If the fluid is more abundant, and the abscess is larger, make two incisions in the shape of a cross, according to this form:	This is the form of the scalpel. If the humidity is more copious and the swelling greater, make two intersecting incisions to this pattern.	0.67544675
And if the fluid is under the bone, and the sign that you see is the sutures of the head open on each side, and the water spurts out when you press it with your hand inside, and this is not hidden from you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this way:	But if the humidity is beneath the bone—and the sign of that is that you will see the sutures of the skull gaping on all sides, the water manifestly yielding when you press in with your fingers—you should make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this pattern.	0.77627397
And after the incision, draw out all the fluid. After, bind the incisions with cloths and powders, and put in wine and oil, and leave it thus until the fifth day; then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and keep the head evenly bound, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.	After incising, draw out all the humidity; then bind up the incisions with pads and bandages; and over the bandages foment with wine and oil till the fifth day. Then loose the bandage and dress the wound with lint and ointments. And do not forget to bandage the head lightly; and feed the patient with a dry diet with little fluid, until the part is strengthened and healed.	0.93531585
And another method of incision is that you look where the size of the abscess and the collection of fluid appears; for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.	Another pattern of incision is to see where the tumefaction and collection of fluid is apparent. For sometimes it is greater in the posterior or anterior part of the head, or to the right or to the left.	0.81137085
Then cut there where the abscess appears, and where the fluid is collected, and make the incision according to what you are able to do; and be careful not to cut the artery; lest a flow of blood come, so that the patient dies from the loss of blood and the evacuation of fluid.	Therefore make your incision where the tumefaction and dropsy are apparent; incise that place in whatever way you can. Be careful not to cut an artery lest you cause haemorrhage and the patient die of that haemorrhage at the same time that the humidity is evacuated.	0.86884844
