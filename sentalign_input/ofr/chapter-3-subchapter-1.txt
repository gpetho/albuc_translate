It is therefore necessary that we state in the prologue of this book the main points of the discussion and the chapters where the wise man applies his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or sprain or break occurs to someone, you must hasten to treat the patient on both sides, unless something prevents you entirely, such as weakness of the body, or infancy, or old age;
or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold, thin foods, that is to say, cold broths, and bird and venison meat, and do not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not overfill yourself with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you no longer fear a hot abscess, or the spreading of matter in the limb;
then the patient should return to their former diet that they were used to.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary to nourish the patient with foods that provide substantial nourishment, where there is viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow's tripe, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things.
For with such nourishment, the fracture repairs and heals more quickly.
And know that the broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot heal or knit well according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor can those that are too tender, like the bones of small children;
but have no fear, re-align the broken bone, apply a firm splint that supports and binds the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before;
and do not move it at all from its position, and for this reason it is necessary to nourish it with rich foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the chest, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another obliquely, like the cut of a quill for writing.
And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small crack.
And each type has its own technique and its own specific instrument for restoration, according to what is recalled in its place; 
and the fracture of the bone is recognized by the fact that the place is twisted, and appears clearly by default, and makes a sound when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel much pain, then there is no fracture;
but there may well be twisting, or a fissure, or a small fracture.
So you should not move it with your hand, but apply the medicines that come later, and then immediately bandage it carefully.
And know that for the fracture that goes across, and the two parts are separated, they must be immediately set evenly, before hot swelling comes there; 
and if hot swelling comes there, leave it for a few days, until the swelling subsides;
then set it evenly as best you can lightly and carefully, and know that its restoration is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces; 
then bandage it, as is appropriate below.
And if there are broken pieces in the bone, extend it from two sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken limb are separated, skillfully bring the additional pieces back to their places as best you can, and be careful that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and carefully join the two ends of the bones in the best possible alignment.
And feel it carefully with your hand if it seems to you that it is not right:
then straighten it gently, and do not constrict it too much, nor press it as those do who, through their work, cause a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is properly set, warn the patient carefully not to move it, neither while awake nor while sleeping, nor while turning, nor in any other way;
and ensure that the limb is so securely positioned that they feel no pain.
For when they feel no pain, it is not properly set, and it must be positioned in such a way that they feel no pain;
and take care that it is set straight, so that no crookedness develops when it is restored;
and the characteristics of the broken limb are as I have told you.
Know that broken limbs vary in smallness and largeness and in shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar:
so it is necessary to wrap soft and fine linen cloths;
and those that are large, such as the thigh and leg:
so it is necessary to wrap with a wide and strong bandage, for the wide bandage embraces the whole large limb, and constricts it evenly on all sides, so that there is no unevenness;
then tie around light padding, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little with the whole bandage, then go above the break and tighten less, as the break then moves away from the break a little;
and loosen the bandage little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and wrap it again over the broken place;
then go back to the part below the break, and tighten it moderately, not too tight nor too loose, as we have said in the first place above;
then put between the bandages linen padding or cloths, until it is all even, then tie a bandage over everything, and then put your well-made splints on, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, apply something soothing and warm to the abscess, which removes the swelling, and leave it like that for a few days;
then tighten your splints, and they should be wisely cut half the width of a large cane, or from wood which one makes roofing shingles, or from palm branches, and they should be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that is placed over the break be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and be as long as is necessary for the limb, small or large;
then tighten the splints as you did at the first binding, then tie over it a thread suitably, as in the first binding over the fracture;
narrower above, always less;
and the threads must be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bindings with twisted linen cords, and this is a great error, for the binding cannot be even if it is too tight, and there should not be less than a finger's width between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after tightening in healthy places, put linen wads, or carded wool, under them so that he is not hurt.
When the wound is with the fracture, and the heart is broken, I will discuss the treatment hereafter.
And know that it is not appropriate to bind all fractured limbs with splints on the first day.
For when the limb is large, splints should not be applied until after five or seven days, or more depending on your certainty of a hot abscess arising;
and see here the method of ancient plasters to restore fractures, dislocations, and sprains:
and you should take the flour that sticks to the walls of the mill, and mix it with plenty of eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common way of the plaster restoring the fracture in many cases, and especially in women and small children, because it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and sprain:
take three of abaris and labdanum and elecampane and asafetida and gum arabic and musk, each ten drams;
myrrh and aloes, each five drams;
mastic nine drams;
and make them into a powder, and mix them with egg white;
if the person's complexion is hot, then use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is beneficial for many people.
Another type of plaster that is good for sprains:
take mugwort and marshmallow, each ten drams;
myrrh and aloe, each nine drams;
acacia, six drams;
Armenian bole, ten drams, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply it.
Another kind of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and soothes the resulting pain, and the cut from the bone, and the break:
take new wool, and soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and put it on the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and cleanly removes the pains.
Another kind of plaster that restores broken bones:
take dried fig leaves, and ground ivy leaves, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another kind of plaster for the restoration of a bone fracture and to diminish the remains of the abscess.
Take marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, vetch flour, one part of each;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with coriander water, or with water, and use it.
Another kind of plaster, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes at the restoration of the limb.
Take marshmallow roots, and flax seed, pomegranate rind, melilot, and elderflower, and violet and chamomile flowers, equal parts of all;
and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
Hippocrates said in his book that one should not put on a broken limb to restore it anything but a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else more, and said that it should be between the two, neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on a broken limb, to restore it, somewhat warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloe and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain:
take mugwort and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and marshmallow, and salt equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and apply it.
And then unbind it a little later, and take care if the patient feels any pain, or if the bone has moved from its place;
if not, do not untie it for many days.
And if pain comes to the place, or itching, without rest or swelling, then hurry, and untie it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take a light cloth, and a moist sea sponge, and dip it in water, and wash the area, until the itching stops, and the pain is soothed;
then let the limb rest for an hour, then apply dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind it overnight, until you are sure of a warm abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb subsides, and the pain is removed, then begin again the fine binding, and a little of the plaster, and do not tighten it as much as before;
and continue gradually until it is healed.
And if you see that the warm abscess and redness and pain and swelling are completely gone, and you need plaster and bandage, then start again, just as you did the first time.
And if the limb does not experience any of what we have described, do not unbind it until after three or four or five or seven days;
and sometimes leave it for twenty days, depending on what one sees, until the fracture airs out, and the joining of the flesh above approaches;
then bind it more tightly than before, and increase his food, as I have said before; 
and if you see the place drying more than it should, know that nourishment cannot get there;
then moisten it with lukewarm water, every time you unbind it, and this should be every third day, and loosen the bandage a little; 
by this method, then, nourishment flows to the limb, and quickly corrects what foolish physicians do, who improperly set the limb:
this is bad, and also frightening work, and I see nothing else to do but to leave it alone and work on it correctly.
