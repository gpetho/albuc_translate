O, son, since I have completed for you this book, which is the culmination of the science of medicine, by its completion, its consequences, its explanations, and its clarifications, it seems to me fitting that I complete this treatise for you, which is a part of hand-operation, that is, surgery.
Because hand-operation is neglected in our region and in our time, almost entirely lacking, so that its science is greatly endangered, and its vestiges are lost; and nothing remains of it but some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which have been mostly altered and thus led to errors and hesitations, so that their intentions are obscured and their power and art are weakened.
And it seems fitting to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this treatise, according to the method of explanation, clarification, and abbreviation; and so that it may come with the forms of the cautery irons and of the other instruments of the work, as well as by the addition of explanation, and by its preparation, which is a necessary matter.
But the reason why a good craftsman with his hands is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and that its practitioner must first be exercised in the science of anatomy, which is very difficult, so that he knows the functions of the limbs and their forms, and their connection and separation; and has knowledge of the bones, the nerves and the ligaments, and their number, and their arrangement; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their emergence.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that in name it is much, but in practice little, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of this at the beginning of this book; for whoever is not learned in what we have said about anatomy, is not exempt from falling into error, by which men will die, just as I have seen many, for some are trained in this science and undertake it without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish and unskilled physician incise a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he incised some arteries of the neck, so that much blood flowed until the woman fell dead into his hands.
And I saw another physician who undertook to remove a stone from a man who was advanced in years, and the stone was large, and he came to him and extracted that stone with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and a black plaster cast was applied to a fractured thigh; and the physician, through his ignorance, extracted the fracture, over the wound, with cushions and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he unbound it according to his wishes, and then he bound it again, and then he left it for some days and ordered that we unbind the bandage; and it remained thus until the thigh and foot were suppurated, and it came to ruin.
And I was called to him, and I prepared to unbind the bandage, and tranquility was achieved, and thus a lessening of his pains.
But however, corruption was already confirmed in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and I did not cease to see the corruption spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who punctured a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated after a few days, until its malignancy was magnified by its master (i.e., the condition worsened significantly).
The reason is that since cancerous sores are full of melancholic humor, it is not appropriate to approach them with iron at all, but rather they should be treated by a member (a body part) that suffers in such a way that it is completely treated.
And for this reason, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation with the hand be divided into two parts: that is, into an operation which is associated with health, and into a procedure in which there is danger in the greatest cases.
And I have already explained this in every part of this book where an operation occurs that involves error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to observe this and avoid that, so that fools do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your instruments with diligence and with God's protection, and treat your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best method, by the grace of God, leading to health and laudable success, and avoid terrible diseases of difficult healing, and keep your instruments away from what makes you fear, so that hesitation in your faith and in your name does not overcome you: for it remains more for your glory, and higher in the world and behind your holiness.
Galen already said in some of his admonitions: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called a bad physician".
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter ordered from head to foot, on the forms of instruments and the tools of cautery, and on what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of suction and perforation, and of cupping glasses, and of wounds, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, of restoration and dislocation, and of the treatment of sprains and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and of the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary that I say the quality of the benefits of that cautery and its drawbacks, and in what constitution cautery is prohibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and its drawbacks is a long and prolix discourse, and subtle in science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they disagree about it, and a small part of their discourses suffices for me, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all complexions universally, whether with matter or without matter, except for two complexions, which are cold complexions without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is helpful for that, and others say the contrary, that cautery is not suitable in a disease which is by quality and by dryness, because the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a hot and dry disease should be healed with that which is hot and dry.
And I contradict those who say the contrary, that benefit is done by cautery in every hot and dry disease that comes in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of man and its humidities to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say, concerning this discourse, that experience has revealed this to me on several occasions.
However, it is not fitting that this should come upon someone who has already been exhausted and exercised in the chapter on cautery by prior practice, and has known the diversity of the complexions of men and the disposition of the diseases themselves, and the causes of those, and their accidents, and the span of time of those.
But in the other complexions, there is no fear for you, and especially in cold and humid diseases, for all the physicians are agreed upon those, and are not in disagreement about the benefit with cautery in those.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire and its goodness, over cautery with burning medicine, is because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member which is cauterized and does not harm the other member attached to it except with little harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches to those members which are distant from it, and very quickly causes in the member a disease of difficult healing and quickly kills.
But fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except insofar as it overflows. And it is already known to us by experiment and by length of service of study with the art concerning the truth of the causes; and for this reason I am excused from the length of the discourse. And if it were not that it is not fitting in my book to pause here to hide from you as a secret with fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies and its expulsion by which it expels diseases, with philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would be acute in your thoughts.
And know, sons, that they disagree about the time in which it is convenient to perform cautery, and they place the best time in springtime.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, because the harm caused by accidental time is submerged in the benefit of that which is achieved with cautery, and especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong and urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay because it is feared that those evils may come which are greater than the small harm coming from the time.
And this does not enter your thoughts, oh sons, this is only esteemed by the vulgar people and foolish physicians, that is, that for that illness which is healed by cautery there is no unsuitable time, and they posit that consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they think for that reason, because cautery is only in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause by which pains come.
But however, cautery is superfluous over medicine because of the swiftness of its effectiveness and virtue of its operation and the greatness of its lord (or master).
And it is possible that his illness returns at some time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his illness, and his strength, and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him, and that which has come to him in his acquisition in foods and similar causes; unless the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a limb with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth for pain and similar to that, it is possible that in him that pain does not return, but this is done in small things (or small cases).
And a more common saying is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and it is a righteous saying, not in the way they understand it, for they believe that it is not a cure that profits with medicine or with any other cause except cautery.
And the reason is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is only when we administer the methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help, and then at the end of the process, one administers cautery, and it benefits in that case. And therefore from here we understand that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and too many foolish physicians.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the preciousness of gold and the sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not scar, although this is not absolutely true, for I have already proven this and found that it does not do so except in some bodies but not others, and cautery with gold is good and better than with iron as they said; however, when you perform cautery with fire with gold, it is not clear to you, for it is consumed according to the quantity you desire due to the softness of the gold, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you apply fire to it, the gold melts from the fire, and some sheets fall into the fire, causing the artisan trouble due to this.
And for this reason, cautery with iron is done more easily and more appropriately for the correctness of the operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head to the feet, so that I may easily find what is requested from it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization combats the humidity and coldness affecting the brain, the accidents of which are two causes: that is, a cause of frequent and profuse rheumy flux, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and excessive sleepiness, and toothache and throat pain, and universally any illness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, sopor, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of this cauterization is this: first, order the patient to be evacuated with laxative medicine, purifying the head, for three or four nights, depending on the strength of the patient, their age, and their constitution.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then place him between your hands on a low bench and have him place his hands on his feet.
Then place the root of your palm against the brow above the root of the nose between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that spot, mark the place with a probe, and then ignite the olive-shaped cautery, of which this is the form:
Then place it on the spot marked with the probe, in such a way that it descends, with which your hand should be gradually tightened, and you rotate it.
Then lift your hand slightly and examine the area, and if you see any amount of the bone's head exposed, about the size of a grain of barley, then raise your hand, and if not, return your hand with that iron, or with another like it, if it is cooled, until that which I have told you is seen of the bone.
Then take a little salt and dissolve it on the area and leave it for three days.
Then place a cotton ball soaked in wine on it and leave it there until the burn scar is destroyed. Then treat the area with tetrafarmicon ointment until it is healed.
And it is said that when the wound remains open, it expels the pus better, because it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the bone marrow should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the bone's substance is hardened.
Then scrape away what is burnt from the bone, and then it should be treated.
And others say that with the cautery, one should reach the depth, until it first enters the bone strongly, so that the bone burns, and this is the form of a small alphecat (likely referring to a type of cauterization or lesion): And they believe that vapors from the head exhale from that place.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then it should be healed until it is consolidated.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery at all, except in some men, as a way of fear; and leave that, it seems to me, better is health when it is; because the head is weakened by the solution of its continuity, as we have testified in the other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a cold nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better, in my opinion; and use that, and with that work, achieve health.
Chapter Two.
Of the cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs in the whole head, and this is prolonged in the patient, and he uses leeches and cupping and head purges and plasters and poultices and cauteries and bandages and similar things, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery that we have described and none of these things benefits him, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and if it is not cold and finds great cold, then cauterize that with another cautery a little below the previous one. And then cauterize that above the horn of his head with a cautery until the scab is parted/separated. Incise the scab and let the bone be uncovered to the extent we have described, and cauterize that with a cautery in the rear part of the head in the place which is called the vas – and this is the place where a cupping glass is placed. And ease your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient thereby finds much greater pain, different from the pain of all other cauterizations of the head.
And I say this cautery in its place, because it is necessary that the cautery with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Chapter three.
Concerning the cauterization of a recent migraine.
When a sudden pain occurs in the head, or a spreading pain around the eye, let the head be evacuated with purifying medicines, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have described in the chapters on diseases; and if all this does not help, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and peel it and cut off its ends from both sides. Then incise the place of the pain in the temple with a lancet until a place is made under the skin, so that it is hidden.
Then bind it tightly with a compress to cause constriction, and leave it for three hours; and then untie it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then apply a cotton swab soaked in butter until the place becomes sore.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner: heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
and it is called a nail or peg, because its head is shaped like a nail, which has a certain curvature, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
And then place it on the area of pain, and hold your hand — so that the flesh beneath is not burned — and move the iron little by little, with speed.
And if the amount that is burned by the specific heat is about half, then lift your hand so that the artery underneath is not burned, so that no bleeding occurs.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place that on the area, and leave it for three days; and then apply cotton soaked in a poultice, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of the knife as with a cautery, and beware of cutting the artery in this, specifically,  not-old, migraine.  (The "not-old" likely refers to a recent onset migraine.)
Chapter four.
Chapter Four: On the cauterization of chronic migraine.
When you treat a migraine with what we have said in the previous treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment is not effective, and sometimes because of the illness, what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire is insufficient, then you should heat the cautery knife until it is white-hot,  then mark the location of the pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or about that; and place your hand for a moment and press it until you incise the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful of the continuation of the jaw, which is moved during mastication, and that the muscle not be injured and the nerve which serves it, and that a spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the care and caution regarding the flow of blood from the artery that is incised, because in its incision there is danger, especially for one who ignores what he is doing and is not studious and experienced; and abandons the operation at the beginning.
And I will come to the recollection of the management of accidental blood flow from the artery according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if you see that this illness is not alleviated by this cauterization and the patient's body is tolerable, cauterize that in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on the constriction of an artery with a cautery having two blades; this is a better and more appropriate cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5. On the cauterization of earaches.
When pain in the ear occurs due to cold and is treated with laxative remedies and with the other treatments which I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, and this is the one called *puncta*, of which this is the form:
And then apply the puncture, then the cauterization, and let it be moved around the whole ear as a wheel is turned, or in a circle around each part if the pain is in a particular part. Extend the cautery from the root of the ear little by little, after you have marked the area with a probe.
And if the cautery makes ten punctures in the whole ear, or whichever ear it is, then treat the area until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the cauterization of a cough.
A cough which is cured with cauterization is only of those types which come from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Avoid cauterization of the type of cough that originates from dryness or from a spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this type of cough with leeches and purgatives and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries:  one should be at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected area, because softening [or relief] only comes to the seemingly healthy part.
And the method of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery at the very tip of the superior ear, a little above the corner of the head, and another in the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the index finger, and keep your hand with the cautery there until half the thickness of a quill pen is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of small knife, the form of which is shown above/previously. However, it is more subtle to do it a little like this; and it is necessary to cut away a little of the superfluous thickness.
Then care for the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
On the cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you have treated it with what we have said and your treatment is ineffective and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize the patient with four cauteries: one on each of the temples of their head; and one in the middle of the head, as we have said; and one on the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as described above.
And it is also cauterized above the stomach; and it is further behind; and then let it be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
On cauterization for forgetfulness caused by phlegm.
So that large enemas and purifying pills for the brain are given to the patient at the beginning.
And then shave the patient's entire head and apply to their neck a plaster of cetre as described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply that several times, for that is a manner of cauterization. And do this according to the same order which I have already mentioned.
And therefore if he is healed by these means, it is good; and if not, then make for him three cauterizations on the back part of his head, which descend from the highest part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. And place between each cauterization the width of a finger, and then treat the cauterization with what has been prescribed.
But if you add [more medicine] and the patient tolerates it, then apply cauterization to the middle location; and if you want a stronger application, then cauterize on both sides (or temples).
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the cauterization be olive-shaped according to the form given before.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
As you proceed in the purification of the head with leeches and with what we have said; and then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on all the temples of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body to find that and the patient tolerates it and the illness is severe, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery until it is covered with sweat from the patient, and raise your hand. And then care for it until it is healed, and this should be an olive-oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is due to phlegm.
And therefore it is necessary that you purify his brain at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatment which we have described in the section when the patient is strong and can tolerate the purging of medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and masticatories that purify the brain, before that for many days, with improvement of the diet.
Then shave the head of the patient, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery on his occiput, and cauterize above each temple. And if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I have mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
On the cauterization of melancholia.
When the causes of melancholia are corrupt humors and a thick phlegm, then cauterize that with the cauteries which we have described in the treatment of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is a superfluity inclining towards melancholic humors, and the patient's body is humid, then give him to drink that which cleanses his brain, according to what has preceded in the division [of treatments].
Then shave the patient's head, and then make a decently-sized poultice for him, and apply that to the middle of his head.
And the patient should be seated upright and held firmly on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and it is most worthy to use old sheep's tallow. And heat that over the fire with a moderate temperature, which the said sufferer will feel when it is applied to him. Then pour that onto the middle of his head within the circle, and leave it there until it cools.
And do this to the patient once a week, along with his other treatment, until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize it, making small punctures according to the need, provided that you hold your hand with a cautery thus prepared: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply that cotton soaked in sheep's tallow or goose grease.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the cauterization of water descending into the eye.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that will purify his head, and keep it from all humidity.
And make him sweat in a bath for several days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on the two temples if the beginning of the flow of water is in both eyes, or on one side if the beginning of the water is in one eye.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are below the temples; and let the cauterizations be far apart in the width of the temples.
And beware of a flow of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see a flow of blood from it, stop it with some medicine, which is possible for you.
And I come with the wisdom that is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and the caution of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below the two bones with two cauteries placed separately.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old tears (likely referring to chronic sores or ulcers).
When the tears of the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest location of the head, and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that with the cautery which we recounted in the beginning chapter concerning water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle location of the head and with two cauteries in the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two bones. And if it requires additional treatment, then cauterize it in all the area of the corner of the eye above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal odor (or foul smell from the nose).
When you treat this with what we have said in the division and your treatment is not effective, then you prepare and give the patient decoctions to drink for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize it with a moderate-sized cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize that with a clove-shaped cautery, with two cauteries above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair.
And beware of the artery, that you do not burn it.
And of the clove-shaped cautery, this is the form.
Chapter 15.
Of the cautery of mollification of the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or by humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize that, above the two eyebrows a little, with two cauteries in each part, and let them be elongated from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand too much with the cautery, but only to the extent that a third part of the eyelid is hardened.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are turned inward and prick the eye.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward so that they prick the eye, cauterization in these cases is done in two ways, for cauterization is either done with fire or with a burning medicine.
If you cauterize it with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to shave his hairs as those who cleanse them do, until they are lengthened and evened; and if it pricks him near their roots, then you bind his eyes with a bandage so that he is not bothered until the hairs have grown.
Then, when they are grown and evened, place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with a probe, with a mark which is shaped like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
And then place lint soaked in egg white or in quince mucilage on the eye.
And then heat the cautery, of which this is the form.
And then cauterize over the figure that you have marked, little by little, in many times, until the surface of the skin which is like a myrtle leaf is burned, completely apparent.
And a sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs of it raised above the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it like that for three days, and then place a bandage over it until the scar is healed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some matter returns through the hairs near their origin and the eyelid is softened, then perform the cautery again on that area in the same way as you did initially.
But if the hairs are below the eyelid, then cauterize that area until it is raised to its natural position and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
But cauterize with a burning medicine; this means that you instruct the patient to pull the hairs until they are elongated and even, and then a leaf-shaped bandage of cloth is made, shaped like a myrtle leaf.
Then take known soap and quicklime, about one ounce of each, and mix those ingredients well, and do this quickly so that it does not get cold; and then spread this mixture onto the cloth which is shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place that over one or both eyes; and place under the eye a cotton pad soaked in egg white, and the patient's head should be in your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it gently, but do not move it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is like fire.
And when you perceive that he feels the burning, then release the medicine and rub it with your finger; when the burning ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then observe if you see that the eyelid is already raised, as if washed by cautery or incision, for then it is well; and if not, return to applying the medicine to the place where the medicine has not yet taken effect and does not darken until your work is even and the eye is contracted.
Then place cotton with a bandage over it until the scab from the cauterization is removed, and then treat it with healing ointment or with another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, during your operation, to watch with vigilant diligence that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid after a few days is softened and some of the hairs stick to the eye, then repeat your medicine on that part of the eyelid which is softened, exactly as you did at the beginning, and then cover it again until it is healed.
And this is the method for myrtle leaf (treatment).
And know that the eyes of men are diversified according to their size, and therefore your treatment should be adjusted accordingly.
And the way of rectitude will not be hidden from him who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is ineffective, then you must cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, and have a minister hold their head between your hands in such a way that their head is not moved or shaken.
And then place a pledget soaked in egg white or gum arabic on their eye.
And then heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's feather, at the end with which the cauterization is performed.
And if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other end. And if you wish, let it be hollow like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the corruption from it.
Then place a cautery, well ignited, upon it, and hold your hand a little below the cautery, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not stray or the patient is disturbed. Then place the cautery on the hailstone in the eye and cauterize it.  (Note:  "grays del huel" likely refers to a hailstone-like growth or lesion in the eye).
And so, if at the beginning your cautery penetrates to the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it thus for three days, and then apply a bandage over it with drying ointment until it is healed.
But if ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and scraped as is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula which some earlier [doctors] described:  Approach the location of the fistula and open it, and then place into that fissure a fine tube, which is shaped like this: And pour into it the quantity of one ounce of melted lead; and hold your hand with a [tool, possibly forceps] with good retention, and don't hurt the patient so that the melted lead does not reach his eye; and it is necessary that you place upon the patient's eye a compress soaked in egg white or water, because the lead will adhere to the place of the fistula and heal it with marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed by what we have said of the cautery and the treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a perforation of the nose and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose as it will come to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Of the cauterization of the fissure of the wells [likely referring to sores or ulcers].
Many times fissures occur on the lips, and most commonly on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat these fissures with what we have said in the divisions and your treatment is not effective, then ignite a small, knife-like cautery according to this form that is shown:
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then carefully place that instrument in those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat that with cerots until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops and then breaks, and then becomes chronic, and pus flows and a fistula is formed, and then you treat it and the treatment is not effective, then you should apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula, and then place that heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand there until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and then do this once or twice; and then treat it with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
And so if the wound is incised and heals, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to open the area and remove the corrupted bone as it will be described in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the cauterization of teeth and the softening of gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and it doesn't work, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be described later, in such a way that you place the small cup over the tooth and quickly introduce the heated cautery into it, and hold your hand there for a short time until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as needed.
And then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the loose tooth is fixed, the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Chapter 21.
On the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or worms in it, and you do not succeed in curing it with medicine, then cauterize it in one of two ways: either cauterize with a cow's horn [presumably a heated horn], or cauterize with fire.
Cauterization with a horn is done by taking a cow's horn and boiling it in a pot of iron. Then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiling horn, and apply it quickly to the aching tooth until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cotton in the aforementioned horn, and place that on the aching tooth, and place ignited iron on top of it until the iron reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is done by using a small tube of brass or iron, and ensure that there is some thickness in the center of it so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery to the desired shape, and apply it to the tooth, holding your hand there until the cautery cools; and do this several times because the pain will be reduced either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, for the application of that cautery, the patient fill his mouth with good wine and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cautery.
And cauterize with whichever extremity you wish, as is possible for you.
And this is the shape of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Concerning the cauterization of extrophuli (likely referring to a type of skin eruption or lesion).
When extrophuli are caused by phlegm and cold humors and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them mildly, then ignite the cautery, the shape of which is as follows: it has two open ends so that smoke escapes from one end of the cautery through the other end, and place this ignited cautery upon that abscess once, and again if needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and apply a cotton swab soaked in butter over it until what the fire has burned is softened.
And then treat it with ointment and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the cauterization of hoarseness and the constriction of the throat.
When humors gather in the pulmonary passage, and especially when this is accompanied by coldness of constitution, then the patient should be evacuated initially with laxative medicines, and then cauterize below the root of the throat in the constricted area.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor burn his windpipe, but only a little.
And cauterize that area with another cautery near the junction of the neck at his last vertebra. And let his cauterization be done with a nail, following the previous manner.
And then treat that with what has been prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold dampness, and the patient has no fever or consumption [tuberculosis] and the disease is chronic, then cauterize with two cauteries on the clavicle in the previously mentioned places, long and wide; and with another cauterization in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a nail according to the previous method.
And if you wish, your cauterization can be done by puncturing with the cautery that is called a puncture, the form of which precedes in the puncturing of earache.
And let the punctures be deep in those places; and then cure it with the same remedies that were used before until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs because cauterization is done with it:  with one application you can make three cauterizations according to this method:
Chapter 25.
Concerning the cauterization of the testicle, which is the head of the penis.
When the head of the penis is dislocated because of lubricous humors and is not fixed in the moment of its return from its dislocation until it is in the habit of returning, and then with a small movement it is dislocated again so that it swells, as we have testified, then first you must reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be turned on his back or on his healthy side; and then raise the scrotum which is in the inner part of the testicle to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated towards the inner parts.
And then heat the cautery which has two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the scrotum until it penetrates from one side to the other; and the figure of the cauterization will then be of four cauterized heads.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place over the cautery cooked porridge with salt, and then keep the patient calm, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a nail-shaped cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened, the humidity is removed, and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Concerning the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and numerous humors enter the stomach, exceeding its capacity and multiplying within it, and if you continue the methods of treatment and do not cure it, then the patient should lie on their back, extend their hands and legs, and then cauterize that area with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, the size of a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on either side of the cautery, so that a triangular figure of cautery is formed; and space them out so that they do not touch, which would cause putrefaction.
And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of a finger.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery in the shape of a circle according to this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized, puncturing it where the cautery is feared: and it is that you mark on the stomach points according to the quantity you want with a probe, and then cauterize those points; and then treat it with the previously mentioned treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On the cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain arises in the liver due to coldness, or humidity, or excessive flatulence, so that it is thrown out of its normal composition by superfluous egress, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it does not help, then it is necessary that the patient be supine on his back, and mark with a probe three cauteries according to this form and this same quantity on the liver under the hypochondria, where the body lies.
And let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of the finger, and let the cautery be according to the length of the right index finger.
And do not press too much with the cautery.
And if the quantity of what is burned is the amount of half the width of the little finger, and no more, and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him lie down, having already spread his legs, and raise his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these areas with a knife-shaped cautery, when you possess subtlety and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the width of the whole little finger be burned so that the whole body is burned and it reaches the intestines, because the little finger is small here; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When an ulcer or abscess develops in the liver and you want to know if that abscess is in the liver's flesh or in its tunic, then if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient experiences heaviness and dull pain.
And if it is in the liver's tunic, the pain is very sharp and sometimes even exhausts the doctors in its treatment.
Therefore, the patient should be turned onto their side; and then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then ignite the cautery, which is shaped like a rake, the form of which was shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until the entire area is burned, until it reaches the pus, until healthy matter emerges.
And then treat it with the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that this type of cauterization be used except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and in whose hands many illnesses have been treated; however, let someone with some experience be bold in this operation, but this one is better left to us.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that a cautery made from the roots of birthwort was effective against cold pleurisy in this manner: that you take a long, dry root of birthwort, as long as can be found, and of the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire, and cauterize with a cautery in the place that is between the continuation of the clavicle and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the chin, slightly leaning towards the part below the beard, and with two cauteries in the area that is between the fifth and sixth rib, leaning slightly towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and with another on the stomach; and with three cauteries on the back; and with one cautery in the place that is between the two shoulders; and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary to press your hand with the cautery, but let it be evident in the skillful operation.
And some ancients said that some men used an iron cautery shaped like a ray and heated it, and inserted it into the place that is between the ribs, until it reached the abscess and was purged of its sickness, just as we have said in the case of an abscess of the liver.
But this perforation with a cautery is not without danger, for one may easily cause death or a fistula in the area, which is incurable.
Chapter 30.
Concerning the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen with what we have said concerning treatment in the division and it does not improve, then cauterization is appropriate in three ways, all of which are correct. One of these is to make three or four cauteries in a line, according to the length of the spleen, following the shape of the cauteries for the liver, the shape of which has been previously described.
And let there be between each cautery the width of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as we described for the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the patient lie on their side.
And another way of cauterization is to ignite the cautery having two points, which we described in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the cautery which is at the location of the spleen where the patient's left side lies.
And let your elevation, with which you raise the cautery, be according to the length of the body, so that cauterizations are made according to the width of the body.
And then insert the two points, well-ignited, into that space so that with them you penetrate the cautery from the other side.
And then extract the cautery; and thus four cauterizations are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three points.
And then you care for the cautery after it has stopped shedding pus for many days, for this is more important than the other preceding causes in the healing process.
Chapter 31.
On the cauterization of a dropsical patient.
Cauterization is not used for dropsy, except in a certain specific instance.  (The "3" after "alcinte" is likely a scribal error or annotation and doesn't affect the meaning).
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment that we have described in the division and your treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize with four cauteries in a circle around the navel, and with one cautery over the stomach, and with another cautery over the liver, and with another cautery over the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and with another cautery over the stomach. And the depth of the cauterization should be approximately equal to the thickness of a finger.
And then leave the cauterization open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment after cauterization with what is necessary, for two intentions must be added to him, and his healing should be hastened with help.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its shape is described above; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, as its shape is described above.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the upper side of the foot, not in the space between the little toe and the ring finger; and raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; and then raise your hand, and do not entirely remove it, because the yellowish water will flow out.
The cautery is according to this form: Then make two cauterizations on both thighs, and on each thigh a cauterization should be made with the knife-like end of the cautery. And let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without dressing for a long time so that some water may drain from it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is cold and damp to the point that it weakens the virtues—that is, the digestive and retentive virtues which are in the stomach and intestines—and this is treated with methods of healing and does not improve, and sometimes the patient suffers needing cauterization to exhibit virtue, then cauterize that with a large cautery over his stomach as previously described in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and with four small cauteries in the circuit of the navel, with a thin, nail-like cautery; and with a cautery over the hypochondrium, above the large loins, or with two cauteries.
And if sometimes the humors are exuberant and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize that over the pubis and over the intestines, and quickly and strongly applying two cauteries over the stomach and near the groins, for this is a perfecting cure of benefit from which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When in their nature there are old hemorrhoids or one of thick, cold humors or corrupted humors, and they are treated with what we have said in the division and your treatment does not improve, then cauterize with three cauteries over the lower part of the coccyx, small and slightly triangular, and with a cautery above the navel, falling between two fingers.
And if you fear that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face inflamed, then cauterize that over the stomach with a large cautery as previously described; and with one cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on his spleen with a nail-like cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter 35.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula near its excision.
When you excise a fistula, then you ignite the cautery that resembles a ray (or, a spoke/rod). Then insert that ignited [cautery] into that excised fistula, and apply your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if the fistulas are numerous, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and then treat them with ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on a certain part, it is slower in healing.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36.  On the cauterization of fistulas that are naturally formed in the private parts.
When nature does not heal the area as we have described, and the patient is frightened by it, it should be treated with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has an old fistula in the private parts, and it is running with pus and corrupt humors, then what is most fitting is to probe it with a thin probe, and then ascertain the depth with the aforementioned probe.
Then ignite the cautery which is shaped like a ray (or, a pointed cautery). And then insert that ignited cautery into the fistula, according to the depth that the probe indicated.
And repeatedly apply the cautery until those corrupt tissues are burned, once or twice or three times, depending on your judgment of what is necessary.
And beware of burning nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or towards the intestine, then beware of all those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you believe it is not penetrating deeper.
And then care for the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the material has been excised from it, and it remains so for a long time, then you will know that it is completely cured.
And if the materials have not been removed, then know that it is penetrating or in the depths of the corrupted bone, or that it comes from those causes which will be recalled in their place (later in the text).
Chapter 37.
Concerning the cauterization of sores.
When in sores pain arises from cold or from great inflammation, and because of this the patient's body is weakened, then it is necessary to cauterize that sore with a cautery over each sore with a nail-shaped cautery, of which the preparation (or mention) was previously given.
And quickly cauterize again a little below, so that three linear cauterizations result, and then they will be more helpful in the healing.
Chapter 38.
Concerning the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that area in the lowest part above the bladder, where the pubic hairs begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side, and with another on the left.
And let the length of each cauterization be according to the size of the walnut; and cauterize that area with a cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a nail-shaped instrument, as is appropriate/customary.
Chapter 39.
Concerning the cauterization of the hand.
When cold and dampness affect the hand, and because of this conception is prevented, and her menses are corrupted, and their onset is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then it is necessary that the area be cauterized with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we have described in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the area below the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
Concerning the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
When mucous humors are poured into the area of the hip, and are the cause of its displacement, and a sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it bulges.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the part of their hip with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the circumference of the area as it is swollen, so that the area falls within the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the kind previously described for the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be done according to the size of the thickness of the whole leg; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the hip area, and it is caused by cold and dampness, the patient is treated with what we have said and do not disagree, and this is ancient practice; then you must purge the patient of thick humors with foul-smelling pills or with artificial or similar pills; and then cauterize it.
And the manner of cauterization in that case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
If according to two known methods, of which one is that you cauterize that area on the patient's hip with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make them of good depth. And let the space which is between each cautery be the amount of the thickness of a finger, whether the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes let the cautery be in the middle of the place, on the head of the hip, so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose form precedes in the cauterization of the hip dislocation, that is, let it be a continuous circle and burn the thickness of the whole hip joint.
And this is the method of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is adherent to the hip and is not extended to the thigh.
But if it is extended to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, on the place to which the patient points as being the location of the pain; and with one cautery on the groin, about four fingers slightly below the left side.
And if the cautery is knife-shaped, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the hip joint.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is extended to the area near the toes, then cauterize there where indicated with a cautery in three or four points, or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates the pain to be below the buttock towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife-shaped cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations that you do not burn the nerves or large arteries with the cautery, lest this cause harm or contracture to the patient.
And I have seen one and another of those who were cauterized on the ankle and burned deeply during cauterization, and the leg swelled until the tumor reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted. And then a strong case of diarrhea occurred, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each according to this manner.
And the wise men say concerning the cauterization of the ankle, concerning the cautery of which this is the manner: make a circle of iron resembling the half of a palm in circumference; and let the opening be according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less.
And within that circle let there be another third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of a hazelnut; and let those circles be open on two sides; and let the length of those iron pieces be a hazelnut or two hazelnuts, and make in those iron pieces decently prepared marks on the circles; and this is its form:
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then let it be placed on the part of the ankle, the patient lying on their side. Therefore cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave that for three days; then plaster it with a bandage and leave the wound open for many days; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Says Albucasis: Oh, son, of this type of cautery we have used little, because of the fear of its application, and because we have found few who dare to apply it.
But of the good cauteries to him who suffers them, and find with that the location of it.
But cauterize with adherent medicines such that you make two circles having perforated armour in which the point of the iron tool is inserted; the length of the walls in height should be two nuts or thereabouts.
And if the space which is between each is the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and let them be open below and above, and let them contain themselves between them according to this form:
Then place over the affected part of the hip, the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand upon the affected part of the hip; then take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and the quality of that should be with little fire little by little, and hold it for the quantity of an hour, and let the patient suffer the biting and burning of it—for this produces a burning sensation like that of fire—until the burning ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the warm water from the whole hip with fresh water.
Then leave it for three days and place a poultice on it until the blackness of the burn is softened, and leave it for some days, and pus will drain from it; this is the final treatment.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, apply to it a bath containing water, in the same way as it was done for the hip.
And this is the method of warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, equal parts of each, and crush them and put them in a new pot, the bottom of which is perforated with a small hole, according to the amount that will go into the ray (presumably a kind of instrument or container).
And place under the bottom of the pot another glazed pot, and pour over the alkali and quicklime fresh water which covers them by a finger's breadth; and then when you have compressed them with your hand with good compression, let the sharp water descend from it into the glazed pot below.
And then collect all that water, and pour it over fresh quicklime and alkali, for then it will be a very strong lye, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterizing other members, because it operates like fire.
And some medicines with which cauterization is also performed are:  honey, vinegar, and quicklime with soap, mixed together.
And Galen recounted an operation and cure from an ancient physician by which sciatic nerve and vein pain is cured, and he greatly praised it, saying it needed no other treatment, and that it is healed at once, as he recounted, for that man entered a bath and was immediately healed from it.
And it is so that fresh rue should be taken, and if fresh is not found, a fresh fig should be taken; and it should be well crushed with a little fat and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and bound on.
And it should be left on for three hours or until the patient feels relief from the burning.
Then put him in a bath, and when his body is reddened, expose him to the sun, for the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
But Dioscorides said that when the varicose vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it benefits him well; and the cautery should be applied in this manner: wool should be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the toes and the ankle.
Then take dried goat dung and burn it until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. Then repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of burning reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of embers (or glowing coals).
Chapter 42.
Of the cauterization of toothache.
Sometimes pain is in the teeth due to various causes, such as a blow or a percussion, or excessive evacuation, and causes similar to those, by infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cauterization is only suitable for that single type which is caused by the effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuation of the patient with purging pills and similar,  cauterizations should be made on the tooth where the pain is located, three lines according to its width, provided that you mark with ink, in each line, five cauterizations or more, according to the patient's tolerance and their constitution.
And the cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a nail-shaped cautery according to this form:
Chapter 43.
On cauterization at the beginning of a swelling/tumor.
This illness often happens to small children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it occurs in their limbs with elevation and movement.
And you find in the last vertebra of the back and neck that it already begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And so when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that with a cautery which is circular according to this form: so that the cautery takes in all parts of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the area around the vertebra with the pointed cautery two or three lines. And let the points be close to each other.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered in swelling caused by a spasm of the nerves.
Chapter 44.
On the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which are infused into each member of the body, then when pain comes in the feet, it is customary for doctors to call this gout properly.
And so, if gout caused by cold is treated with a method of cure and the pains are not alleviated, then cautery alleviates them.
And it is so that you cauterize that area for evacuation in the area around the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary that a puncture be made on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize that area on each knee with three or four cauteries on each side with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize that area and do not press your hand too hard with the cautery beforehand; it should only be around the thickness of a finger.
And if the pains ascend to both knees, then administer the cautery which we have mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called  *suagra* (likely a type of hand ailment), then puncture in the circular area of the wrists, as if winding around, puncture in those two lines.
And if the pain remains in the fingers, then puncture in the area of the wrists on each side and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pains reach the elbows or muscles in a few days, then cauterize them in every part of the affected area.
And do not neglect the patient's good regimen and reception of medicines, for if good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of fractures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines protrude before the scrotum, and this is beginning to happen, then you should order the patient to abstain from eating that day and to use emollient substances so that the rupture may subside from his belly.
Then hold the patient between your hands above his bottom, and command him to hold his breath until the scrotum or intestines are retracted.
Then return it with your fingers and gently reduce the rupture over the pubic bone, noting that the extremity should resemble a half-circle in the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is this:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not protrude.
And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion underneath; and let another servant be at their legs, and another at their feet, who holds their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and hold it there until you reach with it the bone of the penis within the middle of the perineum; and repeat this another time if you have not reached the bone on the first attempt.
And observe wisely the position of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn that intestine, lest death or other great harm come upon the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not complete.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small according to their size and measure.
Then care for the cauterized area for three days with a poultice until the burn scab is healed.
And afterwards treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the area and wound are sealed/healed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment according to the length of his treatment, which will cleanse his belly, and that the intestine does not protrude outwards during the effort of healing.
And then, when he wants to get up after forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days.
And let him be moderate in work, and in the repletion of food and drink, and in vehement voice, for when he uses this entire regimen of healing he will be completely healed.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the abdomen; and at the beginning, if you want them not to spread, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let that which is exuded from the cautery be like the third part of it; and then treat it with what we have said, and it is not unsuitable.
And some earlier authors said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape, since it is marked with a probe:
and a line is placed through the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a nail cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of torsion (or twisting).
When pain develops in some member due to a fall or percussion, and that pain persists for a long time and does not respond to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be adapted to each member according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the torsion and its pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for those pains to be pointed from one member to the next closest, so it is necessary to pursue them with a cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cautery, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
Therefore, if you wish to cauterize a leper, consider whether the leprosy is spreading and whether it can be cured by what we have said in the division, and if you do not leave it, and you fear that the corruption might affect the whole body and its entire constitution, then cauterize it on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second lower down, towards the forehead at the hairline; and two more above the ears (on the temples); and one behind, on the nape of the neck.
And finally, with the cautery, press your hand slightly inwards so that a small impression is made on the bone, and the scabs are dislodged, so that the exhalation of thick vapors is relieved; and cauterize the spleen as needed.
And if the leprosy is already widespread on the patient and manifestly apparent, then you must cauterize it with the cauteries we mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the vertebrae near the sacrum, and one on the sacrum, and with two on the hips, and one on each hip, and with two on the groins and one on each groin, and with two on the knees, and with two on the muscles (thighs?), and two on the ankles of his feet; and cauterize it on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of his feet, and on the wrists of his hands.
And be careful of the nerves that are on the heel, so as not to burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pubic bone and with another on the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more precisely you apply the cauteries, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as others do, because his body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as prescribed by the types of instruments.
Then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour mixed with honey and with other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness (or stupor).
When a limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you should cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. And afterwards, treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes a numbness affecting the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the back, is cauterized near the exit of the nerves which supply that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
But do not attempt this except one who is skilled in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves moving the whole body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of albaras, which is morphea.  (Note:  "Albaras" and "morphea" likely refer to a skin condition; a more precise modern medical term would be needed for a definitive translation).
When albaras is chronic and you do not apply any medicinal ointments to it, then cauterize it with a cautery iron a little, according to the size and nature of the affected area, until the whiteness and its discoloration are relieved, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of barley and lentils with rose oil and with arnagrosa leaves, and with pigeon blood or with ewe's blood, of each an equal part and all mixed together; and then apply a linen cloth over the area until it is healed. (Note: "arnagrosa" likely refers to a specific plant, the exact identification requires further botanical research).
Chapter 50.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer. (or a cancerous sore/growth)
When a cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around its circumference as it is swollen.
And the wise men say that it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery iron in the middle; but this has not been seen by me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated, and I have already seen this happen on several occasions.
And it is more proper that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 50.  (Assuming a standard Roman numeral system)
Concerning the cauterization of a swelling/tumor. (Adubilati likely refers to a type of swelling or tumor)
When a swelling is delayed in maturation, and this is due to the superfluity causing it, or due to the age of the patient, for he is old and decrepit, with little blood, or due to the time of year, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the swelling; then cauterize it around its circumference with many small, pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.
But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery of which this is the form: and place that in the middle of the swelling until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in that place which is lower down, so that the body of the arm may be relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the cauterization of a corrosive (or, a corroding sore/ulcer).
A corrosive is a corruption moving in the limb, which corrodes it as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosive in a place that suffers cauterization with fire, then you immediately cauterize with many small, and large nails, according to what is appropriate in the place where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it completely until you eradicate all the corrosion and no cause of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and place on the cauterized areas crushed sulfur mixed with oil until the scabs are all eradicated and all the corruption.
And then treat it with flesh-generating ointment.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh grows where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on what remains in the corrupted areas.
And corrosion is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine, for that serves in place of cautery. But however, cautery with fire is of more easily obtained benefit.
And I have already spoken of its treatment with sharp medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you have need of it.
Chapter 53.
Of the cauterization of nails and other similar things.
Many times there happens in the parts under the foot an illness which is called a nail, and it is a thick, inward-growing cause which hurts the foot; and cauterization in such cases is according to two methods, that is, cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is that you heat the concave cautery similar to a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size which contains the nail in its entirety, and should be of fine edges.
And then place that heated instrument upon the nail, and then move your hand with the cautery in a circle around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail. And leave it there for three days until it begins to shed pus. And then plaster it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it does not heal, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should apply cautery with water to those areas.  Take a small tube of bronze or iron or a vulture's quill, and place it over the nail; then pour a small quantity of hot water into the tube, and hold your hand, and you should move it with the pressure of your hand completely, and the edge of the tube should be pressed against the root of the nail, and the hot water will find its way to the root of the nail; and let the patient endure the bite of the hot water for a little while, about an hour, and then remove it, for the nail with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this to those, and then to the others, until you have treated all of those which are in the body.
And then treat those, once the roots of the nails are eradicated, with those ointments which generate flesh.
Chapter 54.
On the cauterization of tremor.
When someone suffers from tremor due to cold in the nerves, or from a fever of a cold cause, or from another similar cause, then you should cauterize that person with four or five cauteries on the spinal vertebrae, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, with an olive-shaped cautery.
And their tremor will subside, and hasten the healing of the cold illness.
Chapter 55.
On the cauterization of accidental swellings in the body.
When in the body there are swellings and pustules, which are formed from thick, corrupted matter; then at the beginning, as it appears, it should be cauterized on the head of the fistula with a thin cautery with myrtle wood, the end of which is ignited with fire; or with a long root of hellebore; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes a cautery is also applied at the beginning of its expulsion in this manner; and it is not believed, and the superfluity is broken up by making these, and it heals from these.
However, this should be done near evacuation with phlebotomy (bloodletting).
Chapter 56.
Chapter 56. On the cauterization of blood flow accidentally caused by an arrow wound.
Often, there is bleeding from an arrow wound that is incised near the wound, which flows outwards, or near the incision of abscesses or cautery of the limb, and similar things, and it is difficult to stop that.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then press with your hand on the opening of the arrow wound, and place your finger tightly on it many times until the flow of blood stops under your finger, and it does not come out.
Then put small and large olive-cauteries in the fire, many in number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
And then take one of them, small or large depending on the location and wound where the artery is broken, and apply it to that vein quickly after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery there until that blood is stopped and restrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your finger and remove the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from among those that are prepared in the fire, and do not cease to do this one after another until the blood is restrained.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that another harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to restrain that blood, especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction when it is not extracted, for when it is extracted the extremities are better cauterized and the blood is restrained, or that it be tied with thread or with a ligature by strong constriction, or that medicines be applied whose virtue is to restrain blood; and they should be tightened with a cushion with decent constriction.
But he who administers decent constriction with a ligature and with a stricture with cloths or by the application of burning substances and the like, does not confer it except late.
But if this happens to someone and the physician or medicine is not present, then gently open with the index finger over the opening of that vein as we have said, and attend to its strong compression until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and the finger is not removed from over the artery; and over the artery let it be sprinkled with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and consider what need there is of cautery or medicine.
Of incisions and perforations and cupping and of phlebotomy and of wounds and their similars.
We have already discussed in the first chapter every illness in which cautery with fire and with burning medicine is suitable, and its occasions and causes, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the one who seeks this will be aided, then concerning that which he will have asked.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that in this chapter is what is in the first chapter on cauterization, but in a less terrifying way. (or "...but more terrifying than in the first chapter on cauterization" depending on intended nuance of "terror")
And because it is necessary that there be great caution, for in the operations which are in this chapter, many times there is evacuation which is with blood, with which life is maintained, through the opening of a vein or incision upon an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or purification of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision of a stone, and the like. And with all of these are accompanied fear and trembling, and in most of them there is danger of death.
And I admonish you that this hesitation should not fall upon you, for sometimes it happens through your handling of men with many kinds of illnesses. And of them there is one who is angry with his illness and death is light for him, and this is because of the vehemence of what he finds in his illness, and because of the length of his illness, and with the illness is a fear which signifies death.
And of those there is one who gives you his possessions and says, you hoping for his health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to that which comes to you from him of whom this manner is; and let your caution be greater than covetousness and your greed; and do not presume anything about this except through certain knowledge which verifies this to you, and to which a laudable success may follow.
And use in the cure of all your patients prognostication and indication of him to whom health is restored, for in that is to you help in the acquisition of fame and memory, of praise and of glory.
O, sons, may God inspire in you his understanding and not withhold from you direction and protection, for this is in his hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that this which you ask for and of which you have need may be relieved for you.
Chapter one.
Of the treatment of the water which is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth and when the nurse constricts the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it happens for a hidden cause which is unknown.
But I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those whom I saw, death followed, and thus it is, in my view, a deadly affliction for them.
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always thus enlarged until he could no longer support himself because of the size of his head, and moreover, the humidity increased until he died.
And this humidity is either accumulated between the skull and the bone, or it is accumulated below the bone on the brain.
Because the operation in that case, if the humidity is between the skull and the bone and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure in the width, and let the length of the fissure be about two nuts so that the humidity flows out, and this is the form of the spatula:
And so if the humidity is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two fissures in this manner:
And if the humidity is below the bone, the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head opened on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress it with your hand on the inner parts, and this is not hidden from you. It is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:
and then extract all the humidity from the incision; and then tighten the fissures with cloths and cotton wool; and then apply a dressing of wine and oil until the fifth day, and then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food with little humidity until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water appear, because sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore aim with the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do it as best you can.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood, and the patient dies from that blood flow with evacuation of humidity.
Chapter Second.  (or Chapter 2)
When someone experiences cataracts or rheums in the eyes or feet, and this is chronic, and the cure is not achieved by medicines, then the last resort is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incise them, have the patient raise his head, and then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and then tighten the patient's neck with a cloth; and then observe where the vein pulsates; and the location of each, above the areas near the ears, is pressed, and thus they are hidden except in some men.
Then mark the artery with a probe, and then incise each one with a sharp lancet from each side, with an incision reaching to the bone, and this should be done along the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and sever it at the incisions above.
And let the length of the incision be about two finger-widths, because when a vein is incised, the blood exits with a pulsatile flow, which spurts out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure from the ear a space of three finger-widths, and then mark it with a probe, and make the incision to the bone.
And the amount of blood to be removed is about six ounces, and quickly remove more or less, and all this is according to the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then examine the wound, and if any cause of infection remains on the bone, then incise it so that a hot abscess does not develop.
Then bind the wound tightly with feathers and linen bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic migraine or sharp headaches, due to acrid humors and a certain quality in the tissues of the temples, or a severe and similar old ailment, and it is treated with medicinal remedies and this does not help, then we should attempt in these illnesses the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or their cauterization as we have shown.
And the method of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hairs which are on the temples; and attend to the artery appearing in the temple because it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden except in few men by the intensity of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the neck of the patient should be constricted with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or evaporate the area with warm water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery; and then pour oil on it and extract it to the superior parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics which are beneath it, from every part.
But if the artery is subtle, then wrap it with the end of the oncii (a surgical instrument), and then incise it in a portion according to the quantity by which its ends are elongated and contracted, and there will be no flow of blood, because if they are not incised, the blood will not rise at all.
And then evacuate from one to three ounces of blood.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or with cords at length, and do not allow putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound and the resulting flow of blood.
And then incise the superfluity which is between the two ligatures; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are incised, and it will be in place of that same work.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or is of a heated complexion; for cautery is among those things that help drying humors, and therefore it is better in this instance.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that you fill the place with old linen, and that powders are decently placed upon it, and then it should be cured with drying medicines causing the flesh to grow, and with bandages until it is healed.
And if, while you are operating another time, there is a flow of blood from the artery, then you must take care to restrain that blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the place of the wound, and pressing with your hand until the bleeding is stopped. And if none of those things are at your disposal, then place your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and it is constricted as needed.
And what is lighter in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and place each, very hot, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between the extremities is elongated, because they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. But however, if it has less sharpness than two knives, it is better, because if it is sharp like two knives close to each other, it will not cut the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since in those [cauteries] there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is held in them and the flesh is cut easily.
And this method is better in every respect and gentler.
And let the space which is between the two knives be the amount of the thickness of a finger.
Chapter four.
Concerning the treatment of sharp and acrid eye inflammations.
When there are acrid tears, and it is the inflammation of those veins which are on the outside of the head, and you do not find any cause for treatment in medicine, and sometimes the patient's face reddens and they feel a crawling sensation on their forehead as if it were ants crawling, and their eyes are strained, moist, so that the hairs around them are wet, and the eyelids are inflamed by the sharpness of the tears, the ancients used to employ this operation in the treatment of these things, and they called that treatment “spassa”.
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hairs which are on their forehead, and then incise three fissures in the forehead, equally spaced according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure reaches two fingers: one fissure should be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a little of the movement of the muscles which are in the lacrimal duct, and the third on the other side.
And be careful of the incision of the arteries which are on both sides, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both jawbones. And if the space of each incision is the amount of three adjusted fingers.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which to dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the shape of its incision: which is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Excoriate with that [tool/spatula] the entire area between the two incisions with the [surgical] knife which is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove that spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a curette, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that [curette] against the flesh attached to the bone, and its blunt edge inside the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But if the incision is continued to that part of the bone, then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, squeeze the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a pledget of old linen, and place on them powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and ensure that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day, untie the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm or tepid water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5: On the treatment of tears from cataracts and those descending into the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone experiences sharp and persistent cataracts, and the patient's eyes appear small and sunken, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and shedding skin, and there is acute, throbbing pain in the forehead and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the materials and cataracts come from many veins originating in the inner parts.
And the best cure in these cases is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then incise a fissure in the middle of the forehead, a small one in width (and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be between the bones; and lengthen your hand from the temples' lacerations which are bruised due to chewing), until the bone is uncovered.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth and then fill the space between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton or linen cloths. And then bind it above with powders soaked in wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And when you unbind it and see that the abscess has diminished, then it is necessary to rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, and then treat it with a drying regimen that causes the flesh to grow, such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and from them an emplaster is made and is applied to these wounds to assist in the birth of the flesh.
Chapter 6.
On the treatment of that which falls into the ears.
Every cause that falls into the ears is one of four types, for it is either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass, or it is from a plant such as a pea or bean, or it is a flowing substance such as water and sour wine and things like them, or some animal.
And therefore, when a stone falls into the ear or another similar cause of those things that do not adhere to or grow in the ear, and you expose the ear to the sun, and if you see the stone, then instill into it some violet oil or sesame oil, and then assist in its extraction, and induce sneezing with a potion, and block the nostrils before the onset of sneezing. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear upwards, for many times it is expelled by these means.
And if it is not expelled, then assist in its extraction with the instrument called a slender ear-picker, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the ear-picker, it is good; and if not, then assist in its extraction with a thin probe of little thickness.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by this, then make a small copper tube and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear and seal around the tube with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open but the tube. And then extract it with your breath with strong suction, for many times this has been accomplished as we have recounted.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a small amount of lit tinder or bird-lime, which is used to catch birds, and place it on the end of a thin rod, and then carefully wrap it around that properly positioned cotton. And then carefully insert that into the opening of the ear with ease, and then dry the ear of its moisture.
And so, if it is not expelled by all the means we have recounted, then you must consider cutting it out before it becomes a hot abscess or spasm.
And the manner of cutting it out is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract the blood according to the patient's strength, and then hold the ear between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear below its cartilage, in a well-prepared place. And let the incision be crescent-shaped until the stone is reached, and, when the stone is found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then close the incision immediately, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause lying in the ear is a growth of fat that is swollen, then administer its treatment and extraction; but if it does not yield to such treatment, then take fine spun thread according to this method: and use that to excise the growth that has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it on cotton swabs, and then extract it with tweezers or a thin instrument, or with an incision as we have said, for its extraction is thereby eased.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing initially, and fill their ear with some old cotton, and lie on the ear into which the water has entered, and if it is expelled by this, it is good; and if not, then take several smooth pebbles the length of a finger, and warm them a little in the fire, and the patient inserts one of them into the opening of their ear and hops on one foot on that side and strikes with another stone on the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And if the water is not expelled in this way, take some paper or a reed, and place one end of it in the ear and hold the other end to a fire until the majority of it is burned.
And then place another reed there and do this as many times as necessary until all the water is expelled, and extract it with a cannula as was said above of the stone extractor.
But in the extraction of a creature entering that ear, if it is small, like a louse or similar, cure it as we have said in the division; but if it is of large size, which appears to the sense of sight, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks, and the cause of this is easier than all other causes that befall the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you cure it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your cure does not work, then you should expose the ear to the sun.
And then, if some cause of the worms appears, extract it with forceps or with fine hooks; but if no cause appears, then take a cannula narrow below and wide above, of which this is the form: And insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and then suck with it with a strong suction, and do this many times, until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not obey you in this way, then you should plug and close the opening of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already proven in the cure of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion, with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear, be with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and flat above.
And let it be such that it pushes whatever is in the concavity of the cannula to the outside where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take a ray (possibly referring to a thin, possibly flexible instrument) and wrap its end decently with cotton, and then pour oil into the concavity of the ear, or juice of some herb, or whatever you want of these medicines into the cannula — and that is in the ear —, and then introduce the ray with cotton on top and press with your hand, with moderate compression, until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the ear and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what is poured into the ear should already be slightly warmed by fire. And be careful that the substance which you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the treatment of ear obstruction.
Sometimes children are born from their mothers' wombs with an imperforate (unopened) ear, and this also happens in some adults, an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or an outgrowth of flesh; and this obstruction sometimes occurs in the entrance of the ear canal, which prevents the outflow of earwax, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.
And that which occurs at the entrance, preventing the outflow, is in most cases difficult to cure.
And in the case where the outflow is possible, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and observe it. And then, if you see an apparent obstruction, open it with a fine spatula, of which this is the form:
If its end is narrow, with one side sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be two fingers wide so that it does not injure the ear.
And then, if the obstruction is due to flesh grown in the ear or its canal, then remove that with fine hooks and incise it vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is in the outer part of the ear, then take a thin reed and heat it slightly with fire, and then insert it into the ear canal.
And then, if you have felt an obstruction with what the patient easily finds, due to difficulty in hearing, force the obstruction out gently; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a linen cloth, according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take some wool, soak it in rose water, and pulverize it finely over it and use it; and if you see the ear is already abscessed, then you must remove the wool and replace it with other wool, which you will wrap in a cerate made with rose oil, until the abscess is completely healed; and then cure it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear, and use the other treatment which restricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
On the treatment of a stye which develops on the eyelids.
Styes which develop on the eyelids are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with forceps or with fingers, and incise them with a spatula at their roots, and then apply a dry poultice to the affected area.
But if pain with bleeding occurs, then cauterize them with a thin, lenticular cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains at their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often there develops in the eyelids of the eyes some condition which resembles a swelling in its firmness and hardness, and because of this swelling it is called [a swelling/tumor].
And it is an accumulation of thick humidity in the eyelid below and above.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider then if the swelling proceeds from something that appears on the eyelid and is spread to every part; and its cause is light.
Then make an incision on it in width, and then peel it off completely easily until it comes out, and then suspend it with hooks and excise it.
And if the swelling is large, then you adjust it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it because the ointment for it restores it and causes it to heal.
And if the swelling is leaning toward the inner parts of the eyelid beneath the inner surface, then evert the eyelid and suspend the swelling with hooks, unless you decide on incision, and press it on all sides, and if the eyelid is lengthened by incision, this does not harm in any way.
Then, after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with a healing agent until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of styes on the eyelid above the eye.
A stye is a swelling which is engendered in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and mostly in children, it irritates their eyes and causes them to have a watery discharge; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because tears flow from them.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and their lower eyelids, below the eyebrows, are moist,  the area is swollen, and an impending stye is apparent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the stye within.
And a certain manner of operation is this: the patient rests their head in your lap, and you place a cloth between you, and make a circle of the appropriate size to contain the stye from all sides, and place that upon it, and press with your fingers all around so that the stye is concentrated in the middle of the circle. Then, in the middle of that swelling, you make a small incision with a lancet, the cut being no larger than that made in bloodletting.
But in the beginning it is necessary that you incise only until you reach the stye, for in most cases the stye is discharged through the incision in the form of a white pus.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped around your fingers at the edges and roll it between your right and left hand until it is gone.
And be careful not to press too hard on the incision so that with the lancet you do not reach the eye and injure it.
But if the stye does not appear at the beginning of the incision, press gently on the incision until the stye is discharged; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in wine and vinegar and place them on the area and compress them with powders.
And some crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision so that it dries up the remaining moisture.
And then care for it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs at the site, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the methods of touching the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are growths beneath the natural hairs and they are inflamed, then these harm the eye and cause various illnesses, such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and membrane, until this causes destruction of the eye, which is called tactus (a touching or affliction) of the eye, and it is treated in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with a sharp medicine as before stated in the chapter on cautery; or the tactus is done by incision and suture; or by cannulas as I shall explain.
And therefore it is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned, it is good; and if not, insert a needle into that in which there is a pimple [or abscess] from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the pimple upwards, and this should be — near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow — near the hairs, and pull the pimple to the upper parts with the eyelid, and turn it with a ray [of light, perhaps implying a tool or method to properly expose the growth].
And then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid below the inflamed hairs with a small, sharp instrument from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller lacrimal gland; and then extract the pimple and place beneath the eyelid small pieces of cotton or cloth, and then sew up the eyelid with thread, and it should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be according to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, for this varies in people, for there are some who require that a large amount be incised from the eyelid according to the amount by which the eyelid is softened.
And then make [an incision] with the small instrument along the two lines which you have sewn, and begin from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller lacrimal gland. And if your incision is near the natural hairs,  like the thickness of a king's [hair/beard — implying something thick and noticeable].
And then place the lancet in one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape it all, and then join the two lips of the wound with glue or fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and apply what superfluously remains of the threads to the two eyebrows with some adhesive substance, if you wish to do so, and if not, do not worry.
And then leave the suture of the threads for three or four days, and then care for it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised by the sealing of the wound and its aggregation; but suture is better.  And therefore the ancients advised this.
However, let there be diligence on the part of the surgeon, and it is a good operation, and there should be no fear.
And there is another method of treatment, and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three separate and gathered lancets according to this form:
But if it is not possible to hold the lancets, and this is not suitable, then take a needle on which there is thread and place that in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and the second thread near the smaller lacrimal duct, and adjust the threads between your fingers with equality, and then with them, lifting your hand with equal elevation, raise the entire area that has been marked as we have recounted.
And then join the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with a plaster and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are inverted; then it is necessary that you use on it what we have said of incision; but suture in each case is more skillful.
To cauterize with canes is according to this method: and it is that you turn back the eyelid and incise the growth that is within, as I have recounted; and then skillfully make two small canes or splinters, whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid and whose width should be less than the width of the speculum. And you have already incised at the ends of each part, where you have the threads.
Then carefully add each [cane] with subtlety over what protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the canes to each part with a strong ligature, and leave it for some days, for the growth because of the binding will die and dry up and will rot until it falls off by itself.
But if it is delayed, then break it with forceps, and then care for the wound until it is healed.
Then, once it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of the two canes which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Chapter 12. Of the elevation of prickly hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough, and prickly hairs in the eyes, then the operation is that you take a fine needle, and place on it a fine silk or linen thread, and then you adjust its ends very subtly, so that neither one gets in the way. And let the length of the threads be about the length of a palm.
And then you prepare another short, fine thread underneath, and tie its ends if you wish.
And then have the patient place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is clearly seen, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the offending hair, carefully guiding it, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull it out above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair out and place it in a little container; and let the hairs be one, two, or three, and no more.
And then pull your hand with that until the hair is removed, along with the little container, from the eyelid, with the natural hair.
But if the little container is pulled and the hair is not removed, you will pull the little container to the lower parts with the thread which you have composed with that, until the little container is removed from the wound.
And observe that with the vision of the eye, for then you will remove the little container and the thread, and clean each (wound) and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is elevated with that, or you leave it until it is lengthened to a certain extent, and then you elevate it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of a stye which appears on the upper eyelid.
When a stye appears in the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor consolidation of a wound or incision or cautery, and it is called harelip, and this stye is either natural or accidental, and it is caused by the consolidation of a wound or incision or cautery, or by something similar poorly treated.
The method of operation is that you should incise that consolidation and separate its lips, and place between them a small piece of linen cloth, and bind them until they are healed.
And it is not advisable to treat it with remedies that dry or constrict; for if you do this, the stye will return worse than it was before.
Use on it remedies that soften, such as fenugreek, and bathe it with the water in which mallow and linseed are boiled, or with diachylon ointment, which should be liquefied with one of the oils, and dip the cloth in it, and treat it with that.
And the key to your treatment is that you ensure, by all means, that it does not consolidate in a different form than it was initially.
And this operation, which we have described, is only a rectification of the stye so that it does not return to its previous form.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which is formed on the lower eyelid.
This stye, which forms on the lower eyelid—which is truly called a stye—is of one kind natural, and another accidental.
But an accidental stye is caused by a wound, or by a cut, or by cautery, or by other similar things.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert that into the flesh, passing it from the left lachrymal duct to the right lachrymal duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and stitch it with the needle, and incise it with a broad spatula. And then if the shape of the eyelid returns to what it should be, it is good; but if not, take a ray [likely referring to a thin splint or similar instrument] and place it in the divided area, and with it reshape the eyelid, and sew the two fissures on the side of the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two fissures of the two angles of the incision, which you have made so that they meet, form an angle so that when they come together, their figure is formed.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda (Λ).
Then remove the flesh on that side by the amount that the sharp lower edge is, that which should be the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts and sew them with a wool thread; and then treat them with what we have said of emollient medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if it is excised by fissure, suture, or cautery, then you must make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid as previously described. Then separate [the wound] with a poultice between two lips as we have said.
In summary of the discourse on the treatment of an abscess, whether above or below, let the operation proceed as prepared in the manner of an abscess, and this is in the form of various types.
And the skilled artisan always prepares a device in every way possible so that he may restore the shape to its natural form, or near to it, and the patient according to what suits him in terms of the operation and instruments in the best conditions.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many men such that the upper eyelid is solidified to the white of the eye, and the ease of movement and its natural functions are prevented, then it is necessary that you insert the end of a probe under the eyelid and lift it, or stretch it with an unguent.
And then you incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharply pointed, but rather slightly blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and keep the spatula from injuring the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision gently scrape away that adhesion until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and the entire adhesion is healed.
And then you put salt water in the eye with which you wash it; or distill into it some honey dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with a small piece of linen, and place wool infused in egg white on the eye, and then on the third day use consolidative remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the fleshy eminence of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types, for it is either nervous, and resembles a hard, fine chip; or it is non-nervous, resembling a congealed white humidity, which when iron touches it, or it is forced to be removed with an instrument, is cut away and the instrument is not inserted into it.
And both types begin only from the main tear duct until it gradually covers the sight and prevents light and eye movement.
But the manner of operating in its incision is that the patient places his head in your lap, and then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with a slightly curved instrument and extend it towards the upper parts. And then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or ox hair, or cow hair, or something similar, or strong thread, or double the end of the needle little by little and insert it into the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it to the upper parts, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which covers the pupil. And thus you follow it with the hair into its back part.
And then you incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula or with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that through the incision of it, a continuous flow of tears does not occur.
And sometimes the nail, with the instrument alone extended, or with thread, as we have said, and then it should be scraped with a lion spatula, of which this is the form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and that a rupture occurs in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then, into the incision, put a little crushed salt or a powder made of  [likely a plant, needs more context for precise translation - perhaps "cinquefoil" or similar] and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it fixed with the instrument, then many times this type of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed as I have recounted in the section/chapter.
And if you wish to incise it, then you open the wound of the patient and take a thin lion spatula of cold iron sharpened according to this form: with subtlety/precision. And if you see that it is rarefied and is hidden and rooted in that place, then distill from your alembic onto the wound a powder made of [likely a plant, needs more context for precise translation - perhaps "cinquefoil" or similar] or with rose powder or with crushed salt, and cover the wound until the next day.
Then repeat the operation on it until all that is there is removed, unless conversely a hot abscess forms in the wound, for then you leave it and treat the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it reasonably until it is healed.
The eminence of the lachrymal flesh, if it is noticeable in the wound as a great harm, should be suspended with hooks; and incise it in one part, and do not extend the incision so that you do not cut the flow of tears.
And then distill rose and [likely a plant, needs more context for precise translation - perhaps "cinquefoil" or similar] powder into the lachrymal [gland/duct - needs more context] until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the incision of a carbuncle and that which is born of flesh joined in a wound.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh is grown, and it is overgrown until it covers the pupil, or approaches or presses upon the eyelids, and quickly compresses the eyelids to the outer parts and is similar to a balustrade rose [likely referring to a type of fleshy growth resembling a rose in appearance].
But the operation on him is that the patient places his head in your lap; and then open the eyes of that one and gather all that flesh with scissors convenient for this, and hold that with forceps or with tweezers; and then incise the flesh at the beginning until all is finished with the lancet, and be careful of the eye that you do not injure it during your operation.
And let your incision with which you incise those be with a spatula, which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which hair is collected, according to how the form of it comes to this chapter.
Then when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or instill into it red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place over the outside of the eye a cotton compress with egg white until it is assured of a hot abscess [or boil].
And if some cause of granulation remains and hot blood is seen, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and cure that abscess with what diminishes that abscess, and then iterate on that with the operation until it is healed, and similarly do with the fleshy excrescence which happens in the eye of this kind.
But however, you must avoid all treatment of the weak eye by natural or accidental means, working with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that that member is tolerating that operation.
Chapter XVIII.
Concerning the collection of pus in the eye.
Pus is a viscous blood which settles on the eye and prevents its proper functioning, and weakens the eye over a period of days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and has no other illness than pus; then you may collect that pus.
And it is that you command the patient to place their head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with an oncia or two, according to your judgment; and let that oncia be of subtle doubling according to this form:
Or two oncias gradually in one piece according to this form:
And then those veins should be collected with fine forceps, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those veins being removed from the eye and are retracted.
And beware that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is in the midday before the sun, and you are very firm in your operation, that you incise only those veins.
And when you have completed [the procedure], then you distil into the eye verdigris or vitriol so that with its acidity it corrodes what remains of the splinter.
But if this is not possible for you, collect everything at that time, and then you plaster everything with something that soothes his pain, and leave it for a few days until his pain is subsided and a hot abscess is avoided.
And then repeat on him according to the same manner until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Concerning the reduction of nasal dislocations.
When you treat a dislocation with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as narrated previously, and it is not healed, then do not  make incisions into it, but incise the abscess above its maturation, and extract all the moisture which is within it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
And then, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is named a rasping head, and it should be made of Indian iron, and its head should be round like a chisel, which should be pointed by filing or sharpened by subtle filing (as it is in the following form).
And place that [instrument] upon the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with drying and styptic substances.
Then, if the area is consolidated and good flesh has grown there and the body of the pus is excised and remains for forty days, and is not renewed and is not festering and no accident occurs there, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is nothing else to do but to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and according to this method: that is, you uncover the underlying bone with an iron or with a sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a trephine according to this form:
Let the end of the iron [trephine] be triangular, and its shaft be thin and tapered to the end, like this.
And then place that [trephine] on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and extend your hand a little from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the trephine until it penetrates the whole bone, and the patient will feel this because they will feel wind escaping when you have their hand.
Then restore the area with styptic, drying medicines as you have been taught.
Then, when the flesh has grown and the area has hardened, the matter which was flowing to the outer parts returns to the nose, and this is easier for the patient.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the reduction of the protrusion of the eye.
When the eye protrudes completely and there is no accompanying injury, impairment, or diminution, then you should leave the patient alone and observe him, and apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification and suction for good suction; and apply to the eye an ointment made of  catarrh medicine (or possibly a specific herb), aloe, enses (likely an herb or resin), and sarcocolla, and firmly attach the plaster to the eye with much powder.
And the manner of the powders is that you take many linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four layers; and make [a poultice] from these.
And then place those [cloths] one upon another according to the amount the eye requires. And then bind them tightly with a strong cloth with firm constriction; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if in the meantime the ligament is softened, then it should be bound very tightly.
And then remove the bandage at the end of the day and night, as we have said.
And if you see the eye has already been reduced [in swelling], it is good, and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders and the binding and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the incision of the eminence of the uvea tunic.  (Note: "uvea tunic" refers to the uvea, the vascular layer of the eye.)
When there is a rupture in the uvea tunic, and it is prominent and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is marred by it, and you wish to incise it, then the operation is as we have recounted: that you introduce the needle into the root of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, and then place another needle with double thread from the lacrimal side, and make that penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; and then incise the area of the double thread and lift with it the part of the uvea in the circle of the needle, and tightly bind that.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white and allow the thread with the uvea to remain.
And then treat the eye with that which comforts it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes gather from all sides with a circle of cloth the large, protruding eminence, and then pierce it with a thin spatula that reaches the pupil of the eye, and drain the albuginea (whitish) humor, and the eye will descend and enter immediately.
And then bind it tightly so that it may heal.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of alconati (likely referring to a specific ailment or injury;  further context would help refine the translation.  It might refer to a type of ulcer, eye condition, or something else entirely).
This illness that is called alconati is nothing but a swelling that is located in the eye, similar to descending water, but it is not that.
But the manner of working on it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, and then take his head in your hands on both sides and gently manipulate it until you see the swelling descend to the lower parts, and then it should be dried so that it does not descend, and the light should be obstructed, and the patient should see things as they are seen.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water (referring to the fluid associated with the swelling).
But if the descent of the swelling is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a fine spatula and use it on the pannicle, gently scraping under the juncture of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the crown (in the hollow space), until the swelling is expelled.
Then, when it is expelled, you instill warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have previously boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then it should be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of the descending water from the eye (or,  On the treatment of a watery eye).
We have already discussed the types of eye discharge in the division and which should be pierced with a surgical instrument, then that according to the health. (A more idiomatic translation might be: We have already described the types of eye discharge and which ones require treatment by perforation; the approach depends on the patient's overall health.)
Then you should make the patient sit between your hands on a chair and tie his/her healthy eye, holding it firmly.
Then place your left hand near the eyelid of his/her eye if the eye with the discharge is the left eye; or with your right hand if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is the left one; or with your left hand if the eye is the right one.
And then place the tip of the almond near the cornea, at the edge of the white of the eye, on the side of the tear duct, and then gently press the almond and roll your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached the empty space/cavity.
And it should be that the distance of the almond to the preon (likely referring to a specific anatomical point, possibly the pupil or a point near the pupil) is the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness (the iris), and that is the cornea of the eye; for you will see with that pupil through the clarity of the corneal tunic.
And then place the almond into the place where the water (likely referring to aqueous humor) is, and then you draw it down one time and then another, and then if the water descends immediately, then show the patient that on which he will see immediately, and the almond in his eye.
And then rest a little; then if the water has descended, then you remove it another time before the almond is ejected/removed.
And then when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond easily, and gently rotate it with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the water and with that wash the eye inside; and then place outside the eye cotton or tow or wool infused in rose oil and egg white and bind the eye with this.
But we and those of our time place on that broken surface egg white.
And if the almond does not obey you at the entry of the eye because of its hardness — for there are some men whose eye is very hard — then it is necessary that you take the extract which is called *alberid* (a likely corrupted or dialectal word, possibly referring to a specific plant or substance), of which this is the form:
Then perforate that joint with it, and do not thrust your hand into the hole, but only make a subtle passage for the almond.
And then introduce the almond as we have said.
And when your work is complete, prepare for the patient a darkened, quiet resting place where he may sleep on his back, and prohibit all movement.
And position him so that his body is aligned, and he does not turn his head to the right or left at all.
And let the bandage remain in place according to its disposition until the third day.
And then, unbind it in that dark room and expose the wound briefly, show him some things, and then re-apply the bandage by the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that you do this at the hour of the cures or immediately after the infusion. Having said this, you must avoid this, because the water might easily escape due to great and vehement movement/agitation.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you must unbind the wound before the seventh day, and treat it with something that will reduce the abscess.
Then you clean his wound and place a poultice on his face through which his vision will be guided,  keeping him in the dark room for some days.
And then let him be removed from that dark room gradually and  converse about the causes of his illness.
And know that in a cataract, the pupil is not exempt from vision sometimes, and then you should be bold about the operation.
And it has come to us from some of those who are in Artach (a place name), and some say that they make fire in Ayrac (another place name), a perforated pot, with which water is drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read this in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the kinds of poultices, so that he who is ignorant of them may know them:
And let them be made of bronze or iron properly, and let their extremities be with this triangular subtlety, the sharp extremity thus, as that is the form.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of rotten flesh in the nose.
When various fleshy growths are produced in the nose, some of which resemble a very small scorpion, or a polyp fish; and this illness is called polyp because it resembles that represented fish. And from it is cancerous flesh, scabrous, of dark color; and from it is that which is lion flesh, not of dark color.
Therefore, in the case of these fleshy growths that are not cancerous or fraudulent, you should make the patient sit between your hands and place them in the sun, and open their nostrils, and prick those growths with your fingernail. Then extract that to the outside, and then incise what you have grasped of that with a thin, sharp spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; if any part remains from which excision is possible, then scrape that with one of the subtle instruments easily until nothing remains. But if it bleeds profusely or forms a hot, malignant abscess, then you apply what is necessary; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you incise and cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped and all the cavities are removed.
Then let there be poured into the nose near the incision, strong wine and water or wine. But if the nose is open and a moisture proceeds from it into the palate, then know that it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is rotten flesh in the excess pus above the bones of the nostrils to which excision has not reached.
Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce a linen thread into it, to which some thickness is added, and tie knots in the thread, and place between each knot the quantity of a finger or less, and guide the patient and introduce one end of the thread into the nostrils with a rod or with another instrument which is possible for you.
And after this is done, let it draw its scent until it reaches the canals of the nostrils, and it is expelled through their throat, for many times children in schools do something similar to this action, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to do it.
And then place the two ends of the thread, one end protruding from the nose and the other remaining in the nose, and then administer sawdust of flesh with the knots that are on the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
And then extract the thread, and place near the nose, near the extraction of the blood, a poultice, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that is rotten of the flesh.
And finally, at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for some days until it is healed.
But if you need a more drying cure, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument, a head-purger, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make this of silver or brass, which should resemble a small open lamp, like a small bowl, and the spout similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the head-purging instrument should be flat and open;  it should have a handle at the back, with which you hold it when you heat the oil or water, or whatever you want of the juices and sucticable substances.
Chapter 25.
Of the boils in the extremities of the nose.
Many times a boil is formed at the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in a few days to the point that it is very difficult to treat.
And for this it is necessary that you incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it. And then place on the area either a cautery or a burning medicine which will stay in place.
But if its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is hardened, hard, dark colored, and insensitive; then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess; for many times he who incises this abscess suffers great harm from it.
And if the abscess is of a reddish hue and is not dark colored, and if incision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and treat the area with what dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Chapter 26. Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when their continuity is broken by a wound or similar injury.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, you should perform this operation cautiously, only on certain individuals.
Therefore, when such a thing happens to someone, consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; then you should approximate the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each is healed, then you must scrape away some of the apparent skin until blood appears. Then approximate the two lips with sutures and tighten them; on these, sprinkle dragon's blood and crushed egg shells, and place over the powder a piece of diachylon plaster, or some other consolidating plaster, and leave it bound for two or three days.  Then unbind it, change the plaster, and leave it until the stitches are naturally shed.  Finally, treat with ointment until healed.
But the manner of suturing is that you should close the solution of continuity either with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the abdomen, or close the solution of continuity with thread, as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things which enter between the two lips in the inner parts.
Many times there appear in men, in the inner parts of their lips, certain hard abscesses resembling goose grease, and some of these are smaller and some larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you should evert the lips and separate each of those hardnesses on all sides, and afterwards fill the place of excision with crushed sage until the bleeding is stopped, and afterwards let it be washed with sharp vinegar and the place be treated with something styptic until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of the flesh grown in the gums.
Often a growth appears on the gum, a fleshy excrescence which the ancients called an albulus; then it is necessary that you suspend it with a hook or hold it with forceps and incise it to its root, and allow the serum or blood to flow.
And afterwards place crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders on the area.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it, for after cauterization it will not return.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the treatment of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, rough, decayed, and sometimes blackened crusts are attached, and they become citrine or green, so that corruption spreads to the gum, and the teeth become decayed.
And therefore it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and rest his head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those crusts and things resembling sand appear, until nothing of them remains, and this removes the blackness, the greenness, and the others, until they are cleaned.
Therefore, if this which is in the beginning of the treatment is removed, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the treatment on those teeth on the following day, and the second, and the third, until it reaches the desired end.
And know that the teeth require many instruments of diverse forms and shapes, according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the instrument with which the tooth is scraped from the inner part is different from the instrument with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms, and these forms of instruments should be prepared by you, which you will see immediately:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
That you cure the tooth of its pain with all skill and delay its extraction, for there is no cause that supplants its sight when it is extracted, for it is a sublime substance, insomuch that its extraction is excused.
But if the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is diseased, for many times the pain deceives the patient and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and aching tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operation of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which tooth is diseased, and you know it well, then you should scarify around the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is loosened from the gum on all sides, and then remove it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, beginning little by little until it is completely removed.
And then apply strong, large forceps for good traction or strong support, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold him well and he does not move, and then pull the tooth out straight in such a way that you do not break it, nor cause the patient greater pain.
And then, if it is not dislodged, take one of those instruments and place it under the tooth on all sides with ease, and strengthen its removal in the way that was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is broken or decayed, then you should fill that hole with cloth and tighten it with the end of a thin rod so that it is not crushed at the time of your tightening on it with forceps.
And you should open carefully with scarification around all parts of the gum and be very careful not to break it and leave a part of it behind, and to return to the patient because the injury would be greater than the initial pain.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and boldness in their extraction, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great illnesses in men which are more difficult to cure, and the roots of their teeth remain, all or some of them, or they extract them with some bone from the jaw, as we have witnessed many times.
And afterwards, after its extraction, the mouth should be washed with warm wine or sour wine with salt.
And if bleeding ensues from this, as often happens, then crush some quantity of sage and sprinkle it on the wound, and if the sage is not effective, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and fine tongs with which the tooth is grasped at the beginning should be of long extremity, short and thick handle, so that they do not bend when you work with them.
And let them be, as I say, of thick handle so that when you squeeze with them they are not bent; [let them have] short extremities.
And let them be made of Indian iron, carefully made with straight extremities, and at the extremities of these let there be teeth, of which the ones interlock with the others and tighten by strong constriction; and sometimes the extremities of these have the shape of the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* (that is, a stork), and are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the eradication of teeth and the extraction of broken jaw bones.
When you must eradicate a tooth which is broken and some part remains, then you should place a soft poultice on the area for a day or two until the area is softened; and then introduce pincers or forceps, the extremities of which resemble the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* or stork, the shape of forceps:
The ends of them should be made inside like a file or rasp.
And if it does not yield to you easily with these forceps or pincers, then you should dig around the root and remove all the flesh and introduce the instrument which is called an *atali*, that is, a small lever, of which the form is this:
And let it have a short, somewhat thick end, and let it not be bent so that it is not broken.
Therefore, if by this the root is removed, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is of a triangular end in which there is some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and of a more subtle end.
And you are already aided with this instrument having two prongs, of which this is the form approximately as follows: and with other instruments which precede in tooth scraping; for it is easily done with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, and this is its form:
of a triangular, curved or short end, which should have some thickness, and not be bent so that it is not broken.
And know also that the instruments for loose teeth are similarly made to the other instruments.
But the wise and subtle artisan in the art, finds for himself according to what the operation and the diverse diseases signify to him; for there are diseases to which the ancients did not give or devise a proper instrument, because of the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth is broken or fractured, then it should be treated in its place with what is convenient to it from among the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of tooth roots, and help yourself with a splint, of which this is the form:
And let there be some gradual thickening in it, and let it be constricted or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is entirely set; and then restore the area with medicines suitable for this.
But if there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape away that rottenness and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of teeth that protrude above the others.
When teeth protrude, not following their natural course, their shape is flawed, and this is especially true for women, and especially for venerable old women; therefore you must consider: if a tooth is next to another tooth, and neither closure nor alignment is possible, then extract it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you should incise it with an instrument of which this is the form; and it is similar to a boar's tusk, and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp point.
And let your incision, with which you incise it, be done in several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other teeth are damaged.
And if the protruding tooth is amenable to filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of which this is the form:
And let the whole thing be of Indian iron, and very sharp; and let it have very fine points, like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days easily, so that no other tooth is damaged and broken. Then smooth it at the end, and scrape it with some rasps.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and injures the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and is filled so that the tongue is not injured nor the speech impaired.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and loosening from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats, and you have treated this with styptic medicines, and your treatment has not been effective, then so that they do not fall out, devise that they are strengthened with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and quickly powders after a few days, but gold is never changed.
And let the wire be of such fineness and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the manner of tying is that you take the wire and pass the doubled wire between two healthy teeth, and then let it grow with two twists of the wire between the damaged ones, or if one or many, until the wire reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving to the point where you began, and tighten with your hand gently and skillfully so that it is not damaged.
And let your tightening, with which you bind the wire around the roots of the teeth, be such that it does not loosen.
And then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and smooth those ends in each place with a file, and bend them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightly bound.
But if it is loosened or broken, tighten it or them with another wire in the same manner at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, thus showing these bound together:
And when it is done that one or two teeth return to their proper places, and are grown as we have recounted, and that they are damaged.
And this is only done by skillful and wise artisans.
And sometimes some material from cow bones is used, and it is shaped like a tooth, and is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and is fastened as we have said, and remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the incision of the ligament which is in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which is under the tongue, is sometimes natural, with which one is born, or accidental and occurs from a wound which has already healed.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, their head being in your lap; and raise their tongue, and then incise that nervous ligament according to its width until the tongue is freed from its constraint.
But if in that place there is any hardness or knot, and this is due to the consolidation of a wound, then you apply an ointment and incise it along its width until you have incised the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And be careful that no fissure is made in the bottom of the flesh and that you do not incise too deeply and cause a flow of blood.
And then wash the site of the incision with wine and water, or with cold water; and then place under the tongue a linen cloth; that is to say, a piece of cloth which the patient should keep under their tongue every night so that it does not consolidate again.
But if bleeding occurs, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a lancet-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess resembling a small tumor occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and it is quickly enlarged until it fills the mouth.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, sitting facing the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black in color, hard, and the patient feels no pain in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then you place the hook there, and incise it with a fine spatula, and incise it on all sides; and if blood flows during your operation, then you place crushed vitriol on it until the bleeding is stopped.
Then return to your work until you have completely removed it, until it is washed with sharp wine and salt; and treat it with the other appropriate cure until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36.  On the extraction of an abscess from both ears and from that which is located in the throat, and of other abscesses.
When a swelling occurs in the throat, these are glands that are gathered together like cotton, which protrude outwards and are called tonsils; when you treat them with what we have said in the previous section and it is not healed, then consider whether the abscess is hard, dark in color, and insensitive; if so, do not touch it with an instrument.
And if it is red and the root is thick, then do not touch it with an instrument because of the flow of blood; rather, let it mature, and then you will either extract it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white, soft, and its root is thin, then that is one which should be incised.
And the operation for it is that you consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has already matured completely or if it has diminished in any way; then make the patient sit before the sun, and his head should be in your lap, and open his mouth, and the assistant, holding between his hands, should press down the patient's tongue with a very fine instrument, of which this is the form:
And it should be made of silver or bronze, and should be as thin as a knife.
Then, as you press the tongue with this and the abscess is shown to you, and you observe it carefully, then take tweezers and place them in the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can. If you pull out something from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form:
If you pull out something from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it resembles forceps, however its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a spatula of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you have incised one side, incise the other in the same manner, and immediately after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, let him gargle with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and similar styptic substances until the flow of blood is restrained, and immediately treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two [near the ears], and incise those as I have said in the incision of the two sides equally.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess which had formed in her throat; this abscess was dark in color, with little feeling, which had already closed her throat, and the woman breathed with a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her food and drink of water, and she was near death if she had lasted another day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had formed two points, from which it was exiting through two openings.
Then I treated it with a fistula and placed an instrument in one of its openings, and pulled it, and a large portion was pulled out of it, and immediately I incised it from where I understood from the other opening, and immediately I opened its mouth, and I compressed its tongue, and immediately I placed the instrument in that abscess.
And immediately I excised a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore, the throat of that woman was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, and soon ate food; therefore, I did not cease to incise that abscess many times for a long time, and another abscess succeeded it, which I incised until it was eliminated.
Then I took a cautery and cauterized her throat; therefore, it stopped adding [more pus or infection]; and immediately I walked around and I did not know what God had done in that regard.
Chapter 37.
Concerning the incision of a uvula when it is abscessed.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is abscessed and elongated, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a bubo.
But when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not succeed, and you see that the abscess is already outside of it and is subtle, then it is necessary that you incise that which is aggregated round; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, of dark color or black, and there is no feeling in it, then you must delay the incision of it, because in that there is danger for the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner that I have described, of its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit and press their tongue with an instrument which preserves its shape and then place the lancet in the uvula, draw it downwards and incise it with one of the two instruments which are described in the incision of the tonsils.
And it is necessary that you do not incise more than what is adjusted to the natural limit without addition, for if you incise more, you will injure his speech.
And after the incision, use what we have recommended in the incision of the tonsils, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, it is necessary to use ingenuity in cauterizing him without fear, and the manner of cauterizing him is only with sharp water (likely referring to a caustic substance), and it is that you place the patient's head on your lap, and then press their tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned, and then take the water which we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with that live coal (likely a heated instrument), and apply it neither thickly nor thinly, and with that fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the shape:
Let the extremity of it be a concavity in which the medicine is placed, like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and let the patient lie on his side so that the saliva or mucus from his mouth flows away from the applied medicine, so that no substance descends from it onto his throat and harms him.
And then take your hand with the medicine, and press it on the uvula for the space of half an hour until you see it become blackened and dried by the action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and submerge the cotton in the medicine, and insert the spoon with the cotton into a tube so that the cotton adheres to that tube, and do this as many times as necessary until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it as it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
And if you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it, and after the cauterization wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in vinegar, and cleanse with it what remains around it from the medicine, and wash with cold water, and treat externally with an embrocation, and internally with gargles until it is healed.
And this method of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.
Sometimes the uvula is cured by a method more subtle than cautery or incision, for it is cured by fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile, and similar herbs, and mix all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them in sharp vinegar and boil; and let the pot be well sealed with appropriate lute, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hole, over which a concave instrument of brass should be placed, in this manner; it may be made of silver or brass.
And let the end [of the concave instrument] be inserted into the mouth of the patient so that the vapor may reach the uvula through the little tube, until the uvula is sufficiently fumigated.
And then repeat this many times until it is dry, and take care not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the development of an abscess, for it would aggravate the abscess too much, and you should not do that, but rather you must cauterize the visible part of the abscess.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a reed and fashion a hen's egg-shell at its end, so that the patient's mouth may be covered, for the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the extraction of thorns and that which adheres in the throat and of other causes.
Many times, a fish bone or some other thing adheres in the throat.
Then it is necessary that you extract that which is apparent of those things, upon which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument in front of the sun, so that that which is in the throat may be revealed to you.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, because very quickly the thing attached to the throat will be expelled by vomit; or that the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a bit of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge, and bind it strongly with gall, and then have the patient swallow it, because when it arrives at the place where the thorns are, they are extracted, then they are expelled. And moreover, take an eel and bind it with gall, and let it be inserted and gently extracted; or take a leek and gently insert it and gently remove it.
But if they are not expelled by those means which we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be a little thicker than a finger, and at its extremity let there be a concavity which you insert into his throat with ease.
And let him have his head raised up, and be careful not to touch his throat bone, so that it becomes loose and with that you push the bone or spine, or that the physician does that with his hand.
But however, it is better that the patient himself inserts it, because of his knowledge of the location of the attached cause, and pushes downwards, and pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity which is prepared for him until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of a leech attached to the throat.
When a leech is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and does not loosen its hold, then consider placing the patient's throat in the sun, after you have compressed his tongue with the instrument which we have recommended to you.
Then, if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with gentle, decent movements.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and detaches itself from the throat), and abstain the patient from water all that day.
Then take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth into it, and wash his mouth with it; and do not swallow any of it and stir the water occasionally with your hand, for the leech, as soon as it feels the water, will fall off.
But if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with cyme [likely refers to a type of herb or incense, possibly  *cymus* referring to a flower head] or with asafoetida, using the instrument that we recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall out.
And there is another method of operation in the fumigation of this, which is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole, and the end of the instrument is fitted into that hole; and then let it go above the fumigation; and let the patient put his mouth to the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will immediately fall off.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and eating salty things and garlic, and do not drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen it will be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is extracted from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps like this, except that it has some curvature in it: which is placed in the throat, and its end is similar to a stork's beak, which is hollow, in which there is a roughness of a file, so that, when it grasps something, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and on their incision.
Abscesses are of many species, of many manners, according to what is remembered of them, of each one in this book.
And they are diverse in perforation and incision in two ways, of which one is by the species of abscesses themselves; and because of what we understand of the humors.
And the second manner is according to the locations in which they occur in the body, for an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy location is different from an abscess occurring in a joint; and each of them has its own judgment for operation.
And moreover, of abscesses, there are some which it is necessary not to perforate except near the maturation of the pus within them or their completion.
There are other abscesses which should be opened when they are raw and not matured according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near the joints, because when an abscess is near a joint, its being is prolonged until that which is in its circumference can be removed, and very quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, wherefore a cause of contraction of that limb is made; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay its perforation until it is matured, you will harm the principal member; or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it even unmatured; and it is not necessary to perforate it raw, of uncompleted digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that its pus may not spread and be elongated to the inner parts of the anus, and a fistula be made, or that it be made in such a way that it may not be healed. Moreover, you must know the time of the perforation of the abscess, and this is when it is matured.
And know that it is matured when there is a lessening of the pain and the cessation of the fever, and also the diminution of the redness and of the throbbing, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know that the perforation should fall in the lowest place of the abscess and from where the pus comes, for the cure of the swelling.
And the perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and away from the tendons, the cords of the nerves, the arteries; and, finally, in all even places in which there is no reflection; for in those which are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better that you leave the perforation of it until its digestion is completed, as we have said; for if you perforate it before that, the pus is prolonged and much filth remains, and quickly its lips are hardened and its depth increased.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body, due to necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and in large abscesses a large and wide perforation, or many incisions, according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses in which it is necessary that the cone be hollowed out and incised, when it is made like bread and is made to the point of suppuration, such as those which happen in cases of buboes and swellings.
And some of those are incised with a three-angled incision; and others are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the armpits.
And some of them are those in which a round incision and a lunar incision are administered, and similar to those.
But that which is not like the aforementioned superficial abscesses, you must perforate it with a superficial or simply flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should perforate it and not worry about removing all the pus at once; having extracted a portion, then pack the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger portion, and do this many times gradually until it is all discharged.
And especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old person in decrepitude, because the animal spirit is often dissolved with the egress of the pus, and the patient dies very quickly, and you open them. (referring to the abscesses)
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and concerning your perforation in which you perforate these abscesses, you must clean the wounds and consider then if the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then you administer lint or old linen; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you must place a wick in each opening until they join together.
And if a part of the intestine is severed in the abscess or you have hollowed it out in the circumference, then you must fill it with old linen or thread made from linen cloth, as when you have drawn out splinters or roots, without moisture; and bind it up until the third day; and then treat it and cure it with the ointments that are necessary until it is healed.
But if you encounter a flow of blood during your operation, then you should apply cold water and sour wine in which you soak a linen cloth, and apply this over the place of the bleeding many times.
But if the flow of blood persists, then you must administer the regimen and treatment and powders which I have recounted in many places in this our book and division.
But if it is in winter, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you must mix powders in hot wine and oil, and apply those to the locations.
And if it is in summer, and the locations are fleshy, then you should apply powders mixed with water and oil or with wine and oil, and all this should be cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should open the abscess and cleanse it and administer to its treatment what is suitable for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally, but according to the way of distinction I have already said of each abscess in what manner is the way of its treatment by chapters individually.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which appear in the scalp.
In the scalp, small abscesses are found, and they are a species of nodes which contain tunics that are adherent to them; and their species are many.
And among them are some that contain a humidity similar to slime. And among them are some that contain a humidity similar to pus, and similar to them; and among them are those that are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, since the extraction of those does not cause contrary effects.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is suitable for this, which is called a probe, until you know what it contains.
For if what it contains is humidity, then incise it lengthwise with a superficial incision according to this form:
And begin the incision from line B to line G. Then, when the humidity is evacuated, you scrape out that skin which contained that humidity, and do not leave any of it at all, for many times it returns if some of it remains.
And then immerse a swab in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in salt water; and fill the wound with this and leave it there until the next day, for with this you corrode all that remains of that film/membrane.
And then repeat applying that swab with Egyptian ointment a second and third time if needed, until you are confident that there is nothing remaining of that membrane; then cure the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you incise it in this way: with an incision in the form of a cross, and insert forceps between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from every part, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane which contains it.
But if the arrowhead opposes you, then do what I recounted to you firstly.
And similarly treat a lithified abscess with incision and cure as we have told you; and incision on a lithified abscess is easier, because it has little blood and little humidity.
And sometimes some of these abscesses are in the head of some men, in which there is no humidity at all; the reason is that I incised an abscess in the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a dull, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if anyone were struck with it, it would hurt them.
But in other accidental abscesses in the head other than this, this is not the chapter, such as the abscesses that appear on the heads of children and behind the roots of the ears, but the incision of all these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation of those from the lowest part of them so that the body is relieved of the pus in the lowest parts.
And then treat those with what is appropriate for their cure.
Chapter 42.
Chapter 42. Of the incision of scrofulas which happen in the neck.
Often these abscesses happen in the neck and in the armpits and in the groin; and sometimes they happen in other parts of the body.
And those which happen in the neck, many are generated among themselves, and every scrofula of those is within its own proper tunic, and just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the species of these scrofulas are many, for some of them are stony, and some of them contain humidity, and some of them are malignant which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that which you see of good disposition to the touch, of which the color that is manifest is similar to the color of the flesh, and is softened in every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not deep, it is necessary that you incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from the line G to the line B, and scrape it from every part, and extend the lips of the flesh with hooks, or with many hooks if you have need of them, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is most important that the vein or nerve not be incised.
And let the spatula not be very sharp, so that it does not injure your hand with the incision, or that it disturbs the patient, and that you incise only what is necessary to incise; for if you incise a vein or artery and prohibit yourself from your operation, then place on the wound crushed vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess is reduced and the wound is softened and begins to be suppurated. When the blood is cut off.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire with your finger if there is any cause of other small scrophulas, then incise those and clean those.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, then it is necessary that you do not incise that scrofula at its root. Furthermore, it is necessary that you tie it with strong doubled thread and that you leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then take care of it.
And if you incise the whole scrofula, then you must adjust the two lips of the wound and suture it as soon as there is no remaining superfluity.
But if you see that there remains superfluity because of the size of the scrofula, you must then consider incising its root, and extract it, and administer suture and what has been said.
And for those scrofulas that contain humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation where the place of its maturation appears to you, and place the perforation so that it is the lowest part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer a perforation, perhaps with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound already cleansed, you cure it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the core of the abscess accidentally occurring in the throat.
The ancients described this incision in the core, and no one in our land has been seen to have performed it.
And this is the written account of the words of those (ancients).
But in men having a quinsy, the extraction of the core should be avoided, because it is not beneficial, since all the veins and major blood vessels of the patient are located there.
But in those who have abscesses located in the mouth, throat, or ears, when the illness is not in the throat (windpipe/trachea), it is necessary to use the incision of the core to avoid the damage that is done by perforation.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the core below three circles of the circles of the core, or four, with a small incision in width, in the area between two circles in quantity, so that the incision is in the soft tissue (muscle), not in the cartilage, and this location is suitable for the incision, because it is free of flesh and its blood vessels are far away.
And if the physician is timid, then he should extend the membrane of the throat with a hook, and then carefully split the membrane until he reaches the canal, but he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
And then incise the soft tissue as we have recommended; and the incision of the canal is indicated by the inflammation which comes from it, with that which is ruptured from it, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time has come in which perforation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound's membrane, and sew only that, without the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the discourse which we have recounted, the explanation is only that you see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the throat of the patient, and the patient has come close to death, and his breath is cut off, and some proceed to incise the epiglottis so that the patient may breathe over the place of the wound for some respiration, and be saved from death.
And for that reason I order the wound to be left open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed; and its malignancy is for three days; and then I order the wound to be sewn, and cure it until it is healed.
And this which I have seen with my own eyes, is that a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and incised with it a part of the windpipe, and I was called to her cure, and I found her groaning as one groans from being wounded, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood which had come out of the small wound.
Then I was assured that she had not incised a vein or artery, and wind was escaping from the wound, and I cured it until it was healed.
And nothing happened to the servant except hoarseness in her voice, and after a few days she returned to a better state of health.
And now I say that in the dissection of an epileptic there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Chapter 44. Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the throat externally, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess according to the complexion of the body, and is very common in women.
And it is of two kinds, for it is either natural or accidental.
And the natural kind is not possible to cure.
And the accidental kind is of two types, one resembling fatty nodes, and the other resembling an abscess which is caused by the knotting of an artery, and in this there is danger. And one should not presumptuously use iron on it except in the case of a small one. And you should probe and investigate it with your finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you incise it like the nodes, and extract it with what contains it from the skin and blister; and if not, then its entire nature should be investigated, and then treat the area with whatever is needed for healing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the incision of types of nodes.
There are many types of nodes, and I have already described all their types in the division (or classification).
And it is necessary that I recount thus the difference between a node and an ulcer, as it causes doubt.
Therefore I say that with an ulcer there is heat and fever and vehement pain until the boiling (inflammation) of the superfluity is sedated; and putrefaction is complete, then the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that  leonine [or lion-like]  cyphose which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a swelling and is made like a blister, whether larger or smaller, and they are of two types, for they are either greasy and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division (or classification).
Therefore it is necessary, when you arrive at the cure of a node, that you express that and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument which is called an intromes, according to how its form will appear in the chapter which is near this one.
And the manner of investigating abscesses and all nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you will revolve your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the core.
And then place your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess, and then extract the intromes and consider what has come out in its wake.
And if the flowing humidity, of whatever color it may be, is expelled, then you should incise it with a superficial incision as I have said in the case of other abscesses.
And if you find no humidity in the wake of the intromes, then know that it is fatty (or greasy).
And dry it out with an incision in the form of a cross, according to this form: Just as I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and remove the skin from all sides easily, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract that pus with the knot.
But if it is broken during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the pus, and this often happens, and then you extract it in pieces until nothing remains.
Because if anything remains, little or much, the knot (or swelling) will return accordingly.
And if you see that some small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and bind the wound tightly, and place over it a hot poultice, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if it is a large knot (or swelling), then you sew the two lips of it together and treat it with that which causes it to heal by granulation (or causes flesh to grow).
But if a pulsating swelling is present, or a non-pulsating one, then you cauterize and fill the area with crushed vitriol and leave it tightly bound for two or three days until the wound dries and the boiling of the blood subsides; and then return to incising what remains of the swelling.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary in incision and perforation.
Of these are the forms of the instruments, and there are three types: some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They should be made of iron, or steel, with appropriately rounded ends, so that they easily enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called probes, and one of them is called a berid (or similar sounding word - the meaning is unclear without more context).
And they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
The form of the large instrument, its form is:
The form of the medium instrument, its form is:
The form of the small instrument, its form is:
It is fitting that they be used for those abscesses, and discharges, and fistulas, and buboes, because among those are those from the bones and from other causes.
And they are made round, thick, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of gilded bronze, or of bronze, or of iron, or of silver. And the best are when they are made of gilded bronze.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are suitable for opening fistulas in the cavity of which are reflections, which should be reflected by their lightness with those reflections.
And they are of three kinds, for some of them are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its stricture.
Form of the large lead instrument:
Form of the medium lead instrument:
Form of the small lead instrument:
The forms of the hooks are of many kinds, for some of them are simple, which have only one curvature, and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium.
And of them there are hooked instruments, and they are of three kinds.
And of those there are hooks having two curvatures, and they are of three kinds.
And of them there are [hooks] having three curvatures, and they are of three kinds.
And all these are necessary in their place/situation.
Shape of a small simple hook, its form:
Shape of a large hook having two curves: Shape of a medium hook having two curves: Shape of a small hook having two curves:
Shape of a large hook having three curves:
Shape of a medium hook having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are incised and scraped, and there are three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The ends of those with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp, and they are not placed in such a way, except that help is given in the scraping of the nodes, the fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and by these means the patient is healed and finds a little tranquility through the cauterization which is found after the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the shapes of the cauteries, and there are three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of bronze and are similar in shape to a ray, with which alcohol is made.  (Note:  The "ray" here is likely referring to a shape, not the marine animal. The meaning of the last phrase might be ambiguous, possibly referring to the cautery's use in a process related to alcohol production or simply a comparison to the shape of an alembic used for distillation)
And it is at the pointed end, hidden with a sheath, and in that way it reaches the inner and outer parts, when you wish, as you see.
The shapes of the sheaths, which are hidden among the fingers below the perforation of abscesses, and the patients do not perceive them, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those (instruments/sheaths):
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is stopped, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They should be made of bronze or copper, round with some length, and they should be thin.
And it is necessary that you have these types of cupping glasses: large, medium, and small, so that with them you can stop the flow of blood quickly when necessary, and then when it is not first necessary for medicine (i.e., as a primary treatment).
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body, and use them only in fleshy places, such as in the fleshy parts of the legs and thighs, and in the fleshy parts of the arms, and of the breasts and belly and shoulders, and similar to those fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes other small instruments similar to small [or narrow] pouches are made according to this shape; by means of which blood is drawn when it is done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or by bloodletting.
And sometimes they are made round according to this shape:
Chapter 47.
Concerning the care of the breasts of men which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are inflamed due to the habit of sleeping, as they begin to become hairy, and then the breasts are inflamed, and resemble the breasts of women, and remain as purulent, festering sores.
And to one who has this, it is necessary that he incise those with a lunate incision, according to this shape, from line B to line G, and then scrape away all the thickness, and then fill the wound with incarnative medicine, and then join the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat that until it is healed.
But if the breast sags downwards and is softened by its size as happens in women, then let it be cut into two halves at its most prominent point, with two incisions resembling a lunar shape, each contained within the other by the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from line B and line G. And then scrape the thickened skin which is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about the suture and powders that are necessary in the healing until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what needs to be incised because of the patient's restlessness and bleeding, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the perforation of abscesses that appear under the armpit.
These abscesses that appear under the armpit are a type of scrofula, hard, containing a sac-like skin.
And some of those contain humidity; and those that contain humidity should be incised with a lunar incision according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then you fill it with old linen and leave it there until the next day.
And then the linen should be removed and it should be treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes and of scrofula, then you incise it as we have said in the section on scrofula above.
But if the wound is extensive so that it produces pus, then administer cautery to it as we have said before.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur from an arrow or a vein.
When an artery is broken, and the flesh that is over it is consolidated, then often an abscess occurs. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are due to an artery or a vein: for when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long and aggregated in the front of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel in it as if it were a creaking sound.
And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision of this abscess is an error, especially in that which is below the armpits, and in the groins, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large, therefore its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is in the extremities, or on the head, should be avoided.
But concerning that which is there due to inflammation of the opening of the arrow wound, make a long incision in the flesh; and then widen the incision with hooks and near the arrow, and free it from the tunics until it is uncovered.
And then place a needle on it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tighten the arrow with double thread in two places — which method I have shown you in the extraction of two arrows which are in the temples.
And then puncture the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood which is there comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment in which pus is generated until the ligaments fall away; and then treat that with ointments suitable for this until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess due to a severed vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand that which is possible of the abscess with the flesh, and then insert the needle below the place which you have held under your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be double thread in it so that you extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with good thread as I have told you in the treatment of a grape-sized [abscess] in two parts with two ends of the thread.  (The "uva4" likely refers to a size comparison – perhaps a small cluster of four grapes, or just generally small).
But if you fear that it will pull out the thread, then insert the thread with that needle below the whole abscess below the incision of the first needle, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in its middle so that when that which is in it has come out, then you incise the superfluous flesh, and leave that which is tied in it.
And then place on it a powder which you have submerged in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is done with poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess which happens because of a twisted nerve.
Just as an abscess happens in an artery and in a vein, similarly an abscess happens in the nerves when it happens in their percussion or happens because of excessive work, and similarly.
And it is made worse in the places of the joints or of the heel, or in any place where the joints are weakened.
And the abscess is serious, and it resembles the color of the other body parts, and it is in the worst dispositions of them and when it is squeezed with force, the patient feels a similar stupor.
And the abscess is not located in the front of the body, and therefore it is below the ribs, and it is weakened in every part and does not go to the front or back parts.
Therefore, that which is in the joints should not be invaded with iron, for contraction will very quickly result.
But that which is in the head or on the forehead, finish [treat] it with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then take it with forceps and excise it from the root.
And if it is large, then you suspend it with a hook, and incise it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
Of the incision of an abscess which happens to the one which happens in the belly.  (More literally: Of the incision of an abscess which happens from that which happens to the belly.)
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies,  growths which are called fungals by similarity to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and their lips are sometimes inverted, and some are small, and some are very large.
And I have seen one, and in his belly were two growths which were very similar to fungi, and there was no difference between them, white, with a thin root.
And their lips were inverted and split, and humidity flowed from them constantly.
Therefore I incised them and found in one a weight of eighteen ounces, and in the other six ounces.
And the operation in their incision is that you consider then if the patient is humid, and the color of the growth is white, humid, with a subtle root; then you incise it with a broad spatula, and let cauteries be in your presence in the fire, because many times after the section of it much blood is expelled; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and timid, guard yourself from incision with iron; but then take freshly made lead plaster, and bind the growth with it, in the manner which we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease tightening the lead strongly around the growth, until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort.
But if the growth is of thick root, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and dread, and especially that which is in the belly.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And then care for it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to incise a growth which is of dark color, little feeling, and thin appearance, for that is likely cancerous.
And I come to the remembrance of cancer concerning this.
Chapter 52.
On the treatment of umbilical hernia.
Umbilical hernia is caused by many things; either by fissures of the diaphragm which is above the belly, and from it the membrane or intestine protrudes as it does in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned; or by constricted wind within it.
But if it is due to a fissure of the diaphragm and a protrusion of the membrane, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain, and it appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is as we have recounted, of even greater variability, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and quickly returns; and it is very easily replaced, and is greatly increased by the entry of a bath and strenuous exertion.
But if it is due to humidity, then it is soft and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it grow.
And if it is due to blood, then the swelling appears with these signs, tending towards blackness.
But if it is due to rotten flesh, then the swelling is serious, large and hard, and is fixed in a certain place.
But if it is due to flatulence, then touching it feels soft.
And the operation on it is that you consider then if the swelling of the umbilicus is from arterial blood, or from a vein, or from flatulence; then it is necessary that you abstain from its treatment, because in that there is fear and dread, as I have taught you in the chapter in which I have described swellings from an artery and from a vein.
And if the swelling of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or the membrane, then you must order the patient to hold their breath and lie down; and then mark with a probe the circumference of the entire umbilicus, and then order him to lie between your hands on his back, and then surround with a broad spatula the circumference of the umbilicus over the area that you have marked with the probe; and then extend half of the swelling upwards with a large finger; and then tie it around with strong thread or with linen, tying it properly.
And then open the middle of the extended swelling over the ligature and insert your finger into that opening and look for the intestine; and if you have found it and held it by the ligature, then you carefully extract and push the intestine back into the abdomen.
And if you have found the membrane, then grasp it with a finger; and cut away its excesses.
But if it is an artery or vein, then surround that area, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and thread strong threads into them and insert the two needles into the circle which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, making them penetrate; and then tighten the swelling in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the extended flesh dries and falls off by itself; or cut it away when it is thinned and dried, and then treat it with whatever ointments are appropriate until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the umbilicus is from flesh growing there or from moisture, then it is necessary that you incise the swelling as we have said and extract the blood or moisture which you find there, and then treat it with what is appropriate and what will consolidate the area.
Chapter 53.
Concerning the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed, in the division [of the text/subject], the types of cancer and in what manner it is possible to treat it with medicines, and what is to be avoided in its treatment with iron so that it is not ulcerated; and we have mentioned cancer engendered by the mother [i.e., inherent predisposition] and the caution in its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a location where its eradication is possible, such as cancer which is in the breasts or in the groin and similar members, to extract all of it, and especially when it is small at the beginning.
But when it is old and large, it is not fitting to attempt it, for I could not heal anyone of it, nor have I seen another who has succeeded in this.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you proceed and purge the patient, and remove black bile sometimes, and then bleed him, if manifest repletion is found.
And then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is placed for the operation, and then apply to the wound ointments which are suitable for it; and then excavate from all sides with a suitable curved knife, carefully, until no part of its roots remain. And let the blood flow, and do not staunch it lightly, and press the areas, and wipe away the thick blood entirely with your hand or with an instrument which is available to you among the instruments.
But if a large flow of blood from a vein incision or artery gives you trouble, then cauterize it until the flow of blood is stopped, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 44.  (Assuming a standard chapter numbering system)
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy from water, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of ascites, and iron is not applied to the type of tympanites or the type of anasarca, for that is mortal (fatal).
And when you have treated this type of tympanitic dropsy with medicines and your treatment is not effective, then consider: for if the patient has already developed weakness, or has another disease along with this dropsy, such as a cough or abdominal pain and similar ailments, then beware of treating them with iron, for there is danger in that.
But if you see the patient with exuberant strength, and with no other illness but dropsy alone, and neither a child nor an old person, then the manner of operating on them is that you raise the patient between your hands, and the assistant gently presses their abdomen with their hand, driving the water towards the area below the pubic bone, and then take a sharp lancet in this manner:
Let it be two-edged, long, with a sharp point like a lancet; but nevertheless, let there be some shortness in it, little by little, so that in operating with it you do not pierce the intestine and injure it.
And then consider if the dropsy originates from the intestines, for then it is necessary that with the incision you distance yourself from the navel by the amount of three fingers towards the lower parts, directly above the pubic bone.
But if the origin of the dropsy is due to liver disease, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right.
And it is not fitting that your incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, lest the superfluities flow to that weak place.
Then perforate the entire peritoneum with the instrument, and then introduce it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the peritoneum and the viscera, and you will scrape that; and if [it is] the quantity of a fingernail or thereabouts.
Then perforate the viscera until the spatula reaches the empty place, which is the location of the water. Then extract that and introduce an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or bronze or tin, to which in its lowest part there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its end is incised in the manner of a feather, thus:
And at its uppermost end is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately settles on the instrument, therefore evacuating the water in a half-hour quantity, for if you evacuate more of that than is necessary at the time, very quickly the patient dies from the dissolution of his animal spirit, or a fainting fit befalls him which is near death.
But evacuate that according to the quantity of its virtue and according to what the patient's dispositions, the virtue of his pulse, and his well-being signify to you.
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water, the reason being that it is immediately retained by the chain which holds the hole that is above the cup, of which I have told you that you should perforate it in that manner.
And then reinsert the instrument the next day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for several days cautiously, and guard against error so that only a little water remains.
But if you fear for the patient, and leave a large quantity of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and induce sweating in a bath, and expose him to the sun for a long time; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, the spleen, and the liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.
Chapter 54.  (Assuming a chapter numbering system.)
Concerning the treatment of children who are born with imperforate urinary tracts.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the head of its penis is not perforated (or the opening is narrow or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with perforation as soon as it is born, using a very fine probe, according to this method:
And then place a fine lead pin into the opening and leave it there for three or four days.
And when it wants to urinate, it should be stimulated and will urinate; and then replace the pin.
And if you do not place the lead pin, it is possible that the urine, which flows over the area, will not allow it to close.
But that in which the opening is narrow should be treated with a lead pin, as we have said, for several days until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its place, so it is said, the cause is that for them, the one that is born and the opening is below the end of the penis, so that he cannot urinate towards the inner parts, until he raises his penis with his hand towards the upper parts; and it is not generative for him, because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line, and it is a very long-lasting illness.
And the manner of the operation on him is that the patient should be placed on his back, and then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a forceful pull, and incise the head of the penis at the location of the prepuce with a sharp scalpel, like a feather incision, or that you shave some part, so that the middle of it becomes similar to the head of the penis and that the opening falls in the middle place as it should.
And beware of the bleeding in your operation, for this often happens; and stop it with something that will staunch the blood, and care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Of phymosis, which occurs in the prepuce at the head of the penis, and of corruption and blackness and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis.
Often this phymosis occurs on the penis and is a swelling of fleshy tissue.
And of these, one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
For the non-malignant type, you should suspend it with a fine thread and excise it until you have completely cleaned it; and then place on that wound something immersed in Egyptian ointment; and after that, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the phymosis is malignant, of a dark color, then you should apply cautery near its incision and its root.
But if the phymosis is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the phymosis is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you should remove the phymosis that is inside first until it is consolidated; and then you treat the outside part, because when you treat both together, it is not assured that the foreskin will not be damaged.
And if you find in the genitals and foreskin blackness and corruption, then you should remove everything that is already blackened and is beginning to corrupt or is already corrupt; and then apply to it a liniment of honey, which is mixed with crushed and sieved pomegranate bark flour and crushed and sieved nuts.
And then treat it with another remedy until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply lunar cautery according to this method:
because cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, that is, for bleeding and for a wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you must insert into the meatus of the prepuce a lead cannula so that the patient urinates through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis (and this adhesion does not occur except in one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess) it is necessary that you scrape with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate these exquisitely, then you must scrape with a spatula some part of the head of the penis and the prepuce, and this is because the prepuce, when thin, is very easily perforated by its slight thinness.
And then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a very thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then let it be treated with styptic wine until it is consolidated (healed).
Chapter 57.
Concerning the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to those who are circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is of our operation and our will, and since it is performed primarily on infants, it is necessary that we assign to it the best operation and the easiest method leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not describe circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience, which is why I have found the majority of surgeons and barbers using circumcision and cleansing with a lancet and with tweezers; and they use ligature with thread and incision with the fingernail.
And I have tried all these methods and I find no better cleansing with scissors, with ligature with thread than cleansing with the fingernail, because many times the skin escapes higher up, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and is easily forced to another incision and certain pain. And with cleansing which is done with an awl, and is digital, which cobblers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not safe, because it easily enters the hole.
But in the operation with a fingernail, it easily becomes rusty and corrupts your operation. And the foreskin of a child is short by nature, and many times it is born in such a way that it has no need of cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with scissors and ligatures with thread, the goodness, experience has shown me, because the scissors are of proportional incision, for this reason that the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below; and therefore as you hold your hand, two sharpnesses are proportioned, and you incise according to a comparison at one time; and compression is made of the thread with a shape containing the foreskin of the penis from all parts, with which no error is made at all.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child stay, especially if it is one of those who understands a little, that you do nothing but tie the thread on its penis only, and that you leave it until the next day.
And then do that in whatever way is possible for you, given its understanding. And then make the child lie still between your hands, prepared and not at all restless; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them or any other of the instruments.
And then put your hand to his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it until the head of the penis is revealed, and then cleanse it of whatever dirt is gathered there.
The shape of the scissors for circumcision, this is the shape:
Let one end be non-cutting and the other cutting, so that the nail's head does not come out, and let the length of the two sharp edges be like the length of two equally sized handles.
But the error in circumcision is that you too quickly remove the entire foreskin, or part of it, below the incision.
Therefore, it is necessary that you stretch that [skin] with your fingernail before the suppuration of the area and that you incise it evenly.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with forceps and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and what is swollen remains under the inflamed penis, then you should wait until the hot abscess has subsided, and remove that carefully, and incise it as you have prepared.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for it should not be injured.
And then treat it with that which consolidates the wound, from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised beyond measure from the scrotum and affects the parts above, this will not harm him.
And furthermore, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Concerning the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh, and similar to those things we have spoken of in the methods of treatment in the division [of the text/chapters].
And if it is not dissolved by what we have said, and the cause is severe for the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver and be subtly hollowed like a bird's quill, with a thinness of a reed, long in the likeness of a palm and a half, to which there is a thin tube at its head.
And the manner of drawing out the urine with this is that you take a doubled bladder and tie wool or cotton at its end with a good ligature; and introduce the ends of the bladder into the part below the syringe, and cut with scissors if any excess wool remains, but introduce it into the tube forcefully. And then grease the syringe with butter and egg white.
And make the patient sit on a saddle, and rub his bladder and penis with moist oils, and olive oil and rosewater.
And then introduce the syringe easily until it reaches the root of the penis; and then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; and then push the syringe inside that; and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and this shows the patient that it has reached the empty space, and this is not done according to this order, but the meatus where it goes is tortuous.
And then extend the bladder with the wool little by little, because the urine will soak the wool.
Then extract it and do this for urinary cure, and use a syringe; do not cease doing this and using a syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Concerning the method of clystering the bladder with a clamp and similar instruments suitable for this purpose.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or blood clots in it, or putrefaction is constricted there, and you wish to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument that is called a clamp, and this is its form:
except that its end is blunt, that is, closed. And in it there are three holes: two on one side, thus, twice.
At the beginning, there is a concave place, into which that which is to be expelled is placed, and it should be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, until when anything is drawn from the humidities with it, it is drawn out, and when it is expelled, with it let it be drawn out, and when expelled far, as the clamp does with which naphtha is thrown in sea battles.
Therefore, when you wish to draw out the humors from the bladder, insert the end of the clamp into the humor, and draw with it that which is pressed towards the upper parts, for the humor is drawn into the concavity of the clamp.
And then insert the end of the clamp into the urethra as we have recounted in the syringe; and then expel the humor with that which you expel, for that humor reaches the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
The form of the subtle catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is its form:
And let it be made of silver or brass, of which the uppermost part should resemble a small feather, and below it a narrow, smooth canal.
Then take a goatskin bladder, and place in it the liquid that you wish to instill into the bladder, and then tie it tightly between two [points] with a strong double ligature, and warm that liquid over the fire.
And then insert the end of the catheter into the penis.
And then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid with gentle pressure until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and perforate it all around its circumference; and then insert strong thread into these holes, so that it is tightly bound; and then bind the circle so that it is sealed shut, after you place in it what you wish of liquids, oils, and waters.
Then tie this to the instrument and proceed with it as you did with the bladder, and express it with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and their symptoms.
And we have discussed the stone in which one operates by hand and incision.
And the stone generated in the bladder properly is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating that with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that stones generated in the bladder mostly affect children; and among its symptoms is that the urine that is expelled from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his genitals, and often cries out in pain, and is restless; and with this, the anus protrudes in many of them.
And the cure of children from this is easier until they have reached fourteen years; and it is a difficult cure in the elderly. But in young people it is moderate because it is between those [extremes/ages].
And of that [disease] in which the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is contrary to that [i.e., more difficult].
Therefore, to arrive at the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning that we purify the patient with a clyster which removes all the waste that is in his bowels; for this waste sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone through its examination.
Then let the patient be taken with his feet raised and be massaged and shaken gently so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it sometimes jumps from its place.
Then make that [patient's] body between your hands prepared, and his hands should be below his thighs, so that the whole bladder is made to incline downwards.
And then search for it [the stone] and all that is outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately you should proceed with an incision upon him.
And if it does not fall completely under your touch, then it is necessary that you anoint with oil your index finger of the left hand, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is a grown young man, and insert that into his anus. And search for the stone until it is under your finger. And bring it back little by little up to the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards to the place where you made the incision.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with her hand; and command another assistant that with her right hand she extend the genitals upwards, and with her other hand she support the perineum which is below the genitals, near the place where the incision is made.
And then introduce a well-sharpened spatula, of which this is the form: and cut what is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be above the stone and your finger in the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the external incision is wide and the internal narrow, according to the size of the stone that is possible to extract, and no larger, for very quickly by pressing with your finger which is in the anus the stone will come out of the incision, and will be expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones are angular and have sharp edges, which makes their extraction difficult.
And of those that are like a gland, and are round, the extraction is easily done.
Therefore, if it is one that has angles and edges, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not expelled in this way, then you must press on it, or squeeze it with a suitable instrument, the tip of which is like a file with which you press on the stone, and it does not escape; or insert underneath a thin instrument with a curved tip.
But if you cannot reach it, then slightly enlarge the opening, and if you see a flow of blood, staunch it with crushed vitriol.
But if there is more than one stone, then initially place your hand at the opening of the bladder, and then incise it; and then gently push it; and similarly do if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, it is unwise to incise it with a large incision, for this causes one of two things to the patient: either death or continuous urinary incontinence, because the area is not completely healed.
Rather, facilitate its expulsion until it is removed, or work on breaking it up with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Then, when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with aloe and dragon's blood powder, and bind it tightly. And place over that a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be cooled.
Then lay the patient supine on their back, and do not unbind the bandage until the third day.
And when you have unbound it, wash the area with water and plenty of oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazicon ointment until it is healed.
But if a hot, burnt, and corrosive abscess occurs in the wound, similar to blood frozen in the bladder, and urine is thereby obstructed (and this is known by the passage of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will provoke corruption and putrefaction of the bladder.
Then wash the wound with sharp wine, water, and salt, and apply everything appropriate to its treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the entire treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the middle of the penis, and is lodged there, and urination is obstructed, then treat it with what I have previously recommended before resorting to incision, for often because of this treatment, incision is required; and I have proved this, and it is that you take a smooth iron borer, of which this is the form:
of triangular end, sharp, set in wood.
Then take bile, and bind the penis with it below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the iron into the penis, perforating easily until the borer reaches the stone. And turn the borer with your hand on that stone little by little, and you will enlarge the perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side; for the urine will immediately be released.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outer part of the penis, because that is broken, and is expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not suitable for you due to some reason that prohibits it, then tie one bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. Then incise over the stone in that penis between the two ligatures. And then extract it. Then untie the bandages and clean the congealed blood which is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to bandage below the stone, except to prevent it from returning to the bladder; and the other bandage above is only necessary because when the bandage below is untied, close to the extraction of the stone, the kidney returns to its place and closes the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the bandage above, that you elevate the kidney to the upper parts, or that it returns to its place by your action, and close the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of a stone from women.
Stones are rarely generated in women.
But if a stone is found in one of them, then its cure is difficult, and is prohibited in many ways.
One reason is that a woman is easily made a virgin again (i.e., her hymen can easily be re-formed or the damage appears to be healed).
And the second is that you will not find a chaste woman, or a married woman, who willingly reveals herself to the physician.
The third is that you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision for a stone in women is far from the location of the stone itself, therefore requiring a deep incision, and this is dangerous.
But if necessity compels you to this, then you must find a female physician who is skilled, and such a person is rarely found.
But if you are deprived of that (a female physician), then seek a cautious and skillful male physician, or a matron well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who possesses some knowledge of this art.
Therefore, have that person present, and instruct them to do everything you command, beginning with the examination for the stone; the reason is that if the woman is a virgin, they should insert their finger into her rectum and search for the stone.
Therefore, if they find it,  constrict it below their finger, and then instruct them to incise it.
But if she is not a virgin, then instruct the matron to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder, and compress it with good pressure.
Then if she finds it, she should carefully manipulate it from the opening of the bladder downwards with the sum of her strength until she reaches the root of the thing.
And then incise it next to the midpoint of the vagina below the root of the thing, wherever it is positioned, and center the stone in that area, and her finger should not be removed from the stone, constricting below it.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert a probe into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then adjust the incision according to the size which indicates that the stone can be extracted from it.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and smooth and rough, and long and round, and having branches.
Then you should know how many types there are so that you can signify what you want.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the place and hold it for an hour until the bleeding is stopped, and then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
And make sure you have prepared the instruments which are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you are aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been incised, then place powder on the area and compress it with powders and a descending bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will quickly die. And then treat the wound.
Then, when the sharpness of the bleeding has subsided after a few days, and the place has healed, then you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62.
Concerning the incision of a strangulated hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white sheath which is below the genitals containing the testicle, and is called a sheath.
And sometimes it is in the proper tunic which nature prepared for it in the area of the testicle, so that it appears that there is another testicle; and this is the cord of the genital between the white sheath which we have mentioned, and this is nothing but tartar.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the genitals, so that this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it happens due to a blow inflicted on the genitals.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or bloody, or red, or black and foul, or a watery white, and this is what is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white sheath which we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, slightly elongated like the shape of an egg, and it appears above the testicle, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper tunic, then the abscess is round near the testicle, and therefore one thinks it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the tunic of the genitals and the white sheath, then it falls below the feeling (i.e., it is lower down and less easily felt).
And if you wish to know the color of the moisture, then you test the color of the moisture in the abscess with a probe inserted into it, the form of which precedes; and according to what comes out on the probe, judge what is inside.
Therefore, when we come to its treatment with iron (cautery), then it is necessary that we order the patient to be bled if that is possible for you, and you see his body full (of blood).
And then let him lie supine on his back on something a little raised, and place many cloths underneath him.
And then sit on his left side, and order the assistant to stand on his right side, who will extend his finger to one of the two sides to the sheath of the genitals and to the part of the navel of the abdomen.
And then take a broad spatula and split the sheath of the genitals from the middle downwards lengthwise almost to the perineum.
And let the incision be made straight and equally distant from the line where you would cut the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white fat included (within the incision).
And remove that (white fat), and observe, and beware that you do not cut it; and your removal of that (fat), which you remove bit by bit, should be suspended with the most delicate and subtle scrutiny with the removal according to the quantity possible for you.
And then perforate the water-filled fat with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the fat to the upper parts; and do not touch the sheath of the genitals included (within the incision), and incise the fat in the way that is possible for you. And incise it in its totality or in pieces, and especially its thin layer, for if you do not very carefully examine its incision, there is no certainty that the water will not return.
But if the egg (testicle) protrudes from its sheath during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the fat, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the sheath of the genitals with suture, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another disease, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are on the spermatic cord, and remove the testicle, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the fluid (hernia) is collected in two separate parts, then know that there are two hernias; therefore incise that part in the same way that you did the other; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then you perform it.
And then you will wipe away the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place on top another wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread this over the genitals and the area of the belly; and place over it folded cloths and powders, and bind these on top with a bandage which is according to this form:
And then two cloths should be taken and filled with carded wool in this manner; and the ends should be made with which it is bound with cotton or damp wool, and they should be added with a bandage in the waistband of the breeches, and one of the ends should go from the buttock to the groin, and the second should go to the part of the scrotum, and two ends on the two thighs below and two other ends on the two knees, and the entire bandage should be fastened in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with an iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery and that you incise with it the skin of the genitals, and it is ignited as we have recounted until the white, pus-filled cyst is exposed, and then you take a cautery of this form: and it is similar to the Greek letter.
And then pierce the cyst with it, and ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then stretch the cyst with forceps, and scrape it with forceps, and scrape it with a thin, ignited cautery; and incise it as much as possible until you eradicate all of it; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg.
And know that this operation is safer and less prone to bleeding, and better than operation with incision.
But if an abscess forms contrary to expectation during incision or cauterization, or there is bleeding, then you must treat whatever opposes you in this, with the treatment that suits it as described.
But if the patient is fearful and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I have recommended it; and this is when you are certain, because of what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is watery.
Then you should make the patient sit on some elevated seat, then perforate the abscess at its lowest point with a broad spatula, and place the perforation along the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough so that all the water drains out.
Then place a cloth over the area and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water drains out. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the drainage of the water, at that time you should perforate it; and this is done only because the white pannicle in the opening of the wound creates resistance and prevents the exit of the water. Then you must place in the wound a tool with which water is extracted from dropsies, the form of which is shown previously; or apply a small pressure to the wound opening.
And know that the water will return and accumulate again after about six months or so; and when it has accumulated, then it should be perforated in the same manner, for thus the patient will pass their days.
Chapter 63.
Concerning the incision of a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is a danger leading to death in most cases; therefore, in my view, its removal and being saved by that is better.
And I am recalling the operation in that case and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses originate in the genitals which are formed for many reasons: either by an acute, acrid superfluity, which is poured into the genitals, or by percussion (a blow or injury).
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And very quickly is a liquefied abscess, of which the color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by the knotting of the arteries, and by the inflammation of them as it is perceived in its recollection, or by inflammation of the veins.
But that which is from inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when we compress it with the fingers; and it is not fitting that one touch it.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any cause from compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision be made on this type and on the other  fleshes; and it is so that you incise the skin of the genitals, and then extend the testicle upwards, and extract it from the white sheath, and free the suspensory ligament of the vessels, and tie them, and incise the suspensory ligament after you free it from all parts of the parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already consolidated with those inflamed areas, then it is necessary that you extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between any part of the sheath, or between that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you incise all that which is there, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Then, when your operation is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of a hernia that is of the scrotum.
A scrotal abscess is an inflammation enveloped by a membrane similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, fear is to be considered in relation to what preceded it.  (Or: And in treating this illness, the cause that preceded it must be considered.)
However, we must describe the operation as the ancients did.
And I say that you should make the patient sit on a raised seat; then pull the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards; and then hold the scrotum with your fingers and thumbs, with the vessels that are close to the penis; and let another assistant help you, and extend those [the scrotum and testicles] with forceful extension.
Then incise with a sharp, broad scalpel, with a transverse incision, directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape the entire area as we have described in the extraction of arrowheads that are lodged in the temples.
Then place a double-threaded needle in that area, and tie it first at the place where you made the incision, and tie it again at the other end. Then incise it in the middle with a straight incision along the length of the body, and extract what has accumulated of fetid and corrupted humors.
Then treat the wound with the same treatment as other wounds in which you wish healing to be engendered, so that the vessels which nourish one of the two genitals may not be injured, for that is not good.
But if you injure all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed, or that the testicles be tied off along with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they be excised, or tied off so that there is no nourishment to them.
Chapter 65.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture that happens in the peritoneum extended over the abdomen, on the sides of the inguinal rings of the abdominal wall, causing the intestines to protrude through that rupture.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or an extension of it, and these two types occur for many reasons:  a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting something heavy, or similar things.
And the sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and it is a swelling in the groin towards the pubis because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum, is that at the beginning it causes sudden, intense pain; and there is an apparent swelling below the navel, and this is because of the protrusion of the intestine, and its body outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum is expelled along with the intestine, and this hernia is called an intestinal zirbal hernia.  (Note: "zirbal" appears to be a word specific to this text and its meaning requires further investigation within the context of medieval medical terminology.)
And sometimes it is formed with flatulence, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and it is retained there, and this is a great danger for the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of the types of this illness, iron is feared, therefore its use should be avoided.
And the manner of operating on this is that you command the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand to the inside of its cavity if it obeys its return, and then it should be wrapped around his neck between your hands, and elevate his legs.
And then hold the cord which is the spermatic cord at the upper parts, and incise the spermatic cord completely lengthwise; and then place, in the two lips of the incision, hooks as you need to open the incision with them.
And if, according to the amount that is possible for you, the egg (testicle) is expelled from that incision.
And then scrape away that tunica vaginalis which is beneath the spermatic cord, until the hard white tunica albuginea is uncovered on each side.
Then you introduce your finger into that which is the testicle, into that which is between the tunica albuginea, which is beneath the cord of the testicle, and between the second tunic, and resolve with that the adhesion that is in the part behind the testicle.
And then gently grasp the spermatic cord at the outer parts with your hand, and with this stretch the tunica albuginea upwards with your left hand, and elevate the testicle with the tunica albuginea to the edge of the incision; and command the assistant to elevate the testicle upwards and you dissolve the adhesion which is behind with complete resolution.
And search with your fingers that there is no intestine enveloped in the hard tunica albuginea. But if you find any such thing, then you gently push it back down into the abdomen.
And then incise in the part under the spermatic cord, through the incision of which blood and pus will flow, as we have recounted in what we have said.
And then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature which we have recounted (and sometimes the tunica albuginea is cauterized, which we have said near the incision to stop the flow of blood, because this often happens) and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be bathed in warm water, and keep it there until it falls off as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
On a windy hernia (likely referring to a type of hernia or swelling).
In this hernia, I have not seen anyone who has dared to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done as we have recounted in the hernia which is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision on it easily; and then dry the area around the abscess with something that opens it, until the vessels fall away. (This likely describes a surgical approach to a hernia, using wine and cauterization.)
And cure the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the disruption that is made in the inguinal region (groin).
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and it swells the area.
And do not allow any cause of the intestines to descend to the genitals; and if they do, it is a small amount; and it returns in all hours (it returns frequently/constantly).
But if the time is prolonged with this, a fissure is adjusted in the scrotum until the intestine descends into the scrotum; and this happens because of the extension of the scrotum which is in the groin as we have said, the cause of which is that the scrotum is extended, and then it is softened and the place is suppurated and swollen.
And its cure is with cautery, as its description has preceded.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this manner: and that is that the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry the place of the rupture of the swollen abscesses with incision in width according to the amount of three fingers.
And then tighten the white scrotum that is under the tailbone until it is uncovered (or, until it is revealed).
And then take the ray (likely referring to a surgical instrument) and place that on the prominent place of the scrotum, and press that against the pubis.
And then sew the two prominent places on the extremity of the scrotum's ray (likely referring to a specific part of the scrotum), and join one of them to the other with a suture.
And then extract the extremity of the ray (the instrument), and do not incise the scrotum completely, nor extend the wound, nor anything else like what I will let you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat that with the treatment of wounds, and as you incise the veins, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is consolidated; because the scrotum is contracted and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this place, because it is closer to health (i.e., a quicker, more effective cure).
Chapter 68.
Concerning the softening of the swelling of the testicles.
Many times the swelling of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh that is between them is softened, and this hinders their recovery.
Then it is necessary for the one who is engaged in his cure to make the patient lie down according to his position, and incise all the swelling which is softened on the natural swelling; and then that he join the two lips with a suture.
And if you wish, sew in the beginning the superfluity of the softened swelling with three or four stitches and with a firm suture.
And then incise between the sutures; and then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it is healed and the stitches fall out.
Chapter 69.
Concerning castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, but because of that I am obliged to remember it in this book; and its remembrance is necessary only in two ways, one of which is so that it may be within the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it, that he may know the treatment of that which has happened; and the other way is that we often have need of the castration of other animals for our benefit from them, such as of horses, and goats, and pigs, and similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by incision.
But in that which is done by crushing, the method of operation is that we immerse the animal in warm water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then grasp them with your hand until they are resolved and no longer appear under the touch.
But in castration done by incision, you must hold the animal and grasp the cord of its testicles with your left hand.
And then tie off the suspensory ligament, and incise over each testicle with one incision until both testicles are exposed.
And then incise them after you have skinned each one. And do not apply anything to those of the cyphus except the fine cyphus which is over the vessels.
And this manner of castration is better which is done by crushing, because strong crushing leaves little cause for the testicles so that the animal desires copulation.
And then care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Concerning the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is of two kinds: one is when it appears that there is a space in the scrotum, in that which is between two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva in which there is hair.
And sometimes urine flows from that space in the scrotum.
But in women, there is one type:  it is that the woman's vulva above the mons pubis is like two testicles of a man, somewhat smaller on the outside, like a man's prepuce and two testicles.
And the cure is of three kinds: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you incise those constricted tissues until the swelling is released, and then that you treat them with the treatment for other wounds.
And in the second type in men, from which urine flows that is in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Concerning swelling and prominent flesh due to causes in women.
A slight swelling is often caused by natural reasons until it is pressed and examined; and sometimes it is magnified in some women to such an extent that it is spread like in men and extends to the genitals.
Then you should hold the excess swelling with your hand or with an instrument and incise it.
And do not go too deep in the incision, especially near the root, lest a flow of blood ensue.
Then treat it with the treatment for wounds until it is healed.
But a fleshy growth is flesh that grows in the womb of the mother until it fills it, and quickly protrudes externally resembling a tail (and for this reason some first called it "tailed disease"); therefore, we must incise it as we incise a swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of gout.
Alratica (a likely misspelling or archaic term possibly related to difficult childbirth or a related condition) is when the woman's vagina is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a preceding illness, and this is caused either by improperly formed flesh or by a subtle or thick membrane.
And it is formed either in the front of the mother, or on her sides, or in her upper part, or in her lower part, and it prohibits conception and pregnancy, and it strongly inhibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by examining the womb; if the obstruction is apparent, it is evident. But if it is not apparent, then you should search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin membrane, and is close to the two labia, then you should cut and break it.
And you should place powders on the two labia, and then place your index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then forcibly spread the two labia until that thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the area, and keep it moist throughout the day so that the incised area does not consolidate (heal too quickly).
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you should incise it with a broad spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to an abscess, then incise it with an instrument and drain it.
And have with you medicines that stop blood flow without biting (causing further injury), such as acacia, dragon's blood, and enses (possibly referring to a plant or resin), mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep it there for a few days and apply a poultice of dried herbs.
And then it should be treated with another healing method until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the birth of other fleshy growths (tumors), and then it is necessary to incise in this manner. But if this is due to a hard abscess, the hard abscess which is in the breast should not be treated with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids and swellings and red bumps that occur in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the openings of many veins, from which much blood continuously flows; and when they are old, hemorrhoids become swollen.
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will say thus which ones receive treatment and which ones do not receive treatment.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and swellings, when they are in the womb and do not appear outwardly, then in those cases, treatment with iron should not be performed.
But those which are at the opening of the womb, upon which one can feel them, are those that are cured.
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cold place and then extend the swelling with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them at their roots.
And then sprinkle on them, to stop the flow of blood, one of the incisive powders without biting, such as acacia and similar things.
And then bathe her feet for an hour, and then place her in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of pomegranate leaves and bark, and of walnuts, and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine, and make a plaster with this and apply it to her back.
And if the blood is stopped, it is good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, to the breasts without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice, or in comfrey juice, or in rue juice with red wine, and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of a fistula occurring in the mother.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the mother, such as cancer, and stone abscesses, and ulcerative, and swollen, and herpetic, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and boils, and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these diseases and their types and their signs, and their cures, in the division.
And it is necessary that I speak in this treatise of a hot abscess which comes to the mother, when it is among the abscesses which gather pus; and if you wish to know in what manner its operation is done with iron.
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is acute with percussion and phlegm and fever, and sometimes it reddens and if feeling falls upon it; then do not treat it with perforation, but cure it with that which aids its maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
And then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a stool that has two legs; and she reclines on her back and adjusts her feet to the part below her belly, and her thighs are spread, and she places her arms below her knees, and tie each with a suitable bandage.
And then the midwife follows from the right side and administers the instrument with which the orifice of the womb is opened, the form of which will come in those things that are done next.
And it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, that you place with the ray the neck of the woman's womb, and that which of the instrument is inserted into the womb should not be more than the neck of the womb and it hurts the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the neck of the womb, then it is necessary that you place powders on the texture of the neck of the womb so that the entry of any instrument into the neck of the womb is prohibited.
And it is necessary that you place the turning device that runs in the instrument from the upper side and that the administrator holds the instrument and rotates the turning device until the orifice of the womb is opened.
And when the wound appears, and it is touched with the hand and is soft and moist, then it is necessary that you dry that area with a linen cloth.
And when the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a wick soaked in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the calca7 [presumably a type of compress or dressing] on the section in the neck of the womb.
And place outside the womb and on the vulva clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And afterwards it should be cured for about two days with an ointment which is suitable for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed so that it is cleansed with water and honey, and afterwards with water in which the root of lilies or of birthwort has been boiled, and afterwards it returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep within the hidden womb, then you must be forbidden from treating it with iron,  taking care of it with what we have said in the section [presumably a previous section of the treatise].
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives in what manner live embryos should be treated when they emerge in an unnatural way.
It is necessary that the midwife know at the beginning the form of natural childbirth by its signs; and it is that when you see the woman strain in the lower parts and desire to smell the air, and moreover is relieved by what is above her of the birth, and hastens the emergence of the embryo, then you know that this birth is according to natural form, and it is the emergence of the child headfirst, and the afterbirth with it, either suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends easily, because when it descends headfirst, the afterbirth descends with it, and is cleansed of those superfluities with good cleansing.
But that which is other than this birth is unnatural and unfavorable, for when the embryo is emerged feet first and its body is emerged before its head and feet, and one of its hands, or its foot, or its head and hand, or its belly, and quickly is turned about its neck, resembling those unfavorable presentations.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skillful in all these matters, and to guard herself against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what skill is needed in them so that it may be signified by this and be established upon this.
When the fetus is emerged headfirst by natural expulsion, and this is vehement for the woman and is difficult for her, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then have her sit, or have the women support her, and evaporate her vapor with cooked fenugreek and moist oils.
Then the midwife inserts a small, flat spatula between her labia and with it she splits the secundines, or she scrapes it with her fingernail until it removes the moisture within it. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman should be poulticed with mallow mucilage and fenugreek mucilage with saffron.
Then order the person, during the poulticing, to be compressed and make her sneeze with sneezing powders; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
And if both hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you should reduce them carefully, little by little. But if it does not obey the inward movement, then place the woman on a chair and raise her legs, and then jolt the chair on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the jolt.
And if the hands are not returned inwards and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remainder of the fetus, or tie its body to its hand with a cloth and extract it gently, for it will then be expelled.
When the fetus is presented feet first, then you should push them upwards, and then gently turn the fetus, and then grasp it, and then take one foot and gently extend it.
But when it has emerged between the thighs, then you should order her to strain, and make her sneeze forcefully, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then you should return the fetus little by little until you place it in its natural position, for it will then be expelled with ease.
And if it is obstructed despite everything we have recommended, then take mallow mucilage and dissolved gum, and pound everything well in a mortar, and then apply this to the woman's vulva and the lowest part of her abdomen. And then make her bathe in lukewarm water, up to the hypochondria (the regions below the ribs).
And when you see that the lower parts are softened, then give her a fumigation of myrtle and apply it to her. And when she has had the fumigation for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and then make her sneeze and hold her mouth, and lift her up and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle compression, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
Thus of the fetus laterally, holding one of its hands. Let it be managed by reducing her hand; but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her thighs with vehement shaking, and then administer emollient remedies which I have recommended made of mucilages.
And if childbirth has arrived, then make her sit on a stool, and then work on the reduction of the hand, and grasp the fetus according to its natural form, and make the woman sneeze and command her to strain until it is expelled.
Thus of the fetus upon the neck, its hands spread out and its face is towards its mother. It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and then turn it little by little, and that this happens with ease.
And when it is grasped, then place on the neck of it that which we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then command her to cough little by little, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a stool and command her to be inclined on her right side, and then command her to bear down; and make her sneeze with a potion. The prepared fetus exits on its side.
When the horror of the mother ceases according to this manner, consider, and then you incise the secundine with your fingernail until it is emptied of its moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended over its face and neck, then you incise it at the umbilicus, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then push the fetus inwards until you place it as it should be, and tell the woman to bear down a few times, and it will be expelled easily in this way, if God wills it.
The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four, but this is rare and seldom happens; but these are causes of nature, and they do not live.
And count those, even if they are multiple, as one afterbirth, and they are separated by a partition, distinguishing them through the ligament in the umbilicus of each one. And sometimes they are expelled as if it were a single fetus by easy natural delivery, and sometimes they are expelled by unnatural delivery, as we have recounted.
And if some of their births are difficult and lead to what we have said about unnatural presentations, then you should treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and dexterity, and with patience, and is ingenious according to every presentation as it is prepared for her by the intellect leading to health.
Concerning the recollection of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the mother, and it has been verified by me that one woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten, all formed, which was determined by the measurement of the glorious wise men (or learned physicians).
And all this must be within the knowledge of the midwife because it quickly appears similar to that, and therefore she must oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
Concerning the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat a dead fetus using what we have said in the division of medication and it has not been expelled, and you are forced to use a manual operation, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and is not suffering from any of the conditions that endanger her life.
Then the woman should be positioned on the bed on her side, with her head inclined downward and her thighs elevated.
And the assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you moisten the mother's vulva with warm oils and a mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then the midwife anoints her hand with those oils and mucilages, and gently inserts her hand into the mother, and then searches with her hand for the location where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus.
And convenient places for this: then you consider if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, and then you grasp the umbilical cord at its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or at its clavicle, or in the areas near the ribs, or under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is feet first, then at the perineum, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary to hold the umbilical cord with the right hand, and place its curve in the space between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and place the cord in one of those places which we have mentioned, until the empty space is reached.
And then place and put in opposition to it another cord, or a third if necessary, so that the traction is equal, and there is not extension only along its straightness.
Rather, it should be pulled evenly on all sides, so that its extraction is eased, just as is done in the case of tooth extraction.
And it is necessary in this matter that the tension be softened; and if some part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife lubricate some of her fingers with oil and insert them skillfully and loosen what is retained with them.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is expelled, then the cords should be moved to a higher location; and do this until the whole fetus is expelled.
But if the hand is delivered before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until it is all expelled, and incise it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus you should do with the other hand and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or constriction occurs during its expulsion, or there is accumulated fluid in its head, then it is necessary to insert a hooked, pointed instrument between the fingers and split the head and extract the water, or to break it with an instrument which is called an "alundat", the form of which will come with the forms of other instruments in the chapter which is next to this one.
And similarly proceed if the fetus has a naturally large head: and then it is necessary to incise it with a scalpel, or to grasp it with the alundat as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is expelled but constricted below the clavicle, then it should be split so that the moisture which is in the feet is drained.
But if it is not complicated, nor does it obey expulsion, then you should incise the head immediately as much as is possible for you.
And if the lower abdomen is abscessed or dropsical, then it is necessary that you perforate it so that the moisture within it runs out.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction to the mother's mouth is easy.
But if it is constricted around the abdomen and feet, then you must extract it with a cloth which you will have wrapped around your hand, and you should incise the abdomen and feet until what is within them flows out.
But if the other limbs are removed and the head is turned, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's mouth (vagina) is open, then she inserts her hand into the uterine cervix, and with it seeks the head, and draws it with her fingers into the mother's mouth (vagina), and then inserts into it an ounce, or two ounces, and draws it out with them.
And if the mother's mouth (vagina) is constricted by a hot abscess which affects her, then it should not be disturbed; rather, it is necessary to administer infusions of warm, oily substances beforehand. And apply plasters; and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then, if possible, it should be turned; and what we have said should be administered as for a live fetus.
And if this is not possible, then let it be incised in pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that no part of the afterbirth remains inside.
And when you have completed all your work, then administer what we have said concerning the treatment of the hot abscesses which might befall the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then bathe in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb was a dead fetus, and soon after that, she became pregnant again, and soon after, the fetus died again. A long time ago, an abscess occurred in his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and it began to discharge pus.
And I was called to his care, and I treated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied plasters of strong attraction to him, and I extracted a bone from him, and after a few days, I extracted another bone; and I was very surprised, since there should not be bones in the belly.
And then I thought that they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I cleansed the wound, and extracted many bones from him, the woman being in such a way disposed, and she lived in this manner for a long time, with a slight discharge from him.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but because in this there is skill and help, that the skilled physician administers with his hand for a cure.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of incision with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a constrictor in which the [membranes/tissues] are grasped, which constriction has two incisions at the two ends of two poles/rods. But this incision should be more subtle than a constrictor, and be made of ivory or boxwood.
And let the width of each rod be about two fingers, and the thickness of each about one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle space of the two rods are two fittings of the same wood which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions/fittings are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that it is opened with them when you rotate the two aforementioned incisions/rods.
Another form similar to that one, but more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of ivory or boxwood, in the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity are two fittings like those you see, and the length of these fittings is about a palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you wish to open the mother (i.e., the woman's birth canal) with them, then you make the woman lie on the bed with her legs hanging down, having opened what is between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, just as you do with shears, gradually, according to how much opening of the mother's birth canal you desire, until the midwife does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
The shape of the instrument with which the fetus is expelled:
The form of the instrument with which the large head is held back.  (The "2" likely indicates a superscript or annotation not relevant to the core meaning).
And it resembles forceps which have teeth at the end, like this, and sometimes it is made long like forceps according to this form, like this, which has teeth like saw teeth, with which it is incised and held back. Form of a small instrument;  or,  The form of a small tool.
The form of a hook having a spine (or point).
The form of a hook having two spines (or points).
The form of a spatula having two ends with which the head is severed (or cut).
The form of two broad spatulas.
All those instruments are exercised, and when the types of these are more multiplied and prepared by the artisans, the operation is easier and more valuable to men because of their quantity.
And do not neglect any of those instruments which are prepared by you, for the necessity of those is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should command the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze forcefully, and press your hand over her mouth and nostrils, and if by this it comes out, it is good.
And if not, then you take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid and put herbs in it, opening the mouth of the mother, such as rue, and mint, and chamomile, and dried Arabic gum, and cassia bark, and holy thistle. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the pot, and place that over the fire.
And then place a reed cannula in the mouth of the mother, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's womb.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and it is not expelled, then you instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it; and when she has found it, then take it and extract it little by little. But if it is attached to the womb of the mother, then insert her hand as we have recommended, and when she has found the afterbirth, extract it little by little as instructed, so that the mother does not collapse from violent traction. Furthermore, it should be easily turned to the right and left sides.
And if the mouth of the mother (the cervix) is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and medication of the oil with herbs.
But if it is not expelled by all the means we have recommended, then be careful not to tire yourself with repeated attempts at extraction; however, what has come out of her to the mouth of the womb should be left at the woman's vulva, and then cauterize it with ointment and tetrafarmaco; for that will cause it to rot after a few days, and it will dissolve and be expelled.
But when it putrefies, a foul odor rises to her head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then fumigations suitable for this should be administered.
But some of the Ancients already tested fumigation with hellebore and dried figs.
The method of using the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and afterbirth:
Let it be made of glass or brass.
And let the thin end be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigant placed on the embers of the fire.
And hold it there until that fumigant is consumed and repeat with another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus in a child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which are very narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that narrow passage with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the muscle.
And then place on it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then it should be treated with what we have said about the treatment and the lead [likely referring to lead-based ointments].
Of the treatment of fistulas that develop below. (Or: Concerning the treatment of fistulas which appear in the lower area/region).
The fistulas that develop in the lowest part below are knotty and thick, which develop near the anus externally or in the space of one part. (Or: Fistulas that appear in the lowest, posterior region are nodular and thickened, appearing near the anus externally, or in the interspace of one area.)
And it is one fistula or several.
And when that nodule is old and discharges watery white moisture or subtle pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known because something exits from them through discharge and by flatulence; and sometimes the patient suffers from discharge, and worms easily exit from them.
And some of these fistulas sometimes penetrate into the space [between things], into the bladder, and into the meatus of the penis; and some penetrate into the joint of the hip and into the nut of the buttock.  (The phrasing is somewhat awkward.  A more natural English rendering might be:  "And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the bladder and the urethra; and some penetrate the hip joint and the buttock.")
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating the anus from one that does not penetrate is that you insert your finger into the anus, and then insert a thin probe of copper or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all, nor does anything proceed from the opening, such as discharge, worms, or flatulence, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then attend to its cure.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meatus of the penis, then its indication is the urine from that [source] and its prohibition [of the use of that urine], so that the place may be consolidated with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the thigh or into the bone, and causes pain in the surrounding area, then its sign is that the probe penetrates there if there is no tortuosity in the bone, and the appearance of pain in the surrounding area; and that there is constant putrefaction from it; and that no medication is effective, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the cure of those is the work and vanity of foolish physicians, upon which they are fixed.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for, according to what I shall recount to you, and this I have already proven.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back, and raises his legs upwards, his thighs being inclined towards his belly, and then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe penetrates.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, then you should insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel with your finger the probe already discovered by itself penetrating, besides what you feel between your finger and that abscess or flesh, then you know certainly that it is penetrating; and then do not work on that, for there is no healing in that, as we have said.
However, some say that it heals slowly in some men.
And of the medication by which improvement is hoped for in him is that you ignite a slender cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been previously described, and insert that ignited cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those fistulated, fleshy parts resembling a bird's quill are cauterized.
And then treat that with poultices wrapped in linen until all those cauterized flesh sloughs away, and then treat it with flesh-generating and consolidating medicines, and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other cure.
And if the probe enters, and does not penetrate beyond your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a palpable thickness of flesh or abscess, and you see the fistula in that which is the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will dry it with the probe, and let it be in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the tip of the probe arrives, and by the probe it is released and exits.
And then cleanse those fistulated tissues which resemble a bird's quill, and let no part of them remain.
But if a flow of blood happens to come between you and your operation when you are excising those tissues, then the best and most gentle instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire accomplishes two good things: that is, cauterization of those affected tissues and the staunching of blood and drying of the humors.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen or crushed flaxseed until the place is free of pus, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate firm flesh.
And these are medicines in which there is stypticity and drying; when then it is restored it is healed and we do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula penetrates to the rectum and is elongated from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and explore it with that.
And so if you feel the fistula and between you and it there is a covering of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation there except by way of trust and hope.
Which requires one of three methods: either cauterize it as we have said; or dry it until you reach its cavity so that you can insert the poultices and the cure is close; and do not proceed much with incision so that you do not cut the muscle containing the rectum, and that does not happen to the patient thus from the excision without his will; and then treat it with what we have said because it will heal very quickly; or elongate that covering and clean the pus after drying it near the rectum, as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp point, and then cleanse those fistulous tissues which are in the incision where you can with cauterization; and then strive to achieve the restoration of the whole wound with incision, and if the orifice above is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the part of the rectum, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the side of the rectum around the surface of the body with the tail and in the margin of the rectum, then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle for preparing skins in this way:
and insert it into that thread wrapped in five threads or around those; and then insert a probe with thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it is penetrating into the margin of the rectum inside, then you pull the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the rectum; and pull out the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each, and leave it for a day or two, and when you incise the thread in the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues are incised which are between the two ends of the thread and fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it is very close to the perineum, because it is not for you to do this so that you do not incise the muscle; and then do this until it is healed.
The shape of the pointed probe with which the fistula is opened: its curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not incise what is not necessary, as sometimes happens.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows during their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, for either they are between the buttocks similar to charcoal, or they are like grape husks. And of these there are small and large ones, and blood flows from them constantly and it is one, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the months of little humidity, from which flows a citrine water or a little blood with continuous discharge, and are according to the complexion.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you order the patient to sit and strain until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you should grasp and suspend them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, and then incise them at their roots.
But if the hooks cannot hold them because of their humidity and softness, then grasp them with rough cloth or cotton or a pledget of wool, and extract them with your fingers, and then incise them and sprinkle on them some hot powders near the incision, so that they act on them in place of cautery; or cauterize them as is described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey expulsion, then stimulate the patient with a mild stimulant, and let it be washed with that which is in the anus and which will easily obey expulsion when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and you should grasp them with your fingernail, or grasp them with a hook, and incise them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And that which you incise, you must suture thus: take waxed thread and insert it into a needle and then pass the hemorrhoids to the upper parts, and make it penetrate with the needle into the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lowest part of the needle, and it should be laterally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong suture, and then knot the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all, and leave one of them unstitched, so that the superfluity of blood may flow from it.
And then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate; and place that on the anus and command the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat it with ointment or with another cure until it is healed.
And since they are old and that medicine is not effective, then you must scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are moistened and the crust above is removed, which prevents their consolidation; and then treat them until they are consolidated.
Then remove them with a more vigorous scraping than the first, until they bleed much and are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that alamermar, that is, a nail (ingrown toenail), is nothing but a round knot, according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a clove, and it is found throughout the body and especially in the parts below the feet and in the fingers, and because of these, pain arises from the inflammation.
And then it is necessary that what is in the circumference of the nail be incised, and held with forceps or with an instrument, and eradicated from its root; and then treat that.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is described in its chapter.
Moreover, a wart is a small, rough, fistulated, round eminence on the surface of the body, and many times it appears on the hands of children.
And its cure is that you stretch and incise it, or that you bind it tightly with thread or with a skin so that it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize that, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Moreover, a mole is a small, hairy or fistulated, rough eminence on the surface of the body, growing often in the pubic area, and when friction encounters it, it is felt like an ant bite, and it is found all over the body.
And its cure is that you take a cannula of goose quill or vulture quill, and let it be strong, and place that over the mole so that the circle of the cannula contains the parts of it; and then rotate your hand with the cannula so that you incise that which is in the circumference of the mole, and place that in the depth of the flesh, and so eradicate the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a brass or iron cannula, according to this method:
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn out to a thinness, blunt (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that on the said part the apprehension of it may be avoided and its rotation [easier].
And if you wish, cauterize the mole as was previously mentioned in the cauterization of a boil in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the form of the instruments that are used to administer a clyster.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or tin, or cast or hammered brass; and sometimes it is made of these instruments, small and large, according to those to whom it is administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose buttocks are fragile or painful, the clysters for them should be small.
The form of a large and a small clyster:
The head of its cannula, to which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and let there be a distinction where the bag is tied, as sometimes happens.
And the lower extremity, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt (that is, not open) but smooth, tapering to a point; and on one side of it let there be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays and a little larger.
And let the bag, in which the medicines are placed, be of animal bladder or sheepskin, and let its length be one palm.
And let it be perforated with many holes, as it is rolled up; and let the space which is between the holes be the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong, raw flax thread, about ten threads, or thereabouts; and fasten the bag with it; and when the bag is placed in him, bind it tightly at the head of the clyster with two distinct ligatures, and then cauterize each hole:  The manner of cauterizing it is that you fill the bag with medicine which is warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and take care that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then let the patient lie supine on his back, and raise his legs upwards and place under him a cushion upon which are placed cloths or a sheet; and then anoint the end of the clyster with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or something similar; and then insert it into the anus easily, and then the minister takes the bag and squeezes it with both hands and forcefully until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the bowel; and then remove the clyster and the patient lowers his legs.
And if the medicine forces him to do so, let him retain it as long as he can; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
But if you administer this clyster in cases of diarrhea and the evacuation bothers him, then you repeat the clyster until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very fine and soft, like those with which children are given clysters.
Of the cure of plagues.
I have already said in the division of the cure of plagues what was appropriate to the book, and I say thus the cure of those with hand and with medicines according to the fulfillment/completion.  (The "fulfillment" here likely refers to the needs of the specific case).
Therefore I say that plagues are diversified according to what the plagues are made of and according to the place upon which the plagues fall.
And the causes for which plagues are often made are thus:  a stone throw, or incision by sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or with a stick, or with an arrow, or similar to those from many causes.
But the plagues that are in the places of the body are thus: a plague which falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the thigh, and similar to those of the limbs.
And I am recounting the cure of certain plagues so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with the simple plagues of the head, for the remembrance of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from a stone throw or the like, and it has only broken the skin and is a large wound, and you fear the occurrence of a hot abscess in that patient, then you should immediately bleed him, and not delay this; and extract blood from him according to his strength, unless some cause prohibits bloodletting, especially if the blood that has come from the wound is little.
And let the bloodletting be on the opposite side from the wounded part; and guard the patient from repletion and from wine and heavy foods.
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then let his diet be lessened, and let him not approach meat nor wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs in him, a pledget soaked in rose oil alone or in wine in which something styptic is dissolved.
But if it is certain that a hot abscess will form, then place on the wound, if it is recent, its own blood, and air has not changed that little powder which I shall soon describe.
And if the air has already changed that [wound], then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or is from a sword cut or the like, and its lips are not joined together by themselves, then join them with sutures according to the method of suturing I shall describe.
But if the wound has already exposed the bone and hangs, and there is not a small suspensory retention of it, then incise it and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in place of the bone, and order the patient to be fed foods that are thick: heads and cooked foods and similar, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that which is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood might occur, and it is not stopped by medicines, then you search for the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you cut it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity compels you that what we have said is not effective, then you cauterize until the bleeding is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is light; so that you sprinkle this powder on them, for it will consolidate them before the air alters them.
And the manner of the powder is this: take olive oil one part, dragon's blood two parts, unslaked lime three parts; let all be well crushed and sifted, and with it let the wound be filled, and let it be bound with a good bandage until it adheres well to it, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it above with powders and leave it, and do not unbind it while it is thus, until it is not festering, for the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
And sometimes it does this alone with lime, when you do not have olive oil and dragon's blood at hand.
And do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary that it be placed on them and they are fresh, and they are recent wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is in summer time, then this powder is not indicated, but then treat those with what we have said, so that you place on them some digestive ointments, or that you place on them powders of barley flour with water and honey until they discharge pus; and then treat them with other treatment until they are healed.
But if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then you extract it with forceps.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in medication between it and a wound of the head when it is simple.
But if the nerves of the neck or an artery are incised, then if it is a nerve, there is no other remedy than to avoid treating it with something that causes strong astringency, such as vitriol and similar substances, because they are harmful to the nerves and contract them. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is cured with light medicines, such as washing the wound with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or plain oil, and applying a poultice after washing with fresh water and other softening remedies in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or approximate its lips, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep, or there is pus at its lowest part, then perforate it at the lowest point.
But if an artery is incised in the wound and there is a consequent flow of blood, then ligate or cauterize it, or tie it off if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or the whole neck has been incised, and the veins of the neck have been saved, then you should approximate the edges of the wound with sutures over a neck splint and do not touch it; first equalize it and restore it to its natural shape, then tighten it with a decent bandage, and leave it for a few days; and then treat it with ointments which have styptic and healing properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has caused damage to the bone, then clean it, and if there are bone fragments, extract all those that you can; and what you cannot reach, leave it until the wound suppurates, and is separated and the injury is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle on it the powder which has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with that which will be mentioned in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider further if there is a rush of air from the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is fresh with its blood, then you should put powder on it in the first hour, and do not bind it tightly so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but put on an attractive ointment, and unbind it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not at hand, then place old linen on the opening of the wound so that it draws out the moisture; and have the patient sleep on the wound so that what is in it flows out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and it has not caused the patient spasms, tremors of the heart, or constriction of the throat, and you see his other good dispositions, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with poultices and other treatments until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore, treat that according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from an incision by a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what is prescribed for sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has caused damage to the bone, and pieces have been cut away from it, then you should clean the wound and attempt to extract those pieces if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound suppurates, so that their extraction is easier.
And for other accidental wounds in the other limbs, the method of treatment is the same as what we have said.
Of the wounds of the abdomen.
The indisposition which occurs in the abdomen is either great, small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is made difficult in another way, and it is such that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not take care of their replacement immediately, because it opens and swells, making their insertion difficult.
Therefore, the best [type of] rupture is moderate, because in that case the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two previously mentioned types.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two sutures are common and are suitable for suturing other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures are specific to [the abdomen], but however, they are more specific to the suturing of the abdomen.
And I will recount to you each one with explanation and clarification.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has come out through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either because of the small size of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is so, then it is necessary that you warm it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone, or that you boil it in water with squill, cyperus, and spikenard, and bathe the intestine with it until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes this is done with a substance that has astringent properties, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And then, when you see the inflammation to be resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and marshmallow have been boiled, for by this the entry of it is eased with little difficulty.
But if the re-entry is hindered despite this treatment, then incise the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is proper that there is no incision, and there is no need to worry about drying due to necessity and debility.
Concerning the instrument, this is its form:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and the end is thin, and not as thin as a spatula, rather it should be somewhat blunt.
And thus, when the wound is widened and the intestine protrudes, then its reduction should follow its natural form, to its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is wide, and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you should raise their head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, then always direct your attention and consideration to ensuring that the side where the wound is located is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this in large wounds and in moderately sized wounds.
And in small wounds, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant place their gentle hands between your hands, holding the entire rupture with their hand and adjusting its edges, and then remove from that area anything that might obstruct the suture.
And this is the common method of suturing: first, take a needle, or several needles according to the size of the wound; then, leaving the width of an annular finger from the end of the rupture, thread the needle(s), making sure you don't knot the two ends of the thread, using two ends of the tape that is below the thread of the inner parts, until you pass it through that part; and you have now joined two ends of the thread and two ends of the tape, and this makes four ends.
Then tighten with a double knot the loop of the needle, sometimes from both sides together, and then join the two edges of the wound with a neat joining; and leave the width of a finger and place another needle in that space, and tie it with thread as you did with the first needle; and continue doing this with the needles as necessary until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And let the needles be of moderate thickness, neither too thick nor too thin, for thin needles cut the flesh too easily; and thick ones are difficult to thread, therefore they should be of moderate thickness.
And it is important that the needle not be inserted too deeply into both ends of the thread, so that the flesh is not unnecessarily cut and the wound does not reopen before it heals.
And the sutures should not be too long, lest the wound be hindered from healing.
Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient during sleep; and place upon the suture finely powdered substances that will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them there until you know the wound is healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most suitable for small wounds, because for suturing them, one or two needles, or thereabouts, suffice.
But the second suture is common: and that is that you stitch together the four ends, of the thread and two ends of the wound, at once, with a needle on which a thread is wrapped, equal in fineness and thickness.
And then, when with the needle you have penetrated these four ends, return the needle to the same point from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the highest part to the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth suture with which cloths are fastened.
And place between each stitch the width of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And with such a suture I sewed up the wound which had happened to a man in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was more than a palm, and two palms of intestine had come out from the middle of the wound, and the rupture was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he is healed; and moreover, he lived for many years, and is sound in his dispositions.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and it was by a miracle that he was, because I did not cure him with ointment, for it was in a place where ointment was not found nor any medicine, but I placed on the wound old linen twice a day and washed it frequently with honey water until he was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of sutures proper according to the account of Galen.
And it is that you begin with the suture of the chain, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And then, as the needle penetrates the chain and into that same laceration, both straight and along the whole length of the body, leave the end of the thread into which you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate at the other end from the inside to the outside at the other extremity of the wound.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again at that same extremity of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is in this stitch, and make the needle penetrate at the other extremity from the inside to the outside.
And make the penetration with which you make that penetration in the thread at the extremity of the wound which is on his side until all of that penetrates.
And then begin on that same side and sew that with the end of the thread on the other stitch, and extract the needle from the chain which it penetrated, and then return it to that chain and sew the end of the thread which is on the other side with this extremity of the wound; and extract it from the chain which is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this one time then another time until you sew all that is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a leather-stitching suture with which you sew skins, in such a way that you sew the thread once from the side of the extremity of the chain, and that you leave it another time until you have completed it.
But the second proper kind of suture, which is called *Gualia* and this is spoken of by him and recounted by him, is that you sew it according to the half-stitch with which certain healers sew it, in such a way that you join each part to its corresponding part in a way suitable by nature; and you apply the end of one to the other and the end of the wound to the other end of it, and this is done as I have recounted to you.
So that you place the needle in the extremity of the wound close to the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner part in that sole place, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside in the two ends of the thread.
And then turn them each one, and make each one penetrate from the inside part to the outside part in two other extremities of the wound which are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common light suture, and it is the suture of which I have previously made mention.
This is the discourse of Gualia.
And moreover, some say, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, that is to say, that you introduce into each of these a thread, and begin with the introduction of the needle from what is nearest to you, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew hides similarly.
And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then the suture of it is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
But the judgment of the treatment of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
The reason is that when you treat a fresh wound with its own blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestine and sew it and prepare it properly, then place an incarnative powder upon it.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then place upon it some ointments which are at your disposal until they form a hard skin and the threads fall out, and are consolidated with cypress and myrrh; and then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines at hand, then immediately place upon it, as soon as it begins to suppurate, old linen, and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you do not need other medication in many cases when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will spread to the principal members, then it is necessary that you submerge wool in oil of good quality, or in rose oil, and place it in the area around the armpits and under the arms.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in the intestines, for often this happens, then cauterize it with warm, black styptic wine, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and an opening has been made penetrating into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is of easier healing than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not receive healing from a wound that falls upon it at all; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of the magnitude of those veins, and because of the subtlety of the body of that intestine, and because of its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is the web (likely referring to a membrane or tissue), and you obtain that recently, reduce it according to your skill with which you reduce the intestines equally.
But if it has passed into the space and has already become green or black, then bind it tightly with a thread over the place that is blackened, so that a flow of blood comes, because in the web are veins and arteries.
And then incise that which is beyond that ligament, and place the two ends of the thread hanging down from the part below the wound outside it, so that the attraction of it towards the falling of the web and the emission of the arm of the wound might be relieved above you.
A reminder of wounds when they happen in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some men, because of this, for I saw one who had been wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and had formed a fistula, and from it came a discharge and flatulence.
Then I pursued his cure, although I was not confident in his healing, but I continued to treat him until he was healed and the place was consolidated (healed completely).
And I, after I saw the place consolidated, feared for the patient that some ill accident might befall him in his belly; and no ill accident befell him because of this, and he resumed his usual habits of eating and drinking, and then he entered a bath and exercised as instructed.
And some experienced men have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner:  that you take ants with large heads; and then join the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants, with its mouth open, over the two lips of the wound; then when it bites those and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere and not dissolve.
And then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease to do this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the entire wound.
And then reduce (close) that and sew the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm will come to the patient.
And it is also possible that the intestine be tied with fine thread which is made from the gut of an animal, since it is thinner than a needle; and that is that you take the end of these gut threads, and it should be very clean, and then tie its end with its thread, wrapped around, and then insert that thread in needles and sew the intestine with it, and then reduce it in the disruption.
And this method of suturing with ants is only a matter of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, because then it is only a reduction [in size], and not a complete healing of it.
Of the treatment of a fistula and fistula.  (The repetition suggests perhaps different types of fistula or a more emphatic title.)
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated and discharges pus constantly and is not excised, then, in whatever limb it may be, is universally called a fistula, and we call that a zuchem.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hardened,  hard, white knot, which is not painful and which has a concavity like the concavity of a bird's claw; and for this reason it is called a claw-like ulcer, that is, a claw.
And in some men it is moist, which discharges pus; and quickly the moisture is excised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and it is little, and it is coarse, and it is subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of them, and their treatment with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that I make you know the treatment of fistula which is done by way of operation with the hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the diaphragm, or the intestine, or the bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the joints composed by composition, as is the case with the hand and foot; and those that damage the proximity of a principal member are similar.
Therefore, that one of these fistulas which is according to this manner is among the illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive a cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach those places that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its healing, and you wish to arrive at its knowledge, then take a probe of bronze or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, and search for it with it.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, with the lightness of its body, is eased and bent along the tortuous path.
And if the fistula has many horrifying turns, it is not possible for you to determine its course with a probe.
Then, inject a clyster into the orifice, for the humidity with which you inject it will go through the other orifices and clean them.
And then inquire exquisitely, in whatever way is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and whether the depth of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a fistula that has many orifices, and base this entirely on your strength, on your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain through your compression with the hand on the place, and similar signs and accidental causes of the abscess.
And when you have considered all those causes with true judgment, then proceed to the treatment confidently: that is, you consider then if the fistula is near the surface or in a safe place, far from a joint, or from a nerve, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from one of the places which I have told you about.
Then you dry the fistula as was said before in its description, and remove what is in that filtration and of corrupted flesh, and that which has grown in the orifice of the flesh, or of skin and the like, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it in front as much as is possible for you, and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh; and then administer cauteries wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce them into the depth of the fistula, which you have grasped with an iron instrument.
And do this with those cauteries several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you should investigate it and dry it as we have recounted, if you do not prohibit any cause from a vein or nerve or principal member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with that which will cause it to regenerate flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the total eradication of the corruption; and then uncover it again and meticulously perform its scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which you have not reached, and then for you in that case there is nothing to do but leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to pull it out, then pull it out with fine forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then meticulously perform the extraction of all of them, and of these do not leave anything behind with your strength.
But if any of the humors cause you difficulty, and there is no fear or error in their incision, then incise those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then apply something to the wound that will suppurate the wound, and leave it until it reaches the area around those bones of flesh and ligaments, and watch the wound so that it does not heal, and keep constricted the incision which you made in your operation.
Furthermore, if you are afraid, place on it a cloth soaked in crushed rue with oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments, for when those ligaments suppurate, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and their extraction is eased.
But if it is a large bone, such as the bone of the leg or thigh or similar to those, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it with a rasp only superficially until that blackness and corruption is removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and incise everything up to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat that until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use this as an example and help in your operation.
There was a young man, around thirty years of age, who experienced pain in his thigh, and from the internal parts a diseased matter moved through the body until the matter reached the thigh, a matter of abscess with a large abscess, and there was no external cause for it.
And then time was extended with that because of the error of the physicians until the abscess was opened, and many matters flowed from it, and its healing was delayed until the leg was fistulated, and many orifices were made in it, all of which discharged pus and humors of the body.
And then many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wisdom in them nor in their art, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matters that flowed from those orifices in great quantity; and the body of that man was completely emaciated and his complexion was jaundiced.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and the probe reached the bone.
And then I examined all the orifices and found them to reach to the bone from all parts of the leg.
And then I considered and incised one of those orifices until I uncovered a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted, and it was already earthy, corrupt, and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted, where it had penetrated to the marrow.
And then I sawed off what was uncovered and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I believed that in the bone there was only that corruption which I cut away and sawed off, and I had already eradicated it.
And then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicine for a long time, and it is not healed.
And then I iterated and uncovered the bone a second time, upon the first uncovering, and I found continuing corruption in the bone.
And I sawed off what appeared to me to be that corruption, and then I was forced to perform its cure and restoration, and it is not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and did not cease to incise the bone little by little, particularly and forcefully attempting its restoration, and it was not restored until I incised about a palm's breadth of it, and I extracted that with its marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it is lightly consolidated and healed.
And further iteration in its operation and section is not necessary except for the disposition of its fragility and for the scarcity of its tolerance and fear of death, because syncope afflicted him at all hours due to superfluous evacuation of ill humors.
And therefore it is healed by a complete healing, and there is nothing in place of the hard bone flesh; and its disposition in its body is made good and its strength has returned; and it is converted to its dispositions and caused him no impediment in walking or harm in any matter.
But if the bone is prominent in the place of the flesh already removed, then it is necessary that you treat that according to this manner: that you take a ligament and bind that to the extremity of that prominent bone, and command someone to extend it upwards; and place another woolen ligament, thicker than the first ligament; and then bind that over the flesh that is below the bone, and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh to the parts below, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you want to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
And place wood or a board beneath the bone decently, for when you do this, the saw is not prohibited from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be done over the corrupt place little by little, for if the corruption is in the concavity of the bone and does not appear in its apparent presentation to the senses, then force the sawing of it another time.
And if the bone is corrupt and not prominent, but one part is continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle or part of it, then you uncover the flesh from all parts completely; and then place wood underneath, and then saw that from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous with the other part.
And let the sawing be according to the location of the corruption, little by little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupt joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no reason for it but ingenuity/skill.
And if the corruption is in the chest/breast of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, it is necessary that you investigate the corruption in whatever manner appears to you, and that you open it, and clean it according to any disposition which is possible for you, and with each tool be rectified for you, when it does not injure you by vein or nerve.
And know that the incisors and saws to incise these bones are many according to the placement of the bones, and the preparation of those, and the thickness of those, and the subtlety and the size and the smallness of those, and the hardness and their rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument convenient to that operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the type of instrument which you should choose; when with you there is great study and long and complete knowledge of the methods of this art, and experience of kinds of illnesses, because then you will already have for yourself what is convenient in instruments for every illness.
And I am forming for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will place among the simple ones with which you will proceed in your practice which you will experience over the others. Form of saw:
Form of another saw:
Form of another large saw:
Form of a saw (or rasp): Let the head of this saw be according to the form of a star-shaped key head, and its points be according to the form of awl points.
And it is only suitable that with that (saw/rasp) the heads of the joints are scraped when they are corrupted, or the opening is very wide.
Form of a smaller razor:
Form of a broad/wide razor:
Form of another saw decently made: let its arc be made as high as possible, and its sharpness of iron, and its member of  wood, a handle decently made. Its form/shape:
Form of a razor which has a concavity:
Form of another subtle/fine razor:
Form of another razor with a curved end/extremity:
Form of a small razor similar to a tentacle/probe:
Form of another, smaller incisor:
Form of another incisor; this one resembles a ray, and its extremity is like a saw, and it is used in many places in the treatment of bones:
Form of a ray which is suitable for the treatment of that which is perforated in the bones:
And its extremity is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, it is necessary that all the things we have said of razors and incisors and saws [apply to this instrument as well].
Of the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
The extremities may be affected either by an intrinsic or extrinsic cause; or if you have treated that corruption with medication and the treatment is ineffective, or if you see the corruption spreading through the limb without any apparent cause, then you should incise that limb to the point where the corruption has reached, so that the patient escapes death or a malignancy that is a greater impairment of the limb.
And the sign of that which afflicts him is that the limb is blackened as if burned by fire, or the blackness spreads until the putrefaction enters that limb so as to affect it and reach the whole body; therefore, treat it with an incision.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the impact of some poisonous creature, such as a sea scorpion, a viper, or a spider, and the like.
And if the corruption or the injury is in the extremity of a finger, then you should incise the finger and not give space to the corruption so that it spreads to the hand.
And similarly, if it affects the hand, then you should incise it from the root of the wrist, and do not give space to the corruption so that it spreads to the forearm.
And if it affects the arm, then incise the arm up to the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then in that case the patient's death is certain; and to administer anything else besides this in treatment is a waste of effort/virtue.
And similarly, if corruption affects a toe, then you should incise it up to one of the ankle bones.
And if it takes hold in the instep of the foot, then you must incise the whole foot. But if it rises up into the knee, then you incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy for him, only release, and leave the patient to die.
And the manner of incising or excising a limb is that you tighten a ligature on the part below where you wish to incise, and tighten another ligature above the area; and the assistant stretches a ligature on the lower parts, and the assistant stretches another ligature above; and you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures in such a way that all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be incised or excised.
And it is necessary that a linen cloth be placed on all parts so that it does not touch the healthy area, and that the patient experiences appropriate injury and a hot abscess.
But if you encounter a flow of blood while operating, then you should carefully cauterize the affected area, or apply some blood-stanching powders; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have recounted to you, which is that a blackness occurred in his foot with a burn that resembled a fire burn.
And that corruption occurred first in his toe before spreading to the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself, for he saw the cure proceeding to the limb with such vehemence that he was overcome by pain and burning, and he incised that foot up to the joint, and it healed.
For a long time he suffered the same corruption in the finger of his index hand.
And then he came to me, and I attempted to repel that excess with what I applied to his hand in medicine, namely the purification of his body; and the excess was not repelled and began to spread to another finger, until it began in the hand.
And he asked me to incise his hand, but I did not want to do that, hoping for the repulsion of that excess, and moreover fearing lest the incision of his hand cause death, because the patient's strength was failing.
And after he departed from me, he returned to his land, and it came to me that that man prepared and incised his entire hand, and he was healed.
And this narrative is added only to be of assistance in the treatment of this illness, and to give a meaning by which it may be understood and according to which treatment may be undertaken.
Concerning the treatment of sinuses and the nature of clysterization with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in fleshy limbs and the space of the abscess is extended until it forms a collection of pus, and then is broken and perforated, and the pus flows out, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is above it is like a thin cloth, and it has not reached further corruption, and does not affect the bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and not a fistula.
However, if the space is extended to the point that the corruption affects any member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And its treatment is to incise that skin completely as it is swollen, and especially when it is thinned and made like a cloth, and ensure that it does not adhere to the place through its corruption.
But if you expect that the skin will adhere and that the corruption has not spread further, and there is looseness of the skin, then you treat that with a clyster.
And it is that you consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the arm that is there has a foul odor, then you should clysterize it with an Egyptian medicine which is of oil and sharp wine and vinegar, taking equal parts, and they are mixed in a vessel, and cooked over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then you take what is necessary from it and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize the sinus with that, and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
And then extract that with a syringe; and do this for so many days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with lye water, when you do not have this medicine present; and it is that you take the ash of vine wood, and put water over it; and then strain that and clysterize with it until you are convinced that the sinus is then clean.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the lye water, then clysterize with water and honey with crushed vinegar mixed in, and clysterize with wine and honey mixed, for it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes it adhere to the sinus, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are convinced that the sinus is now clean, then clysterize it with something that causes flesh to grow there.
And it is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or that you clysterize with some other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow so that the clyster nozzle cannot enter, then you should widen it little by little with a small instrument, and place a small tent wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment inside until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should approximate its lips with sutures and leave an opening large enough for the clyster to enter without further enlargement.
And if the opening from which the pus drains is situated higher up, then dry the lowest part of it so that the pus may flow downwards, for when the pus is confined to the depth of the sinus, flesh will not grow there.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus to the lowest point as you wish, then endeavor to prepare the limb with a preparation by which the pus will drain slightly, according to your ability, so that nothing obstructs the flow of pus.
But the cloth that is over the opening of the sinus, change that frequently so that the pus that collects there may drain. And so that you may know if the pus that flows from it is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And with this, you should consider the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter ejected onto the opening of the sinus is already adhering, or is about to adhere, then remove it on the third day; and when you remove the dressing, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if near the sinus there is a subtle poison, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is near, for there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and others in whom the opposite is true.
And if undigested pus has been issuing from the sinus for many days, then know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and the cause prolonged, then you should adjust to drying medications; and if the medications are moist in their substance and in their effect, they are dry like diachylon ointment when superfluous addition of resin is adjusted to it.
And the best remedy with which it is cured, is that you take diachylon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and add old,  strong wine to its substance, and carefully mix that with it, and use that.
And it acts similarly in that situation, when there is no pus: diachylon ointment, honey cooked until thickened, and use that; or take myrrh, aloes and incense, crush everything and pulverize it over the honey while it is on the fire, and then apply this on a cloth and bind it over the sinus; and apply that with the honey that you have cooked until thickened, and powder it over a cloth and bind it.
And sometimes are administered with it aristolochia longa and roots of lily of the valley (and it is lily of the valley) and flour of rye and centaury, and use these simples or compounded, crush those, sift them and powder them over the honey which has been mentioned; and use that.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the depth of it, and it has already spread to the bones or to the other hard parts or ligaments; then you treat it with fistular treatment, as above mentioned.
Of the treatment of paronychia and worn nails and added digit incision and section.
Paronychia is an abscess which arises under the nail of the finger or toe of the hand or foot, and quickly spreads to other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its cure is less valued, or it is inflamed by a hot abscess, or it is corrupt, and throws out pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and quickly corrupts the whole of it, and quickly spreads its corruption to the bone until there is a foul smell to it, and the extremity of the finger becomes swollen, and its colour becomes dark.
And therefore when you have treated this with what we have said in the division and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary that you incise with an iron all the superfluous matter that remains of the nail and then cauterize the wound nearby, because a hot cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is healthy, and the additions to the nail, now empty, compress the flesh at the inner parts, and begin to prick and injure it, then it is necessary that you place a fine thread under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it up and incise that flesh easily, and place on what remains of the flesh some corrosive burning medicine until all is removed; and then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone and extract it, for a bone that is corrupt will never heal.
And if you see the corrosion and corruption going into the finger, then you should incise it in one of the joints, according to the way its treatment is prescribed, and then cure it until it is healed.
But if the nail suffers from percussion or attrition, and there is vehement pain in it, then you should first bleed the patient, and then cut the nail with a sharp instrument with a transverse section from above downwards, and be careful that the section does not reach the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause the patient intense pain, and it will cause the generation of superfluous flesh in that place; and then treat that place with something that relieves pain.
But a finger that is born with such a condition in the hands of some men is completely fleshy, and very quickly it is bony, or very quickly it is in the nail.
And some of them are born at the root of the joint, or their origin is in some of the joints of the fingers. But that which is born in some joint of the finger does not hurt, and that which is born in the joints is very quickly painful.
And of those that are born fleshy, the incision is easy, and it is so that you incise that one below its root with a broad instrument.
But of that which is born at the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of its excision.
But in that which is born in a finger between the knuckles, it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a round incision down to the bone, and then saw it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then cure it until it is healed.
But consolidation which happens to the fingers between their knuckles, either by the birth of a man thus, or by the consolidation of a wound, or by burning with fire, or similarly, then it is necessary that you cut that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in rose oil so that they are not lightly consolidated, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until it is consolidated as necessary.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you cut that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of vices, these are varices.
Vices are varicose veins, and they are swollen, thick veins full of melancholic superfluities which appear in many parts of the body, and most often in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and porters.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile a few times with a strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.
But the treatment of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are incised and that black blood is drawn out, and the other method is that the vein is elevated and completely extracted.
The incision is done in this manner: first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick, feculent blood of the leg is resolved. Then bind the patient's leg tightly from the highest part of the thigh to below the knee with a bandage. Then incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision. Then draw the black blood out with your hand, from below the leg upwards, and from above downwards, until the quantity of blood you desire and deem sufficient has been released, and which will remove the strength of the ailment.
Then bind it up, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
But their elevation is according to this manner: you who shave the patient's leg, if it is very hairy, and then put it in a bath and bathe the leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins are prominent; or if a bath is not available,  have the patient perform strenuous exercise until the limb is heated.
Then incise the vein in the right place along the vein, either behind the knee or at the lowest point of the leg near the ankle.
Then open the vein with an incision and scrape the vein on all sides until it is sensitive, and it is from its appearance that you see this redness tending toward blackness.
And then, as you remove it from the vein, you see that white thing which is like a cord.
Then you place a leech below it so that it is elevated and is drawn to the vein, and suspend it with golden thread.
Then make another incision near that incision for three fingers' breadth, and scrape the vein from the upper part to where it appears.
Then elevate it and incise it in the back section near the heel, and then extract it and elevate it until it is released through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision which is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is most superior or highest of all the incisions, until all of it is out; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey you to be extracted and elevated, then introduce a needle with strong double thread and tie it and extract it, or introduce a leech beneath it and move your hand in all directions until it is drawn out. And be careful that it is not incised; for if it is broken, it is made difficult for you to elevate it much, and it becomes harmful for the patient because of that damage.
And when that is entirely removed, then place on the site of the wound wool soaked in rose-scented wine and olive oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having a tortuosity to which there is a convolution in the parts, and it is not according to the straightness as we have said, then it is necessary that you incise it at every part of its tortuosity and at the places of its convolution, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it entirely.
And be careful in your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not injure it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your prudence in this.
Form of the incision with which the vein is cut:
It is not as sharp as hooks, nor is it of a sharp extremity so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of considerable flexibility, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein because of its thinness; it has superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Al-Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the hot and arid lands of India, of little moisture, and in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And it is easily generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents, worms, and scabies, and worms are generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the onset of this vein is that a vehement inflammation occurs in the leg; and soon the area is blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blister, which resembles the root of a plant.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one drachm to two drachms, and tie it and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as you see some cause of it in the outer parts, wrap it in lead and tie it. And if the growth is prolonged, then you should incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise it at the root until it has emerged, for if you incise it at the root, it is retracted and enters the flesh and causes an abscess and suppuration in the area and a bad ulceration.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is completely removed and no part of it remains in the body.
And from this vein it has emerged in some men to a length of five palms and fingers, and it has even happened to me that one emerged of twenty palms.
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, then insert a probe into the opening and perforate it with a long opening to the body, until everything that is in the matter is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the area for several days with medicines; and then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many openings appear on it, and a branch emerges from each opening.
And therefore treat it as we have said in the division and with what has been said above.
Concerning the incision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
This illness is called in some lands near us bovine illness because it often happens to cattle, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending, and it is shown by the feeling of its movement from limb to limb until it breaks through the skin and comes out.
And its generation is by the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and earthworms and ascarids happen in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it goes into the body and is elevated to the head, and it has reached the eye, then very quickly it enters and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you want to cure this and extract it, then it is not done except by its movement and appearance to the touch, and then it is necessary that you constrict what is above it and what is below it with strong binding and constriction, and then cut above it and extract it.
And if it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you do not find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies, and the greatest thing that is feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the place as we have said.
But if you see it has reached the head near the eye, then bind above the eyebrow with a strong ligature, and then cut above it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use purification of their body with medicines evacuating bad putrid humors, and guard against foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the disease *nafir*.  (Nafir likely refers to a specific illness; without further context, a precise translation is impossible.  It might be a transliteration of an Arabic or other non-Romance word.)
This illness is called *nafir* in our land, and it is a pain which comes in certain limbs, and then is moved from limb to limb.
And I have already seen that, as I shall relate to you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small inflammation in the superficial vein of the arm, and after it remained for an hour, I saw that inflammation moving like a worm climbing upwards, but more lightly than a worm, as if it were quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and fixed itself in the muscle, and remained there for about an hour.
And then it ran to the other side until it reached the other arm.
And then I remembered that it moved through her whole body as I had seen; and I was very amazed at its movement and its speed from limb to limb. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in this manner, however I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my eyes as I did in the woman.
And I considered that this was so because the woman was old, with dry flesh and exposed veins, and in this case, that windy sensation was apparent in its movement.
And it is necessary that it not appear, according to this backward cure, in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press on that place lightly and dry it until that constricted windiness has exited, and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you treat it with chest percussion and with things that expel winds, and drive them out with foul-smelling pills and pills of serapium and the like.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in the body where they land, for their diversity is that some have large points, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones, that is, solid ones; and some that have three angles, and some that have barbs; and some that have feathers.
And of the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone, and comes out of the skull which is above the brain, for there happens a sudden violent headache, and dimness of vision, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and loss of understanding, and vomiting of bile, and quickly speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed, and there comes from the place of the wound a white moisture similar to pus, and the eyes appear watery like the flesh.
And therefore if these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment and from the extraction of the arrow, unless it is outside [the skull].
But the signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart, is that it is near the left nipple, and feels as if it were stuck in something hard, and not in something empty; and very quickly the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope; and then know that death approaches without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are thus: the expulsion of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels that are near the neck are inflamed, and the color of the patient is changed, and he breathes heavily, and he desires the intake of cold air.
And if the arrow falls into the diaphragm which is in the chest, and the pain then is near the small ribs, and the wing is made large with violent pain and with sighing, and not all the members of the muscles are affected.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then very quickly some undigested food comes from the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the abdomen, and is stuck in it, there comes some discharge of pus from the wound, or intestine which is ruptured, and there is no hope in its cure without the extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine is released, and some matter proceeds from it to the outer parts, and very quickly pain comes upon the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other members, such as the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the armpits, and the vertebrae of the back, and the clavicle, and the hip, and the leg and similar members, are saved according to the best dispositions when the arrow does not find a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I recount this to you that I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may know from this about your own treatment.
The reason is that in one man an arrow fell into the lacrimal duct of his eye at the root of the nose, and I extracted it for him from the other side, below his ear, and he was healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which fell into him in the corner of his eye, below the eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden and I only found a small tip with which it adhered to its shaft; and it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion head on it which had no barbs.
And the Jew was healed, and no ill accident befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had fallen into his throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, and this one had barbs; and then I made an incision on it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I was careful with it, and then I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and therefore, since thirty days had passed and nothing had changed about his condition, I made an incision over the arrow and pulled it out, and he was healed, and no harm befell him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound had healed over him, and since it was then about seven years, the arrow came out at the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman into whom an arrow had fallen in her belly, and the wound is healed within her, and nothing is changed in her condition, and the woman finds no impediment in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow fell in his face, and the wound is healed and the arrow broken, finding here no great pain, and many similar to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the man, one of the king's princes, that had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already inclined a little to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to his treatment for the arrow wound within three days.
And then I found the arrow wound very narrow; and then I examined it with a thin probe, and did not feel it; but he felt a prickling below his right ear, and then I suspected that this prickling was due to the point of the arrow.
And I plastered the area with a plaster which has attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the area would fester so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut it out.
And no significant incident occurred in the area indicating that the arrow had reached that place; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no incident occurred; and the wound consolidated meanwhile, and the patient rested from its extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with a probe I examined it, and found the tip of the arrow, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I applied to the opening of the wound that sharp medicine until the point of the arrow appeared to me visibly, and I spent time with this for a period of up to four months.
And then, when the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to introduce forceps into it, and remove it, and I did not succeed in this way, then I did not cease to refine and contrive on it with ingenious methods, until I succeeded one day in taking it out with cleverly made forceps, as the form of these will appear at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored that wound.
And some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound is healed, and the patient is completely healthy, and he suffered no harm from it in any way.
And I recount to you the manner of extraction of certain arrows so that you may establish a rule and understanding concerning that which I have not said, for the details of this art and its definitions are not comprehended in a narrative nor do books contain them.
And wise artisans compare the little with the much; and the present with the absent; and find new operations and instruments because of the unexpected occurrences of strange things in the art.
Therefore I say that arrows are not removed from the limbs in which they are fixed except in two ways: either by traction from the place where they enter; or by counter-traction from the opposite side.
And that which is removed from the place where it entered, is an arrow lodged in fleshy tissue, and is pulled and removed.
And if it does not yield to such treatment at the time of extraction, then you must leave it for a few days until the flesh around it softens, and its extraction and removal are facilitated.
And similarly, if it is lodged in bone and does not yield to such treatment, then leave it for a few days and repeat the traction and movement each day, and it will eventually be removed.
And if it still does not yield after a few days, then you must perforate the bone around the arrow on all sides with a fine drill until the area around the arrow is widened, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body and is beyond feeling, then you should probe for it with a probe; and if you feel it, then extract it with instruments suitable for its removal.
And if you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the projectile, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then you should enlarge the wound so that it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if it is held by barbs, then you should free the flesh in which it is embedded from all sides with all the skill you can muster; and work on this, if you cannot, by evicting the flesh in the area of the barbs and twisting them until they release.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use twisting with your hand and forceps on all sides until it yields; and proceed with great subtlety so that the arrow is not broken and so that its extraction is not made difficult for you.
And if you cannot do it at that time, then leave it for a few days until the parts surrounding it soften, and then repeat the attempt, for then it will be easier. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then administer what we have said concerning its treatment in the appropriate chapter.
And be careful to avoid cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use every possible means to remove the arrow; and do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I have recommended to you.
And therefore make the arrow straight so that the patient is positioned according to the way the arrow entered, for this is more helpful. But if this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to the circumstances.
But if arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part of it projects outside the body, or if the arrowhead causes swelling at the extremity of the wound, and this swelling is noticeable, then cut above it; and let the incision be of such a size that the forceps can grasp it; and then pull it out, for it is easily removed in this way.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrowhead enters the bone, and widen the opening, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow remains inside, then push it in completely.
But if the shaft has fallen out and you want to administer a push, then introduce, if it is blunt, a concave instrument so that the concavity fits onto the end of the arrow and then push it in completely.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then push it in with a strong instrument entering it, for the arrowhead is thereby eased.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you should cut away all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with whatever is appropriate.
And if the arrow enters the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then cut around it, and be careful not to cut any veins or nerves, and extract it, and then sew the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
The form of forceps with which arrows are drawn:
Let their ends be like the beak of a bird, which are made like a saw when they grip the arrow so that they do not let go of it.
And of these, many types are made, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the size of the wound, and the tightness of the place.
like a ray, so that the entry into the concave arrow is eased and is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which the customary number is thirty, of which sixteen are in the head; that is, two pulsating veins which are near the ears, called alhasisain; two veins which are in the two temples, apparent; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes which are called aspicientz; and the vein situated in the middle of the forehead, and the vein which is at the tip of the nose; and two guidegi which are at the neck; and two veins which are in the upper lip; and two veins which are in the lower lip; and — these are the veins which are called algelic —; and there are two veins which are under the tongue. But the veins which are phlebotomized in the arms are five; for of these, one is the cephalic, and it is on the wild side (of the arm); and the common people call it "the vein of the head", and it is a blind vein, and it is a median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilic, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people call this one "vein of the whole body", and the basilic is the vein which is situated on the inner side of the arm, and is called "citillar", and the vulgar name it "vein of the belly"; and funis of the arm, and it is situated on the forearm, and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the elbow by manifest appearance; and salvatella, and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger, and there are two branches in it.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of these is below the bend of the knee on the outer side; and the second is the saphena, and its location is below the leg on the inner side; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the outer side; and in the leg there are other veins similar to those.
The benefit of opening the veins near the ears is for old cataracts and migraine and sahafati (a likely corrupted or archaic term, possibly referring to a specific ailment) and old, malignant head ulcers.
And the manner of bleeding those veins is as I recount to you:  it is that the head of the patient should be raised, and the head of the patient should be rubbed at the occiput, at the location of both veins, with a wide cloth, with good friction; then the patient should tighten their neck with a bandage until the two veins and their locations appear near the ears in two depressed places of the head; and feel for them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those with your finger, then bleed there carefully.
Then you take the lancet, which is sharp, and then you insert it below the vein in the incision until the phlebotomy reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and the incision to the upper parts and incise the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers laid together, or thereabouts; and let blood escape as much as you wish.
Then bind it with powders and leave it until it is healed.
And already and previously, at the beginning of the book, the incision of these and their cauterization was described.
But of the two arteries that are at the temples, bloodletting is helpful for chronic and sudden severe migraine, persistent ophthalmia, and a body flooded with acute superfluities affecting the eyes.
And the manner of bleeding them is as I have recounted to you: constrict the patient's neck tightly until the two veins appear clearly to the touch and their pulse is felt beneath your finger; and then you shall bleed with a lancet.
Then you raise the skin above the vein at the upper part with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards; and incise it as you have done the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then loosen the ligature on the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then apply a compress and powders, and bind it tightly above, and leave it until it is healed.
And now the recollection of them, and their incision, and their drawing has been preceded in the beginning of the book.
Therefore, bloodletting from the frontal vein is useful for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in chronic facial diseases, and for migraines, stiffness, and foul ulcers.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is as I recount to you; that is, that the patient constrict his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is named a fossor, of which this is the form:
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the fossor upon that vein and strike it with a hammer or other such thing in the manner of it, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you desire; and then loosen the perforation of the patient and bind it tightly until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lancet, however it is not fitting that the lancet be of a sharp point, like the other lancets, but rather of a broad point, and phlebotomize it across, because the bone is near and easily broken there by the lancet when it is thin.
But the benefit of the two veins that are at the tear ducts of the two eyes is for scabies of the eyes, for redness and swelling in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the manner of the phlebotomy is that the patient constrict his neck with a bandage, and then phlebotomize them, and you stand at his head.
And let the phlebotomy be done across its length a little with a small lancet, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the lancet is thin, its point is easily broken.
Then let the blood flow as much as is necessary to you, and place cotton there, and bind it for a night, and then unbind it.
But phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and violent headache, and for diseases of the face and migraine and redness that happens in the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient constricts his neck, and then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin lancet and insert it into the middle of the nasal bridge in a straight line, because the vein is not apparent to the touch here, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
See that you move your hand with the lancet little by little and let the blood flow according to your need; and then bind it for a night, for it is lightly restored.
But the help of phlebotomy of the two jugular veins is for constriction of the throat and the beginning of leprosy and many diseases and impetigo and bad, corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the manner of phlebotomy of these is that the patient should bind each side of his neck with a bandage; and the surgeon should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a stool.
And then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide lancet little by little; and then extract blood according to the tempered quantity or according to what you see is necessary; and then do likewise with the other vein.
And then untie the bandage and bind the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning because the wound is healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the algerich veins helps small abscesses and pustules of the mouth and corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of phlebotomy of these is that you make the patient sit before you, and bind his neck with a bandage, and then roll back his lips and look for two veins, one of which is on the right side of the lip and the second on the left; and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of each of the two, and this is more so because in the area of these are small black veins; and then incise each with a clean incision.
But if you are in doubt, and you do not know which is which, then you should incise the larger of these, and the most apparent of them.
And do the same for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of the two veins that are below the tongue, the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is appropriate for inflammations that are in the throat, for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing these is that you hold the patient between your hands facing the sun, and elevate his tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side you will see a vein and on the other side a vein, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each one; and be careful not to overuse your hand in phlebotomizing these, because below these are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those which run customarily in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways, either they are opened with a lancet or an olive-shaped fleam, with a thin point; or they are opened with a cupping knife, and this is called scarification, and this is its form:
Let its width be like this, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy is of lesser width and more subtle extremity, and is suitable for phlebotomy of thin veins that contain thin, clear blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: for it draws out blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and from that which affects the feet and abdomen.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, that he carefully guards against it and be very cautious, because beneath it lies an artery; and if he errs and is inaccurate in the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood; therefore it is necessary that he not perform this phlebotomy with a sharp fleam, but rather that it be cut with a lancet.
And if the basilic vein does not appear manifestly, then it is necessary that you leave that one and that you move to another, or that you seek one of its branches; or that you perform phlebotomy at the end of the arm instead, for that is manifest; and cut it with a lancet as we have said.
But if you wish to perform phlebotomy in the same place, then before tightening the arm you must touch the area until you know the location of the pulse, and then mark it with a pen; and then tie the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision with a lancet as we have said; and take care that the incision does not fall into the area of the artery.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place you have marked with ink, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that place.
And if you see the blood flowing in the phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is blood from the artery; and then you should quickly place your finger on it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the bleeding stops—for many times it does stop—then you tighten the arm and leave it.
And guard the patient from his movement, and let him be careful and not be angry for some days until he is healed.
But if the bleeding is not stopped, and you see that you do not have a present remedy for this, then you incise the artery, if it seems to you; because its extremity is constricted, and the blood is stopped; or take bark of a fig tree, and grind it, and take one half and press it onto the place of the vein with a descending ligature and with powder until the next day.
And then if the bleeding is stopped, good; and if not, then cure it with that which is prescribed in the remembrance of the place of the powders that stop the flow of blood.
And the stopping of his blood is difficult in many dispositions because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.
But of the dark vein, phlebotomy is helpful that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it behooves the phlebotomist that he be overly cautious in his phlebotomy, for below it is a nerve; and then if he errs in the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, stupor will befall him, and its healing is difficult, and perhaps it is never completely healed.  And this nerve often appears to the senses; and if it is hidden from some men and is subtle and is not shown, then it behooves you to use the phlebotomy instrument with which you perform phlebotomy with a slanted incision, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and provides relief for diseases of the eyes.
And it is fitting in this case, if you wish that the phlebotomist punctures with an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped fleam; for it is the safest of all veins, because neither artery nor nerve lies beneath it.
However, a small abscess forms quickly in some men when it is not phlebotomized on the first puncture, but that abscess is harmless in no way.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and for its hope and the prevention of diseases, and that phlebotomy should be performed in one of the veins that are in the elbow, that is: cephalic, median, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtime, when signs of repletion appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the third day or the first, after three hours have passed from that day.
But phlebotomy, which is administered, more when it provokes convenience and necessity for it, either by night or by day, at all hours and at all times.
And a child should not be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be phlebotomized except from the fourth month until the seventh, and the elderly who have passed sixty years should not be phlebotomized.
And if someone wants to be phlebotomized in any way, they should cleanse their bowels before phlebotomy with a clyster (enema), if they have much retained excrement in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities from the bowels during phlebotomy, which are putrid, and do not harm the principal members.
And patients with persistent nausea and diarrhea should not be phlebotomized, nor those recovering from illness or fever until they have fully recovered, nor those suffering from dropsy; and phlebotomy should be especially avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, abdominal pain, excessive sexual activity, hard labor, strenuous exercise, fasting, vigils, and any other condition that weakens the body or the vital spirits.
And carefully consider the thinning of humors beforehand if the blood is thick, with food and drink, and with medicines if that is possible for him.
And furthermore, let him enter a bath if no cause prohibits it, or let him be exercised by some exercise so that the blood is thinned.
And perform the phlebotomy in the middle of the day, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's feet are kept that day from all harmful accidents, both emotional, such as anguish, anger, fear, and physical, such as excessive work and exertion, sexual activity, and similar things.
And at his bedside, let there be present things whose use is customary among men, with aromatics and perfumes, and with balsams and similar things, according to what is possible.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be phlebotomized.
Then, the phlebotomist should extend the patient's arm and rub it two or three times with his hand; then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is too tight or too loose, it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too soft, it prevents the blood from flowing out properly.
Then, near the constriction, the one who is to be phlebotomized should rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly visible.
Then the phlebotomist should anoint his fleam (lancet) with a little old oil; and then he should place the index finger of his left hand on the vein, below the place where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein swells slightly, and the percussion is stopped because some veins, like strings, flee from the phlebotomy; and those that are full of wind, when you place the fleam on them, contract away from the fleam, and the phlebotomist gives up; and the fleam does not open the vein, and if it does, it is tight.
Therefore, the phlebotomist must be careful and attentive to all these things.
Then apply the fleam; but if the vein is not opened at once, then it is good; and if not, repeat it again a little below that spot, or above it carefully, if the area is not inflamed.
And if the area is inflamed, or the patient is frightened, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for it will quickly draw out a hot abscess, nor should he enter a bath.
Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows slowly, and you fear that you will not obtain the desired amount of blood, then repeat the phlebotomy in that same incision, straightening and widening the opening slightly, and do this carefully before the area becomes inflamed, because the area becomes inflamed in many men due to a small opening.
But if you see that it is already inflamed, then do not repeat it there, for it will not help you at all; and place on it some olive oil, for it relieves the body of blood. And olive oil is better in this instance than other oils.
Similarly, administer olive oil in every phlebotomy with which you bleed the veins to prevent the clotting of blood, and they do this with theriac and oxymel when one of these is placed on the area, because the blood is thinned and the clot is dissolved when it is thick.
And if a large abscess develops at the site of the phlebotomy, which happens many times, and especially in one who has not been bled before, or in an opening of the vein that is too small, then wait, and place on the area a sponge soaked in slightly warm salt water, and compress it for an hour, for it will dissolve it.
And it is necessary to do this immediately after the bleeding from that vein, supplementing it with another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the area for a few days, it doesn't matter; and if you wish, place on it something with dissolved aloes and myrrh, or something with mint juice or calamint or similar.
And many times abscesses and swellings occur after phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And then place your hand on it, and if then you find softness under your compression on it, then that swelling is malignant and bad; and then be careful to place on it something of what we have said, because blood will quickly flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has styptic properties, so that the area is hardened, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract blood from every man according to the quantity of his strength and according to the predominant color of the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for him who is full and strong and needs bloodletting at once, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and the phlebotomy be wide.
And in one who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary that you extract blood in several times, and that the opening be narrow.
And the best way to administer phlebotomy is that the section be transverse, not a puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safe from blood flow and nerve incision, and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to latitude and longitude.
And to whom syncope is accustomed to happen after phlebotomy, it is necessary that you treat him before phlebotomy with a little bread infused in pomegranate wine or simple heated oxymel; and extract the blood from him in three or four times.
And if there is coldness of complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread infused in syrup of myrrh or in syrup of honey flavored with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and the like, or in a very fragrant and aromatic syrup.
And if syncope happens after phlebotomy, and is caused by the loss of much blood, then he should drink meat broth and a very subtly fragrant syrup; and use aromatherapy with rue, and let his feet be bathed with it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the section on syncope due to evacuation.
And whoever wants to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time, it is necessary for him, for whom phlebotomy is for the purpose of evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he evacuate blood little by little, that is, according to the amount of strength in the following days.
But whoever wants to bleed his arm and shed his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do so approximately seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
But whoever wants to draw blood from his body away from the affected area, should be bled on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much already heated blood, and is sharp and causes fever to increase, should have blood drawn from it at once, and a large quantity should be removed, and the opening should be widened until syncope occurs, provided you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on his pulse below the place of bleeding, so that death does not result instead of syncope, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not advisable, when you want to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, that, if the opening of the vein is already closed and the exit of blood is made difficult, you press on it with vehemence and force it to be extended slightly, for this is very bad.
Having left it until it is bled a second time; or remove it with the sharpness of the phlebotomy instrument that is coagulated by the blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it theriac alfarach, or sage, and compress it with light pressure until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is abscessed, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess is healed.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed him in that same place or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "rope of the arm" is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic or basilic, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those [veins].
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient should put his hand in warm water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly.
Then it should be tightened with a bandage with moderate constriction; and then phlebotomize according to the small transversal [vein], not laterally nor lengthwise.
And let the opening be wide, and perform your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize that [vein] a little above the wrist joint.
And if the flow of blood is impeded, then you return the hand to the warm water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your need [the desired amount of bloodletting].
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from returning the hand to warm water, and the measure is to place the bowl of blood in warm water in wintertime.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all the other veins, because under it there is no pulsating vein, nor nerve.
And phlebotomy of the cephalic vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the manner of phlebotomy is that you constrict the arm with a ligature or with your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you incise it completely, it will not harm in any way.
And take care not to extend your incision too far with the phlebotomy, for beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, denuded of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water and allow the blood to flow into it, for if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be obstructed.
And when the blood has been extracted according to the necessary quantity, then place oil and salt on the vein, so that it is not quickly consolidated; and similarly you should do in every narrow branch (vein).
But the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen.
And perform the phlebotomy on him similarly as you have done on the other (patient/side).
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and for the retention of menstrual flow, and for the diseases of sores and old ulcers of the thighs and legs, and for similar diseases.
And the method of phlebotomy for him is that the patient should immerse his foot in warm water and rub it until the veins appear well; and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap; and the place of the vein appears as a small hollow below the big toe, and from it are many branched veins in the surface of the foot.
And therefore, phlebotomize the largest branch below the leg, below the ankle, near its attachment, for it is better and more healthy.
And if you phlebotomize that (vein) on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are below it on the surface of the foot, and perform your phlebotomy in such a way that you phlebotomize across, as if you wished to incise it.
And let the phlebotomy be skillful/successful.
But if the drawing of blood is prohibited, then immerse his foot in warm water and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs on the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, for the location is safe; and do not fear harming him, but beware of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same to the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
And of the sciatic vein, the location as we have said is below the heel, under the anklebone on the outer side.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for him is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient enters a bath, and quickly and tightly bind his thigh from the hip to above the ankle with a long, thin bandage, for it will not appear otherwise.
And then when it appears, then you phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you and according to the transverse vein; that is better; or incise it by incision or cut it by section, because its location is safe.
And it is very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch at all, then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one that appears on the inside of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow in the quantity that you desire.
Then loosen the binding and place a cotton cloth over the phlebotomy site and bind the area tightly, for it heals easily.
Of cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping, which is without scarification, is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And cupping glasses, which are administered with scarification and bloodletting, are applied to fourteen locations on the body, of which one location where cupping glasses are placed is at the nape of the neck, and that is the back part of the head; and the middle location, on both sides of the neck together; and cupping glasses on the chin below the jaw, below the mouth; and cupping glasses on the two shoulder blades; and cupping glasses on the hypochondrium, and that is above the end of the rib cage; and cupping glasses on the two flanks, and they are on the sides of the body; and cupping glasses on the two hips; and cupping glasses on the two thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not diminish the strength as it does with phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity requires cupping for illness or for a continuous condition, we administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at any time.
Therefore, when one sees any of these conditions, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we order cupping to be performed after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it relieves heaviness in the head and that which is settled in the eyes; but this should be after evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not permitted to use it on one who has a cold complexion, or in whom there is catarrh, for it causes great harm to such a one.
And therefore it is not fitting to use this on the elderly, and on those whose heads are afflicted with cold illnesses.
But to one upon whom this is continually done, oblivion is brought about; and therefore you should order the cupper to place his hand a little with the cupping glass at the lower parts, fearing the generation of oblivion.
But cupping with alcohol is in the place of phlebotomy of the vena fusca and the basilica vein: and for that reason it benefits asthma, and the constriction of the throat, and the rupture of an instrument of the throat (possibly referring to a throat condition or instrument), and cough, and repletion (or fullness).
And it is necessary that the alcoholic cupping glass be applied a little higher, for if it is placed lower down, it generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And cupping with *alhagdahan* (a substance whose exact nature is unclear from this text alone) benefits accidental pains in the head, and ophthalmia (eye inflammation), and migraine, and suffocation, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And it is necessary that you command the cupper that he not press his hand with scarification lest he wound the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin benefits ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar conditions of the mouth; and it stands in place of phlebotomy of the [veins] near the two lips (referring to veins in the lip area,  "aliheric" likely being a specific vein or area).
But cupping which is done above the two shoulder blades benefits against *caphatan* (a disease or condition whose exact nature is unclear from the text), which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two inner parts of the ankles benefits as much as phlebotomy of three veins, that is, the basilica, median cubital (fusca - probably a mis-spelling or variant of mediana), and cephalic veins, because it draws blood from all those smaller veins which are in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three named veins.
And command the cupper that he not proceed excessively with scarification, because the place is bare of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cupping glass with which one cups above the buttocks, and it benefits against hemorrhoids of the anus and deeper ulcers.
And it is necessary that you command the cupper that it be a large cupping glass, and that it be of brass, because the place requires strong suction; and very easily are thin cupping glasses broken and it should be scarified with scarification.
But cupping of the legs diminishes pain through evident depletion, because it draws blood from the whole body, and it benefits against old pains of the joints and of the womb, and of the bladder; and it provokes menstruation, and it benefits against swelling and dropsy; and it stands in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and of the two iliac veins.
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause syncope in many men.
And of the iliac cuppings, the benefit is similar to the benefit of cuppings of the two legs.
And the quality of the placement of the cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass initially empty and draw it by moderate suction, and do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them lightly, and remove them carefully, and that the humors come to the place by equal admixture. And do not cease to iterate this and continue until you see the place redden and swell and the redness of the blood appear.
And then you scarify and iterate the suction little by little, and then consider the disposition of the humors.
Because that man who has tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once and no more, lest the place be ulcerated.
And command the cupper to amplify the scarification and make it a little deeper, and temper the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary that you scarify twice, for in the first time the way of thinning is opened to the blood and its watery part. But in the second [scarification], to the refined extraction of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then let a third scarification be done so that it achieves the desired result.
Finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, one scarification is enough for us.
And if we want extraction of much blood, we make many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that we scarify with a deep scarification.
And the term scarification in which [the depth is] only that of the elbow.  (This likely refers to the depth of the cut, comparing it to the width or depth of an elbow.)
And if the one whose elbow is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places for the cupping glasses be anointed with lenitive, aperitive, and resolutive ointments; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil, or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or blood [oil], and similar things.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balm mint oil, or aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar things.
But if the patient has large pores and tender flesh, then the use of oil should be prohibited, and for such a person the places for cupping should be washed with rosewater, or with cold water of nightshade, or with poppy water, or with water of borrage, and similar things.
And the one whose blood is of much humidity, wash his cupping places with sour wine, or with myrtle and sumac water, and similar things.
And for the one whose superfluities are thick, wash his cupping places with old wine, or with water of sanicle (self-heal), which is marjoram, or with a decoction of anise, or of chamomile, and similar things.
And the cupping should be done before the bath; rather, it should be administered about an hour or two before the bath, and he should sleep after the cupping.
What is it that the person to be cupped or bled ought to observe before cupping?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the one to be cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp blood and inflammation, then he should take cooling things, such as sour pomegranates, and endive in sour wine, and lettuce, and dried hemp, and julep, and similar things.
And give him foods such as chicken, and meats of domestic birds, and foods seasoned with acids, and the like.
And for one whose complexion is cold, he should drink syrup of mallow, or syrup of hemp seed, and sumac, and very fragrant wine, midway between old and new; and let him be advised to use little drink and food, and give him foods such as chicken, hemp seed, peas, small birds, and pigeons.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, his drink should be greater than his food.
And it is necessary that at certain times some men be given theriac alpharac, or medicines of musk, that is, nutmeg, or zedoary before cupping or before bloodletting, or nearby, so that the principal members are strengthened and the blood is thinned; and they should not take those things warm.
But the cuppings that are without scarification should be cuppings that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen and gout, and on the navel, in the places of the knees, and the groin, because these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
And it is not desired for these but the attraction of blood from a member, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in the illness of a blood flow from the nose; and we use this so that cold, invisible flatulence from the member is dissolved, just as we place it on the belly and navel; for this rarefies the member and warms it and reduces the pain because it resolves flatulence.
And it is placed on the throat when it suffers from obstruction or swelling, for by virtue of strong attraction it quickly opens the obstruction and eradicates the swelling from its place.
And similarly it acts when it is placed on the liver and spleen because of flatulence enclosed within them.
And these cuppings are administered empty with suction alone; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of tepid water in diseases of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and is larger; that is, with hot water alone or with water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Method of applying a fire cupping glass: let the width of the opening be two fingers, as we have formed it; and the length of the cup be half a palm; and let it be on the patient's side, in the area that is in the circumference, half of it; the hole should be small enough for only a needle to enter it.
Let it be made of bronze, copper, or citrine, with thick edges, smooth, even, and polished so that it does not injure the limb because of its position on it.
And let there be a transverse bar of bronze or iron in the middle of it, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And let this cupping glass be larger than the one we have described; and a smaller one, depending on the illness and the age of the patient.
And the cupping glasses for infants and the weak are different from the cupping glasses for youths and those of robust physiques.
And the way to place this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to extend the wick with a decent wood fire in front of a small wax candle, and place it on the middle of the transverse bar in the center of the cupping glass, so that the fire is lit around the part underneath so that the patient's body is not burned.
Then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be on the hole we have mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glasses and do not need to remove the finger and let the vapor escape through that hole, then the cupping glass will immediately be loosened.
And then ignite the wick according to its method, and repeat it if you need to.
But in cupping, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse bar or hole, and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and it is placed on the limb only.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better it is, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leech application is not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs where the placement of cupping glasses is not possible due to their small size, such as the ear and gums and similar; or on a limb devoid of flesh, such as a finger and nose and similar.
And the quality of using those is that you should find leeches in fresh, clean, stagnant waters.
And then let them be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and so that no substance remains in their bellies; and then let the body be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and cupping; and then rub the patient's limb until it reddens; and then they should be applied to it.
And when they are full and fall off.
And if it is possible to draw blood from the area with a cupping glass, it is more beneficial afterwards.
And if not, then wash the area with wine vinegar and then with plenty of water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged near the placement of the leeches, and it oozes, then you dip a cloth in cold water, and place that on top until the oozing stops.
And if the bleeding is excessive, then sprinkle crushed vitriol, or gallnuts and similar styptic substances, on it until the bleeding stops; or place halved, scorched beans on the area and leave them until the beans adhere to the area and the bleeding stops.
And it is necessary, if needed, to reiterate the application of leeches, when it is possible to change those.
And if the leeches are prevented from attaching, then rub the area with fresh blood or prick the area with a needle until blood comes out; and then apply them, for when they sense any blood they immediately attach.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little crushed aloes, or salt, or ash on them, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: On Restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
O, son, know that foolish and common physicians boast of this chapter, those who have never looked at the books of the Ancients or read a single letter from them.
And for this reason, this skill of the learned in our land is kept private; and I have never forgotten this at any time; and I have not acquired this except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and studying their understanding, until I extracted their knowledge.
And then I dedicated myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter everything that my knowledge contains and on which my experience is based; since I have abridged it for you and freed it from lengthy discussion; and I have shortened it for the sake of brevity; and I have explained it clearly; and I have shown many forms of instruments that are used in this, as is done by way of explanation, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
Summary and collections from the essence of bone fractures, from those whose premise is necessary, before we begin the recollection of fractured and diverse members, each one by itself. Therefore, I will say in the prologue of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters to the understanding of which, at the beginning, the artisan is obliged and based on the truth of those things; that is, you and those who are ready to know or learn this noble art, besides yourselves.
And therefore I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall happens to someone, then you should begin with phlebotomy or purging, or both together, if no cause prohibits it, such as weakness of virtue, or if the one to whom it happened is an infant, or an old person in decrepitude, or it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
And then let him be content with a diet of cold herbs and the meat of birds and rabbits; and we prohibit thick meats and filling oneself with foods and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are sure of a hot abscess, and if you do not fear effusion of matter to the limb.
And then return the patient to his former regime with which he is accustomed.
And so, as the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient should be fed nutritious foods, very thick and heavy foods in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads [possibly referring to a type of grain or seeds], and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and things similar to those, and with this regime, the coagulation of the fracture is made more easily and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in their first youth and in the decrepit, cannot be rejoined and consolidated according to their nature because of the desiccation of their limbs.
But however, nature adjusts and applies to the broken bone from every part some substance similar to glue, in which there is thickness that adheres and binds it until they are together glued and bound together, until they come to the end of strength and firmness, just like fire in the beginning, until no cause prevents it from its work.
And for this reason it is necessary that you give the patient foods in which there is weight, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, because a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the bone of the foot is different from a fracture of the bone of the arm; and similarly all the other limbs are different from one another.
And I, coming with a remembrance of every type of fracture, expounded in its own chapter distinct from the others.
Many diversities of fracture in itself. And the types of bone fracture are diversified in themselves; for there is an arcuate fracture besides those which happen in the stars (perhaps meaning splintering); and sometimes a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and so are the fractures of the shaft and splinters and additions proceeding and non-proceeding, just as is done in the quill when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And to each type there is its own art or torment in its restoration, as will be its remembrance distinctly in its place (in its own section/chapter).
Many signs of bone fracture. And by this a bone fracture is known: its crookedness, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and it is of it when we press it with one's hand.
And therefore when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor is it made evident by your touching when you touch the bone with agitation and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
Having said this, it is possible that there is a crookedness or small fissure, where it is not fitting that you move it with your hand and with total compression; having said that, place on it the medicines of which mention is made near this point which pertains to the location; and then it should be held tightly by a subtle bandage.
And know that if the place is bent and not split in two, or other such thing does not happen to it suddenly, as if the whole part is torn from its counterpart, then you must begin at your earliest opportunity the rectification of it before an abscess occurs there.
And if a hot abscess occurs there, then leave it for a few days until the abscess ceases; and then treat it according to whatever method you can of lightness and ingenuity.
And know that the restoration and healing of it is easier than of a bone in which a sudden injury has occurred.
And then tighten it according to the indication/remembrance of it. (Meaning:  tighten the bandage or dressing as needed, following the instructions/observations made previously).
But if the bone is injured, then extension of that broken limb from two parts is necessary, if it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two cords or with one cord and your hand.
And let your position be such that you place the injured limb in a position according to its natural form, while the broken parts of the limb are extended; then it is necessary that you return those additions with skill and in whatever way you can to their places.
And take care, according to your strength, that no pain or injury befalls the patient because of your operation; and it is necessary, according to your ability, that you apply one bone to the other, its counterpart, according to their best forms (or natural alignment).
And it is necessary that at that time you skillfully touch that with your hand, and if you see anything amiss there, rectify it and adjust it to the best of your ability.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, as many foolish physicians do, who often cause a hot abscess through their operation, or cause contraction in the limb, as we have seen happen through their operation many times.
And the nature of the binding of the quieted limb is that which I recount; so that you may know that broken limbs are diversified in their smallness and in their largeness and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the penis and similar to those, then the bandage should be of very fine soft cloth.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, it is necessary that in those there be a wide and firm bandage, because the wide bandage connects the large limb and binds it on all sides with even pressure, so that no blemish enters it.
Then begin, after your equalization evacuation, to place a bandage suitable for this, over the place of the fracture, with three or four layers depending on what the limb requires; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
And then come with that to the highest part of the fracture site, and tighten less than you did your binding with which you bound the fracture site. And then lengthen the bandage from the fracture site a little, and loosen the binding little by little, until you reach a large part of the area.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with a bandage, and then come with the bandages to the lowest part of the fracture; and let your work be in the tightening of the bandage and in the loosening of it according to what we have said in the first bandage above.
And then place between the bandages some lion's wool or cloth with which the crookedness of the fracture is padded, if there is crookedness; and if not, do not place anything there.
And then place another bandage over it, and then apply over these bandages suitably made splints immediately, if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the area, and then apply to it what drains the abscess and reduces the inflammation; and leave that for a few days; and then you tighten the splints over it.
And let the splints be of half a reed, smooth and cleverly shaped; or let them be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint that is placed over the fracture be a little thicker and smoother than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to what is appropriate to the limb in size; and then tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then bind over it with thread suitably according to what we have said of tightening, and it is that your tightening should be according to the place of the fracture itself, and the further it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the practice of some foolish people placing their threads of twisted rope, and this is a great error, when the tightening lacks uniformity.
And similarly, very fine threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with those what you want by tightening, and it is not suitable that there be less than a finger's breadth between splint and splint.
And if the patient is harmed by the ends of the splints near the binding in those places, then place under those some carded flax or wool until that does not cause him injury.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and there is a rupture in the bone, and I will come to the recollection of that in the following chapter according to its particularity.
And know that not every broken limb is bound with splints on the first day; the reason for this is that, when the limb is large, you should not place splints on it until approximately five or seven days, or more, according to your assessment of the risk of a hot abscess forming.
And this is the manner of the plasters with which the Ancients restored [injuries], which are placed on fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
Method of a common plaster, a shortening of the restoration of fractures, suitable for many constitutions and especially for women and children, because it is something which neither heat nor cold overcomes: and that is to take the powder of the mill, which is the pith of the flour that hangs from the movement of the millstone on the walls of the mill.
And make it like this, except that you sift it with egg white, and make the confection neither thick nor thin; and use it in this way.
Another method of a plaster restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take of asafoetida, of ladanum, of acacia, of elecampane, and of megrach (which is the root of wild pomegranate), of each one dram (x); of myrrh and aloe, five drams (v); of aloes, twenty drams (xx); all are to be crushed, sifted, and mixed with aloe water or with egg white if the patient's constitution is hot; and use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores slightly broken bones, and benefits many men.
Another method of a plaster which benefits fractures and sprains: take of megrach and of white mallow, ten drams (x); of myrrh and of aloe, five drams (v); of acacia, six drams (vi); of Armenian bole, twenty drams (xx).
All are to be crushed in a mortar with much grinding, and sifted, and made into a confection with water or with egg white and applied.
Method of a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and if pain occurs in these and in fissures and fractures: let soiled wool be taken and submerged in sour wine and cooked oil and placed on the area.
However, this plaster does not have restorative virtue; it rather draws out hot abscesses and expels pain.
Another method of a plaster that restores a broken bone: take fresh fig leaves and wild poppy leaves; pound everything and make a plaster of them.
Method of a brief plaster administered for the restoration of a bone fracture and when you desire resolution of the remainder of an abscess: take roots of marshmallow, of chamomile, and violet flowers, of pea flour, of all an equal part; let all be crushed and made into a confection with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then make this confection with moist coriander water or with water and use it.
Another method of a stronger plaster in resolution than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of the limb: take roots of marshmallow and linseed, and of pomegranate, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, of all an equal part; let all be crushed and made into a confection with willow water or with fresh water or with wine, all this according to the quality of the limb and the condition of its color.
But Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommends that it be middling between thickness and thinness.
But in Gaul it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb during its restoration, and the things which are drying with little heat are thus, like myrrh, incense, and similar to those things which we have mentioned.
Method of a plaster to apply to injury and pain: take millet, of wax, of shaved human hair or bird down, and of marshmallow, and salt, equal parts; let them be crushed and sifted and made into a confection, and let a plaster be made.
But the amount of time the bandage should remain and then be loosened is this: consider if no pain or itching has occurred, and the bone is not broken or dislocated, then you do not loosen it for many days. And if vehement pain or itching or inflammation occurs at the place, then immediately loosen or untie it at that hour, and remove the plaster from it.
And take linen cloth and a moist sea sponge, and submerge that in lukewarm water, and with that wash the area until that itching ceases and the pain is calmed; and then let the limb rest for an hour; and then place over it clean wool submerged in sharp wine and oil or rose oil, and bind it on for a night until you are sure of a hot abscess, and that the inflammation of the limb is reduced, and its pain is lessened.
And then repeat that thin bandage and small plaster and do not tighten it as much as your first constriction, but refine it with that until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess, and the redness, and the pain, and the inflammation, and all the symptoms are now completely reduced, and you judge there is no need for plaster or bandage, then you repeat that as you did at the beginning, equally.
And if none of the conditions we have mentioned occur in the limb, then do not untie it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days, depending on what appears to you from the loosening of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and approaches the coagulation of the flesh over it.
And then adjust the bandage more tightly than your first bandage, and adjust it to the thickening of the patient's flesh, as the recovery of the patient proceeds.
But if you see the site of the fracture drying and thinning more than is appropriate, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it; and therefore moisten it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it; and let this be done every three days; and loosen the bandage a little, and by this operation nourishment will return to the limb, and it will heal easily.
But what foolish restorers of a fractured limb do, when it is not set correctly at the beginning, as it should be, and is set crookedly, is an error in their operation, and a great danger, and if this were correct, the Ancients would have enlarged upon it in their books and would have worked with it.
And I have not seen anyone among them do this, wherefore it is more reasonable that you not do it.
Chapter Second: Of a fracture when it happens in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow from a sword, and the blow breaks all the bone into chips, which are below the bone, as happens in a staff, and for this reason this type is called *ascial*; or the sword cuts a part of the bone, and cuts its flesh and does not penetrate to the back of it; and this type of fracture is called *levatio absoluta*.
And the wound of these two fractures is either large or small, and of a fracture which is a contusion or attrition; and its cause is a blow with a stone or a fall on a stone, and the like.
And this fracture is either penetrating, almost reaching the pannicle which is below the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the wound of these two fractures is either large or small.
And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone, as fine as a small hair, and for this reason this type is called a capillary fracture.
And there is a fracture which is caused either by a fall or by a blow from a stone and the like, which causes some lamina of the bone to enter the inner parts, and is made in a concave place, as happens to the edges of a ram when a blow is struck and a part of it is driven inwards.
And this happens especially in the bodies of moist bones, such as the skulls of children.
And in all these types of comminuted fractures, the pieces are like separated stars. And I will return everything to its place with repositioning.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by probing them and by inquiring about them with probes, and by the presence of corrupted flesh that is over them.
And a hairline fracture is known because it is uncovered on the bone, and is wiped clean, and is touched with a probe, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of fractures, consider first the patient's symptoms, and then if you see by the symptoms that signify by manifest indication a danger, such as vomiting of bile, and stretching out, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and swelling of the eyes and redness of them, and similar symptoms in the most dangerous conditions, it is without doubt not healed.
And if you see no unusual symptoms you expect healing, then you begin his treatment.
The reason is that if the injured person comes to you at the beginning as injured, and this is in the winter days, then it is necessary that you study the condition of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you try to set the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone is corrupted by the panniculus (tissue), and that the symptoms that we have recounted occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the pannicle covering the brain, and is with small fragmented pieces and attrition, then it is necessary that you incise the comminuted and atrited part, as I shall recount to you.
And it is that you shave the head of the injured patient, and uncover the bone according to custom and manner as much as possible according to the nature of the wound, and that it be light on the patient.
And if you encounter during the uncovering of the bone,  a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then you oppose it with what is necessary, and that is to fill the place with cloths infused in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess is subsided, and you are sure of the flow of blood; and then begin with the circling of the bone and its removal.
And this should be according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow incisor, and this is its form:  And then administer another incisor like this, a little wider than that one; and this is its form:
And then administer yet another, wider incisor than the second.
And it is necessary that you have a number of different incisors, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others and are sharpened at the ends, and are made of Indian iron or steel.
And use them easily with percussion on the incisor so that you do not strike the head and injure it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary that you perforate its circumference before you administer the incisors with the drills, which are called shallow drills.
And they are not called so except because those do not reach the limit of the skull bone to that which is near it, because the drill has a round end or edge on that which is below its sharp head, similar to an edge or small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each of which suits the thickness of each bone, until you have present in all parts of the skull an end which is sharp, the quantity in length and shortness being according to the quantity of thickness of that bone.
And this is the form of three types of drills: The method of perforating the circumference of the broken bone is that you place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone is penetrated; and then move the drill to another place, and place that which is between each hole the size of the radius or thereabouts.
And then incise with incisors that which is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as you can in order to lighten it, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument which you will have prepared for this purpose, such as fine tongs and forceps.
And it is necessary that you take great care that the incisor does not touch anything of the brain.
And so, when you have encircled the bone by drilling, and it is separated from the brain if it is continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and smooth its roughness with another instrument similar to an incisor, but however it is necessary that it be finer and more delicate than the other incisors.
And if some small and splintered bone fragments remain, then take them away easily with whatever instrument you have; and then treat the wound with lint and ointments which we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is easier, far from fear, which Gualia describes and praises highly; and this is his account: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin to uncover the part of the bone at the place where the fracture is most severe and most evident, until, when you have uncovered that part and have placed under it the end of that slow and gentle incisor of which this is the form:
And it is so that the lenticular part is broad and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is split in two lengthwise, like a wedge; so that the lenticular part is fitted to the brain with its face, the sharp part entering into the bone.
And then strike the incisor on one side with a small mallet until you cut all the bone easily as it is curved, and you are sure of the periosteum that no accident happens to it in any way, even if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and even if he were sleeping.
Then if any matter attached to the bone remains in the periosteum in some part of the bone, cut that away with the lenticular end of that incisor, and remove it easily, for it is removed without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the periosteum, and what is cut off or removed from the bone is its surface, and there remain roughness and fine splinters, then you must rasp away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number, of various sizes, so that it is possible for you to use at each place the most suitable and the most appropriate of them according to how your operation proceeds on that broken bone and its shape.
And you must proceed in your rasping of the bone, beginning with the broadest of those rasps, and then gradually use the finer ones, and do not cease to do this continuously until you come to use the finest and subtlest of all those.
But in each of the other small, hair-like fractures and subtle fractures, you must administer care according to what you are doing to rectify them.
And it is a matter that is not hidden from all those who have studied in that art. And this is what we have written and shown regarding large fractures.
And if the panniculus (flesh) is retracted when you rasp the bone, then you must take a linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound; and then take another doubled or tripled cloth and immerse it in wine and rose oil and place this over the thin cloth, and do this as lightly as possible, so as not to burden the wound; and then apply a linen bandage over that, and do not tighten it except enough to hold only the wound.
And leave it with this dressing for a day or two until you are sure of a hot abscess; and then untie it and apply medicines with which there is superfluous dryness, such as flaxseed, barley flour,  powder of lentils and birthwort, and things similar to those.
And it is so that you make a powder of these medicines to be sprinkled on the wound, once they are dry; and universally, apply to it any medicine whose property it is to cleanse and not bite (i.e., cause further irritation).
And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clean; and that there be no dirt of ointment or anything else; nor allow any virulence to gather there; for when it is applied to the panniculus (flesh) of the brain, it corrupts and rots it, and this evil brings about malignant illness to the patient.
And it causes harm to the wound of the head, as the bone is denuded of its covering, and especially when its care is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, if the patient suffers the accidents that we have described, know that it is perilous without doubt.
And if there is blackness not from the medicine that is placed on top, but it is in the virtue of that medicine that produces that blackness, then you must take one part honey and three parts of rose oil, and with these, moisten a cloth, and then place this on the wound; and then treat it with the healing remedies that are appropriate until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken except in two parts together, or one of those, at certain times, because in it there are two bones, for the lower part is cartilaginous, and is not broken and does not suffer except attrition, crookedness, and sinuosity (deviation).
But if one of its two parts is broken, then you must insert your little finger into their nose, and that you align that fracture inside with your index finger, and with the thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with ease, and be careful that you do not cause the patient pain through your operation.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it must be set with the end of a thin rod.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same for both.
And take care with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the seventh or tenth day you should treat the resulting abscess with cautery.
And then insert into the end of the nose a small roll of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part, or place two small wedges, if the fracture is in two parts, and let the wedges be of sufficient size to fill the nasal opening.
And some of the ancient restorers said that the wedges should be soaked in a medicated paste and changed daily, but I have not seen this done; rather, it is necessary that the linen roll be soaked in egg white mixed with finely ground powder; and then leave the wedge in place until the bone is set and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a wedge, a goose feather, wrapped in linen cloth, is inserted into the nose; and this is done if the nasal fracture is severe and the patient's breathing is not impeded.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, use wedges.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, dress the nose with a plaster or lint soaked in sour wine and rose oil, or with diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to plaster that area externally with sesame flour and cooked linseed powder mixed with egg white; and then place linen cloth over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the nasal bones are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted, then it is necessary to make an incision over them, and extract them with instruments suitable for this; and then sew the incision, and treat it with what promotes granulation and consolidation, and with plasters suitable for this.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with wedges and administer lead canulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
On the restoration of the mandible when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe then if the fracture is only external and is not broken in two and is bent inwards at the parts, then its diagnosis is easy.
And it is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is in the left mandible, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with it the hump of the fracture inwards, towards the outer parts, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; thus properly equalizing it.
And if the fracture of the mandible is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from two parts according to straightness until its equalization is possible.
And if there is concussion of teeth with disruption, then strengthen those which you hope will remain with a thread of gold or silver or silk; and then place over the broken jaw a cerate, and then place over it a doubled cloth, and place over the cloth a well-made large splint, or a piece of wood equal to the length of the mandible; and then bind that over it according to how the binding is prepared for you and as the application requires, until it is healed.
And instruct the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him food of sorbitive lions.  (Note: "Sorbitive lions" is likely a mistranslation or archaic term.  It probably refers to a type of easily digestible food or broth).
And if you estimate that the shape is already altered in any way, then you should examine it and unbind it on the third day; and then rectify that which is already altered and plaster it with powdered barley, with egg white, or with starch, after you have removed the cerate from it, and place wool over the plaster.
And then, since the plaster is attached and adjusted to it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not unbind it until it is healed and strengthens the fracture; for many times this fracture is healed in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer that which we have said many times in its sedation until it is healed, and that abscess is softened.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of the bone is separated or splintered; then you should carefully remove those splinters with what is appropriate for that in the removal of them from the wound.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a fleam according to your needs.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then you sew the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters that is suitable for it and heals it, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken.
Often the clavicle is broken in the front part above the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore; or it is so that splinters are present, and it is difficult to restore; or it is so that the fracture is accompanied by a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the fractured clavicle in place, and the other extends the neck towards that area.
Then align the fracture with your fingers until its form is as it should be, and there is neither too much prominence nor concavity.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a roll of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to your need; and extend and elevate the clavicle and compress the roll with your hand until you align the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle to the outer parts, because it has reached the acromion, then it is necessary that the patient lie supine on their neck, and you place a moderately sized cushion on their muscle.
And the assistant presses the muscle downwards until the bone of the clavicle that is on the acromion is elevated, and then you rectify the fracture and align it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the clavicle and they are jagged, then you should incise over it and extract those splinters easily.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you make an incision with one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the clavicle the instrument that serves as a support; and this instrument is of wood or iron, of which this is the form:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
But its length should be as long as is possible for you in the operation; let it have two ends like a fork, and one end be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and there is danger of a hot abscess, then you should approximate the two lips of the wound with suture.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound opening.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in sour wine and rose oil and wine, and apply it there.
And ensure that the splint is not displaced from the broken bone; therefore, you must see the patient each day. If the bandage is loosened or you see that the splint has shifted, then you must correct this and tighten the binding.
Then place the patient's pillow under their neck, and place a small cushion under their testicles at night on top of the pillow; so that by this means the injured area is elevated, and thus the fractured collarbone is raised relative to the muscle; or their arm is bound to their neck.
And do not loosen the bandage unless an abscess or severe inflammation occurs at the site, until twelve days have passed.
Then renew the plaster if you see the need, and adjust the binding, restoring it, and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone is healed and consolidated.
And it is strengthened and healed, according to the condition, in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
On the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is broken on its lateral side, and not shattered, only the edges are broken.
And so when the shoulder blade is broken—and it is broken in the middle of the shoulder blade—and is not known except by touch, then according to the nature of the fracture, forcefully prepare it and reduce it to its natural shape in every way possible to you.
Then place on the area powdered finely ground egg white and lion's wool; then apply a poultice of doubled cloth; then place over it a thin linen bandage, according to the size of the whole shoulder blade or a little more.
But if the bandage is concave in any place on the shoulder blade, then you fill that concavity with lion's wool, and then tighten the bandage evenly.
Then bind it tightly above with a long bandage, with a decent constriction and firmness of the bandage until it is not moved from its place.
And examine the bandage each day; and every time it is loosened, bind it again and tighten it, and adjust the bandage if it has moved from its place.
And have the patient lie on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five.
And so when this number is complete, then you unbind the bandage, and you should know for sure that it is from the bones of which the beginning is not feared nor their dissolution.
And if it proceeds from the location of the fractured bone and you place it under the bandage, then you incise over it, and remove it, and act as we have said in the fracture of the clavicle concerning the treatment of a hot abscess if this occurs.
Chapter 7.
On the restoration of a fractured foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this happens slowly; but its extremities break much more quickly, being crushed and comminuted.
And among the accidents [complications] when the middle of the foot is broken is that it inclines inward, and great pain occurs, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and a strong fever and vomiting blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is apparent and not hidden from feeling.
And its restoration is that the patient should be supine on his back, and a cushion placed between his shoulders; and then press on his muscles, and adjust his bones with the hands on both sides, and be skillful in the operation and in the setting, in every way possible and appropriate, until the bone returns to its proper shape.
Then place a plaster and lint over it, and place over this a thin splint of willow or alder, or something similar in lightness, after you wrap it in cloth; and then be skillful in binding this over the broken bone so that it is not loose; and use a bandage in a circular fashion around the dorsum sometimes, and tighten it with a decent constriction; and then check the bandage frequently, and tighten it when it loosens.
And if necessity demands loosening of the bandage because of corrosion or itching, or pain, or an abscess that occurs in the area, then examine and unbind it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has happened by appropriate treatment; and then reapply the plaster, if the situation requires it; and adjust the bandage until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs occurs only in the thicker parts, where there are two; and in their extremities, in the anterior part, no injury occurs because they are cartilaginous. And its recognition is not hidden from perception through its examination with the fingers.
And the restoration should be thus: align the fracture with the fingers as much as possible, until it is aligned as needed, and then apply a plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if that is necessary.
And if the fracture of the ribs is towards the inner parts, then the patient experiences vehement pain and a stabbing sensation, like the stabbing pain that occurs in someone with pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane; and it causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And the Ancients were ingenious in this with many devices.
And of them it is said: it is necessary that you give the patient foods that produce inflation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and extended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we avoid this so that it does not lightly cause a hot abscess, if it does not already exist; and if it does exist, then it already helps with that.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on top and that it should draw strongly; and this seems reasonable, but however, it is feared that the cupping glass will draw superfluities to the place because of the weakness.
And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is even as it wraps around that roundness; and then the patient should be treated with a treatment for pleurisy, with diet and medicine.
And if a vehement cause constricts the patient, which he cannot bear, and the bone pierces the membrane with a painful puncture, and we fear for the patient, then it is necessary that we make an incision over the place, uncovering the broken rib, and then place over it an instrument that preserves the lung, the remembrance of which has been previously mentioned, and that we cut the bone easily, and extract it.
And then we should join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitching, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then you should take and pour powders into rose oil and place it on the place, and the patient should be treated with what is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him lie supine on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and later it leads to their attrition, and similarly to the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider this: if you see his hands already softened, stupefied, and dead, and he cannot move them, extend them, or clench them, and when you constrain them with your hands or prick them with a needle and he feels no pain in them, then know that he will not be healed, and in most dispositions, it is mortal.
And if he moves them and feels constriction in them with the hands and puncture, then know that the marrow of the bone is saved and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see in the vertebrae of the neck something similar to that and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider his feet.
Then, if you see that they are already softened, that which happened to the hands happens to the feet, and further, when he lies on his back, he experiences flatulence and excretion without his will, and sometimes he is lying on his back and wants to urinate but cannot, then know that it is mortal, and then do not labor in his cure.
But if none of those things happen, the cause is better and lighter.
And his cure is that you should make a perforation for the sedation of the hot abscess, that you place on the afflicted vertebra, only pure rose oil, or with boiled egg yolks; place that on it several times a day until the hot abscess is sedated.
And then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, and bind it tightly; and command the patient to use rest and tranquility and that he not sleep on the side where he finds pain until he is healed.
And if it happens that because of the attrition of the bone splinters or some part that is already separated from it, then it is necessary that you dry the wound and remove that bone; and then approximate the two lips of the wound, with sutures if it is large; and then treat it with some incarnative ointment until it is healed.
But if the back part of the hip bone is broken, and it is the end of the coccyx, then it is necessary that you insert the index finger of your left hand into the anus, and that you adjust the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible according to the second articulation; and then place a plaster and bandage on it, if you have any of those, and then bind it tightly.
And if you feel broken splinters in it, then you should probe that area, and remove them, and treat the wound with the treatment that has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the hip.
The hip bones are rarely broken, and if they are broken, then their fracture is only a separation at the extremities of those bones and they are broken lengthwise and lean inwards; and the patient experiences pain and throbbing in the area, and the leg is numb when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you bind that according to what is prepared for you by equalization, binding until it is similar to its natural form.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or it leans downwards, then you make the patient lie on their stomach so that the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And then when you have bound it, place a plaster over it, and then place a splint of wood or whalebone over that, and tighten it with a bandage over which you do not fear puncture of the fracture or movement of the splint.
And bind the concavity with something that fills it until it takes the bandage according to its equality, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease the extension of it and its restoration until the hot abscess is settled, and place on it that which settles it as has been described before; and then return to its restoration, and bind it as is necessary.
And if it happens that the bones are jagged or comminuted, then you pull them out.
Chapter 11.
Of the restoration of a fractured humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the hip and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a wooden splint of moderate thickness according to this form:
And let two bandages be tied at its two extremities, and then let it be suspended from a raised position.
And place the patient on a seat; and then place their broken arm on the splint until it reaches the armpit, in the middle of which the curvature of the splint should be attached.
And then suspend some heavy object from it, or the assistant extends it downwards; and then the physician should set the fracture with his hands, until the fracture is properly reset.
And the other method is that the patient lies supine on their back, and suspend the arm from their neck with a bandage; and then order two assistants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with their hands; and the other hold the lower part; and each of them extend to their part.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you tighten it above the fracture with a bandage and above that with another bandage, and each of the two assistants extend to their two parts.
And so if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the armpit and the other below the fracture near the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed on that spot and on that elbow.
Swallow that with ease and without effort, and then when it is swallowed as it should be and is applied with good application, then tighten it unless a hot abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the constriction until the seventh day, and place on it soiled wool soaked in sour wine and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you tighten that.
And the way to tighten it is to place a plaster over the fracture, and then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm on that support, and place your open hand over their muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the arm on the support so that the arm is in a stellate position, unless some cause of the broken bone prevents this.
And then use splints.
And it is that you place over the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is that your bandage over the place of the fracture should be tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be.
And so if you see the placement of the splints and the bandage as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you do [the procedure].
And if you fear a festering abscess, then you leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then observe the bandage in all parts for three days so that swelling or inflammation does not occur at the site; or it is forbidden for food to reach the limb due to the tightness of the bandage; and then rectify all this according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not untie the bandage until after three days or more.
And let the patient's sleeping position be on their side, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place over the injury a poultice full of wool, evenly distributed, and check every hour of the night and day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or dissolved, or that the bandage is not softened; therefore, rectify all this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order which we have previously mentioned, so that the food is light at the beginning until he starts to recover strength; and then it is fitting to increase his food.
For it is customary for the injured limb and his leg to be bandaged for forty days; and then it is necessary that they be unbound and a bath be administered, and that it be medicated with ointments which rectify that.
And if the fracture is badly damaged, then you should not unbind the bandage and splints from that for ten days or for up to two months.
Chapter 12.
On the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two focils; of which one is small, and it is that which is next to the little finger, and the other is large and it is that which is placed below the small finger, on the lower side.
And very easily the larger bone is broken alone, or the smaller one, and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small bone is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the bone is broken below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller bone above, then it is convenient for the physician, after its restoration, that he apply slight extension easily until it is aligned.
But if it is the large bone that is broken, then it is necessary to apply a stronger extension.
And if both bones are broken together, then you must apply the extension much more strongly.
And it is necessary that you place the shape of your hand during its restoration and its extension stretched out on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be on the upper parts, higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be lying on a flat couch.
And let there be a cushion in front of him at his height or level, so that the patient does not suffer discomfort.
Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant extend it from above similarly.
Then the physician should manipulate the bone until he reduces it to the best possible position.
And if in the fracture of the bone there is a jagged break, then you must forcefully return all the pieces to their place with your skill.
And if a separated, jagged piece appears that is detached and you have no hope of restoring it, then you should saw it off and remove it according to the method which we have described above.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already dealt with this in a separate chapter, and therefore take care of it accordingly.
And if an abscess occurs early in your treatment, then you should apply a cloth with a plaster made of rose oil and white wax, of moderate consistency, neither too thick nor too thin, and bind the cloth tightly over it until the abscess subsides; and then remove the plaster and apply a poultice prepared from fine powder with egg white, and then apply a bandage; and let the bandage that is applied over the fracture be firmer and tighter.
And know that the number of bandages on the arm varies depending on the circumstances, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones at once.
Then apply your bandage over the fracture site firmly and tightly, and where the bandage is over the parts above the fracture or the parts below it, apply the bandage a little more loosely, as was mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not hard or rough, and the thread with which it is bound should be of medium thickness, neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have already recommended.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any problem arises that requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb, then you should bathe the limb with warm water until the itching stops.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the fracture is now softened and the bone is healed and similar to the others, then correct everything with your skill.
And consider further whether nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the bandage, for then you must loosen it a little and leave it so for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient does not experience any of the problems we have mentioned, then the bandage should not be loosened for about twenty days or thereabouts.
And then the patient's hand should be suspended by its own power of movement, and make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or very quickly in twenty-eight days, and all this depends on the constitution and the strength of the patient.
Chapter 13.
On the restoration of a fracture of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures rarely happen in the wrist and finger knuckles; instead, they often suffer attrition (wear and tear).
And when a fracture or attrition occurs in the hand, then the patient should lie down and place a cushion in front of him, evenly, and then place his hand on the extended cushion.
Then the assistant extends the broken bones, and the physician joins them until they are properly set with a good union.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, unless a hot abscess is present; and then apply a bandage over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the inner parts of the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball of cloth, and instruct the patient to grasp it with their fractured hand; then let it be bound tightly with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be of leather with cloth in which it is softened, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tighten it as necessary.
But if the fracture is in the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a bandage above and another bandage below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the splint, as the hand is placed on the splint between the fingers with bandages.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be bandaged as necessary and then bound to the palm; and if you wish, place a small, straight splint on it so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or the index finger, or the ring finger, or the little finger, then it should be bandaged and tied to the finger next to it; or all should be tied together consecutively, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and alongside that, the disposition of a hot abscess and oppose — with your operation — what is necessary when any of these things occur, according to how it is described.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and is felt according to whether it is broken in the front part or the upper part.
And its restoration is done in this way: a bandage is tightened above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on their stomach and face.
Then the physician extends the entire bandage to its proper place, according to the nature of the fracture, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the hip joint, then let the bandage be close to the knee on the side of the patella, so that the extension pulls upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the knee, then let the bandage be placed near the knee, and let the extension be in the parts below.
Then the physician aligns the bone with both his hands until he reduces it to its natural form and the bone is joined by good conjunction; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, unless an abscess occurs in the limb. But if an abscess occurs there, then you leave it for a few days until the abscess has matured and subsided, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be made as follows:  You must wrap a firm bandage around the fracture, and fold it two or three times, removing the excess; and then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the hip joint.
And insert a long piece of felt between the thigh and the leg near the knee in the lower parts, and let the ends of the felt come from the upper part of both sides, and then wrap around the leg and thigh what is superfluous of the bandage.
And then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is firm.
And then begin with a firm bandage in the middle over the fracture site with three or four wraps, and the further you move away from the fracture site, the looser, lighter, and softer your bandage should be.
And then extend the two ends of the felt to the lower parts until it reaches the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage is not loosened from its place.
And then leave the bandage on, provided that it does not cause corrosion, a hot abscess, swelling, or anything similar to those; and if any of these things occur, then carefully loosen it, and correct whatever has happened, according to what we have already said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone in the bone that protrudes, then you must reduce it as best as you can; and if not, dress it and leave it, and treat it with what has been previously mentioned until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is tightened in addition to splints being applied, as we have said in the case of the help (treatment) for the arm.
However, in the restoration done in this way, lameness does not occur to the patient; and if it is restored alone, other than having the other leg applied to it, then it is necessary that he limps on the affected side.
And know that the thigh is bound for 40 days or a little more or a little less, and all this is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions (of the patient).
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap heals slowly, but often causes considerable attrition (or wearing down/damage).
But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with a wound or without a wound, and everything about it has been observed with feeling (i.e., through examination).
And its restoration is such that what is broken of its parts should be joined together with said things until it is added and joined as much as possible by equalization, ease, and fabrication (or skillful construction).
Then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you need one; and bind it above with a suitable bandage.
And then consider all the provisions that we have recounted in the other fractures, such as a hot poultice and similar things, so that every accident is opposed with what is suitable for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the restoration of a leg fracture.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is large, and is called by the name of tibia [shinbone]; and the other is thin, and is called fibula.
And the same kinds of fractures happen to these two bones of the leg as happen to the two bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is one and the same.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is deformed in all parts.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is deformed in the front parts.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find that below, and it is one of those things that are not readily apparent to you.
Then administer extension, setting, and ligation of the splints according to that same manner.
However, if the leg fracture is extensive, having many fragments, the extension should be gentler and lighter, and alleviate it with your skill.
And in the leg, there is some similarity of operation to the arm; and when you align the splints and complete your operation, then you will take pieces of pine wood which are placed under the bandages which are placed on the sores, and they are made especially of palm branches; choose those that are of small thickness and not slender ones; and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the very bottom.
Then wrap around each [splint] a cloth in two layers according to its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side, and let them be from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then bind the two splints in three places: at the two extremities and in the middle; for with this structure, the leg is prevented from bending to the right and left, and remains in a good position.
And now a small wooden splint, according to the length of the leg, has been provided; and let the leg be placed upon it so that it retains that [leg's] movement.  (The "that" refers to the proper alignment/position, not necessarily free movement).
And especially you should do this in a fracture, and when there is a wound specifically with it.
Then examine the leg each day and study it carefully, and watch it for abscesses and inflammation or other similar things; and if any of these things occur, then attend to it with what is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the talus and of the bones of the foot and of the toes.
A fracture of the whole talus does not often occur; but fractures of the bones of the foot occur sometimes; and fractures of the toes rarely occur, and they do not suffer from anything but attrition in cases of improper positioning.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and sometimes those bones are raised up amongst themselves, then the patient should place his foot on the ground prepared as before.
Then place one foot on what is elevated of those bones, and then press down and pull them until they return to their places.
Then apply a plaster and lint on top, and place under the sole of the foot a small board to which two flat pieces are attached.
Then bind that tightly to the foot with a descending bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things which are needed.
And when three or four days have passed for him, then untie the bandage, for you will find the bones united, or whether they are fractured or dislocated, and the operation in those cases is as you know.
But if some say they are fractured, then restore them and set them as I have recounted to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place on the fractured finger a splint according to the length of the finger, and let it be a little longer than it; and place under the foot that board which I have mentioned to you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
But if what is fractured of the bones is two or three or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its size wrapped in linen cloth, and bind the board to the lowest part of the foot, and let it stand on one of the ends of the board beyond the instep of the foot so that it holds it with good retention.
And it is convenient for you that you do not forget to consider all the things that I have said to you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose yourself to every accident with what is appropriate.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the fracture of the woman's hip and of the pubic bone, and of the man's penis.
When the hip of the woman is fractured, then make her lie down on her side, and gently incline her towards the back a little, and let her be held there.
And then the midwife fills the hip with cotton, and it should be made into a ball in her hip; and then the woman should be held, and her back raised little by little, for all this is pushed until the fractured part of the hip is in place like a sphere, and the broken bone returns to its position.
And then place powders on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and let her urinate, and reposition and return it according to the manner in which you arranged it at the beginning, and then return to the first powdering.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it will be healed.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and attach a reed tube to its opening; and introduce the whole bladder into her hip, and then inflate it through the tube until the bladder is inflated inside the hip, for this will help the fracture to reset.
And then it should be filled with cotton and remain thus for some days as we have recounted, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the pubis of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and healing that which we have recounted for the hip bone.
And that which is right is not hidden in these proximate fractures which seldom occur, especially to him who has some study and use of and understands this my book well; for this fracture signifies to you in the greatest dispositions the rightful way in its restoration and in its binding, and therefore understand well.
But in the penis of a man, when it is broken, take goose grease, and put the penis in that; and then place a cloth bandage over it, and let it be wrapped, and then let it be left for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
It is convenient for one who suffers a fracture with a wound, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar to that, that you carefully and immediately phlebotomize him if the conditions for phlebotomy testify to you as we have said above.
And if the wound flows blood, then it is necessary that you attend to its retention so that you pulverize crushed egg whites over it, if no other cause is present to you.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not prolong this, lest an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you should leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, then it is necessary that you carefully reduce it and align it with your hands easily and with little extension.
But if extension is not prepared for you and the alignment of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, its length is seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them, according to the quantity required for this in the treatment of every type of fracture.
And let it be round, and let it be of little thickness so that it is not bent due to the compression on it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp end which has a margin at its ends; and let the top of it be of increasing thickness, and from the middle of it to the ends.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", that is, a small splint.
Therefore it is necessary that the sharp end of it be placed raised above the end of the prominent bone.
And drive that in at once until the bone returns, and is set with some equalization/setting.
And then strive to align the ends of the fracture between them; and if the broken end of the bone is thin and does not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary that you incise the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone entirely with what we have recounted, then incise it with whatever is suitable from the incisors which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient finds vehement, persistent pain, then know that the bone is not returned to its natural place; and then do what you can to give the patient great relief/assistance.
When your restoration of the bone is completed, then submerge a cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption.
And then administer stitches at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you may incise the opening with scissors and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And guard yourself with all caution that you do not constrict the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish physicians have done this, and it has caused death or a corrosive or suppurating illness, that is, gangrene, in their patients. And if your constriction is light, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have recounted, and you find pain in the place, then it is not fitting that you place stitches there, but apply a bandage of hard cloths instead of stitches and bind it with them.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to generate pus, then you remove the cloth which you had placed over it with wine, and then administer poultices, ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is necessary for you to untie the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed, and it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows from it to the lower parts easily.
If many days pass and the wound is not healed, nor is the pus discharged from it, then know that here there are signs of small foreign bodies, wherefore it is necessary to probe the wound with a probe. And of those foreign bodies, those that are separated, remove and extract them; those which are not separated and which hinder the limb and cause pain, force yourself to incise them as much as is possible for you.
And if there occurs in the wound swelling or ulceration, that is, erysipelas, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary that you treat each of these with that which is appropriate to it, from the treatment of which a description has preceded in its chapter.
And this is what my discourse should focus on, and you should take note: when a large bone is fractured, elevate the limb, as with the bone of the thigh and the humerus and similar large bones, and do not attempt traction or extraction of it, for many times death results from this; rather leave it until it suppurates, for it will fall off by itself very quickly, in about twenty or thirty days; and then, if you deem it necessary, treat the wound, and if not, leave it.
Chapter 20.
Chapter 20. On the treatment of callus that occurs in the place of a fracture.
Often this callus occurs at the site of healing of a fracture, especially if it is near the joints, and it deforms the shape of the limb; and it quickly prevents the limb from its natural function.
Therefore, consider if the callus is recent and apply medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, incense, myrrh, cerecloth, and acacia, and similar substances; so that you take some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with sour wine, and apply it to the callus on a piece of lint, and bind it tightly.
And leave the bandage tightly bound for many days; then unbind it and reapply another, until the callus is softened; or apply a thin lead plate on it, because lead has the property of resolving anything swollen in the limbs.
But if the callus has already turned to bone and is tight, and necessity compels its removal carefully, then incise it at its highest point, and excise the excess and prominent part, or rasp it with a file until it is softened; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture, when it is restored but the limb remains thin and weak, not according to its natural state.
When a bone fracture is healed, and yet the limb remains thin and weak, this is caused by many things: one of which is excessive loosening of the ligament and its binding not as it should be; or by excessive tightness of the bandages, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or by excessive or superfluous application of poultices; or by excessive movement not at the proper time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and resulting weakness.
And the cure for this is to give the patient nourishing food and to comfort their heart so that their blood is increased; and administer baths; and instill joy and happiness in them.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continuously apply warm water poultices until the nourishment flows and the limb returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Chapter 22. Of the treatment of fractured bones when they are healed crookedly, and preventing this from happening.
When a previously healed limb suffers from crookedness and prominence at the site of the fractured bone and swelling, and this causes deformity of the limb, but the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not heed the words of one who claims that the limb is newly fractured.
But many foolish physicians and healers have done this in our land; and this practice is most reprehensible, leading to great fear, the sign of which is mortal.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed in lukewarm water in which softening herbs are boiled, such as mallow leaves and roots, melilot, and similar herbs; and a softening plaster should be applied, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of mallow root should be prepared and mixed with white of egg or olive oil, and applied as a plaster; or ripe figs should be crushed with pigeon droppings, and similar softening and consolidating remedies.
And sometimes it is resolved with gentle, frequent rubbing with moistened hands, and the limb should be moved in every direction at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become severe and hardened, and surgical treatment is required, then the excess should be carefully removed, and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and the superfluous swelling around the bone should be incised with fine scalpels, and this should be facilitated with care and diligence.
Chapter 23.
Concerning a discourse on dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of one of the joints from its place, whereby movement is prevented, the shape of the limb is distorted, and it causes great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs to someone, it is necessary to strive immediately for its reduction, and not delay that reduction, for if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and thus the reduction of the dislocation becomes very difficult.
And for this reason, it should not be moved or stretched at the time of inflammation, for many times it causes spasms and intense pain.
But when this happens, then you should attend to the phlebotomy of the patient, and let him rest until the inflammation subsides; and then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated in such a way that its proper function will return.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation according to the order followed in fractures; from the most superior part of the body to the most inferior part.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated, it is not delayed; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are dislodged from their places by slight movement, and are somewhat softened; or they are dislocated by complete and total dislocation, until they are softened at the joint, to the point that saliva flows from the patient and they cannot retain it, nor close their mouth, and their tongue is entangled in their speech.
But when their dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, then a reduction must be administered promptly, and not delayed at all.
And it is so that the assistant holds the patient's head, and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the root of the jaw's dislocation inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he inserts both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands are outside with which he pulls; and he commands the patient to relax their jaws and allow them to be moved from each side; and the physician pulls the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer a vaporization with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easier, and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And so when they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place on it powders of cloth with cerot (a type of plaster), and it should be made of wax and rose oil; and then it should be bound easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their side, and their head should be resting between two pillows, so that it does not hurt to the right or left side; and do not force them to chew anything; rather, their food should be broth, until when the pains are lessened and the jaws are healed, then let them eat what they want.
And this should be administered with ease, and do not work on opening the mouth during eating, drinking, and speaking, until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and are not returned to their places, then many times fevers and persistent thirst occur, and very quickly the patient's belly is distended, and very quickly and violently they vomit pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is perilous; and many times he for whom this happens dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and of the extremity of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated inwards from its connection with the breastbone; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is apparent to the touch.
And the restoration of it is that the patient lie on his back and extend his arms. And then constrict the area with your palm with firm constriction, for it will return.
And then place a plaster and powders on that and bind it tightly.
But the extremity of that which is the hip and is continuous with it, is not dislocated in any way; then it must be reduced and bandaged as we have said and as is appropriate for you.
And then place a plaster, and powders, and a bandage on that, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that a muscle is dislocated in only three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated to the upper part of the muscle, and this is done late; and it is not dislocated to the parts behind by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the parts in front by the nerves.
And mostly it is dislocated and protrudes to the lower parts below the shoulder, and especially in those whose flesh is scant, it is easily dislocated; but in those in whom there is much flesh, it protrudes with difficulty.
And it quickly happens to some men by a blow or fall, and their muscle is inflamed by a hot abscess, and it is believed because of this that it is dislocated.
Then it is necessary that you prove this before you are completely certain of it, and then you proceed to its cure.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts below the shoulder; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, because you find a manifest difference between them; and you find in the head of the muscle a concavity, and below the shoulder near the touching of the head of the muscle, like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all movements.
If it is dislocated below the feet or above, and you then find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easily done when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises the patient's hand to the upper parts; and then places his hands below the patient's shoulder, and raises the joint forcefully up to its place, and the minister raises the patient's hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it below because it returns easily.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and from the beginning that the dislocation happened, many days have passed, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water and that a poultice be applied which softens and lubricates, such as boiled roots of althea, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be applied.
And then the patient should be supine on his back and a wool ball be placed under his shoulder, of a consistency between soft and firm, and then the doctor places his heel on the ball, and raises the head of the muscle with force, and pulls the patient's arm so that it is not pulled downwards, and another minister holds the patient's head so that it is not pulled downwards, because it then immediately returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method:  that you have present a man who is taller than the patient, and he stands on that side, and inserts his shoulder under the patient's shoulder and raises the patient's shoulder to the upper parts until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the patient's arm from the lower parts of his belly. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, in order to weigh him down, because the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reduced easily in another way: that a long pole be fixed in the ground, the top of which is round in shape, like a pestle, neither thick nor thin, and then it is placed under the patient; after having placed linen cloths on top of the pole, and the patient is standing along the length of the pole, and then his arm is extended downwards on the other side; and his body is extended on the other side with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if its reduction is difficult for all the reasons we have mentioned, then use this treatment: that you take a pole the length of which is two braccia, and the width of which is four fingers, and its thickness should be lessened at the top near the shoulder according to this form:
And then on the round top, linen cloths should be tied so that the pole does not hurt the patient.
And then it is placed under the armpit of the patient, and the hand or arm is extended over the pole down to the lower parts, and the pole is tied around the armpit and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a rung of a ladder according to its width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the other side of the body is suspended on the other side, for the joint enters immediately.
And when its entry is completed in whatever way is possible for you, then you must place under the armpit a ball of wool of suitable size; and then apply a plaster prepared from powdered  millet and egg white over the whole muscle, so that it is wrapped around it, and then tighten under the armpit with a decent bandage; and the bandage should be wrapped over the plaster, and his hand should be attached to his neck, and it should be left, and his hand should not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's diet be light until the limb is strengthened, for this is more conducive to his healing.
And then the diet should be increased after seven or five days and some movement should be exercised; and then if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity affecting it or some other cause, then cautery with three holes should be administered there, as previously described in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is untied and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and the bandage are reapplied several times, and it is not firm and hangs loose and cannot raise that arm to the upper parts, then know that its nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are severed or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Regarding the dislocation which occurs between the foot and the ankle or the posterior parts, the reduction is done with impulse and extension with the hands, until it returns [to its place].
And another bandage should be applied to it, and treat it until it is healed.
And if during the healing process there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths many times until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its former natural state.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated elbow.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and more so to the front than to the back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is apparent to the sight or to the touch, depending on how it is dislocated. And when you compare the dislocated elbow to the sound one, this is clearly shown to you, because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch its muscle with it.
And it is necessary that you act quickly and reduce the dislocation before a hot abscess develops, for if a hot abscess develops, its reduction is difficult, and it is not easily healed completely; and especially when it is in the posterior parts, for it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and causes greater pain, and often leads to death with it.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's hand should be extended with two hands, and their arm expanded, and the doctor's hands should be on and under the elbow, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front, then return it in such a way that you bend the hand with your hand, until you strike the elbow with the root of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer strong and very forceful extension.
And it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two other assistants hold it firmly so that it is not moved during the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, after it is wrapped in a long folded cloth over the patient's hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that this helps lubricate the joint easily; and then push the joint with strong pressure until it returns to its place.
And after the reduction, he should be placed on a plaster which has styptic and drying properties with egg white, and it should be bound tightly with a descending bandage, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left like that for some days.
And then it should be unbound; and if the joint is formed in its place, then unbind the bandage and leave it.
And if you see the joint is not well tightened, then repeat the plaster and bandage, and leave it for some days until it is tightened; and then unbind it.
But if the patient experiences pain after the reduction of the joint, and their disposition is agitated, then administer moist heat in a bath and gentle friction, and compression, until relief is obtained; or place on the joint an emollient, that is, something very oily; and then it should be bandaged, and left on the bone day and night. And then remove that, and put him in a bath; and when he is sweating, then rub the joint with a temperate friction, and then again apply the emollient, that is, something very oily, once, and a second time, and a third time. with the use of a bath, until it is softened.
And if you wish, place on it warm, moist cow dung and bind it tightly; and do this several times, because it is moist and brings it back to its proper state.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocation of the wrist, that is, of the joint that is between the arm and the hand.
The wrist is sometimes dislocated, and its reduction is easy, unlike other joints; however, speed is necessary in its reduction at the time it is dislocated, before the place becomes inflamed or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's wrist joint on a table and the assistant extends the patient's hand, and the physician places his hand or his palm on the prominence of the joint, and pulls it until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered whether the palm is already turned towards the belly of the hand; then the patient should place the back of his hand on a table during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then the position of the patient's hand should be on the table with the palm down, so that the physician's hand can fall on the prominence of the joint.
And so if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then compress it with a poultice to soften the inflammation and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, you will not be able to achieve reduction once several days have passed.
However, if the joint remains twisted and causes no harm to the patient except that the hand is weakened and cannot grasp anything, then you should know that the nerves are pinched or bruised, and then there is no remedy except to cauterize near the injury and very quickly apply a bandage.
Therefore, when the limb is set, then apply the poultice we have recommended, and let it be applied and bandaged for five days; then it should be unbound and left, and the patient's hand should be exercised.
But if its movement is impeded and some gravity occurs, then soothe it with warm water and massage several times until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in their entirety.
And when a finger is dislocated towards the back of the palm or the belly of the hand, then straighten the finger and force its dislocation back with your hands until it returns to place.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it downwards from the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened and aligned on that same day.
And when night comes, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is tight (or healed/firm).
And do likewise if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform your first operation in this way until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter 30.
Of the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation happens to any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are removed from their places, then in that case there is no cure, for death is expected for the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excrement is expelled involuntarily, and he cannot retain it; and often some of his limbs are paralyzed,  either both legs or both arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is dislocated, for often it is dislocated, and sometimes the dislocation affects the four limbs.
Therefore, that is dislocated in the back parts and is called paralysis.
But the treatment is that then you consider if the paralysis comes from an infection (or fever), because then in that case there is no cure nor healing at all.
But in that which comes from a fall or from a blow or something similar, the Ancients already described the methods of cure with lengthy discourses, of which the most returns with profit; but I will now abbreviate that, whose brevity excuses its length, for my proximity to my intended exposition, with which I have expounded and formulated this, and formed it from diverse instruments, with which I will show this and explain that.
And of those, only that which affects the two (legs) properly is cured with what I have recounted.
And it is so that the patient is laid on their face on a soft cushion close to a wall, and a soft mat is placed under them so that their feet are not irritated.
And then a straight pole is placed, fixed in the ground at the head end of the bed near the patient's head, and another pole at the foot end of the bed, near the patient's feet.
And the assistant holds the pole, and it should not be fixed in a pit; and another assistant holds the other pole in the same manner.
Then wrap a strong linen bandage around the patient's head and under their chin; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole which is by their head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage around their hips, their buttocks, and their legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other pole which is by their feet.
Then each assistant stretches the bandages to their respective poles, and the two poles and the bandages are not removed from their positions, but however, they are not fixed as we have said.
And the physician places his palms on the spine with firmness until it returns to its place, or places a board there, and then adjusts his feet on the board until it returns to place.
But if it does not return to place by this method, then take a board whose width or length is about three braccia, and make a hole in the wall which we have said is near the patient, where the end of the board will fit. Then place half of the board on the spine, and the physician places his feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you wish, open with a drill which is turned by hand; and you should place in the ground, beneath the patient's head at the back of the neck, two poles, the length of which is one braccio, and beneath the patient's head at the back of the neck, two poles; and let the distance between each pole be one palm, and let a hole be made in each pole through which the drill passes, and let each be firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move.
And let there be placed a round pole in which is the drill, and let it be rotated in the two holes of the two poles.
And at its end is a hole in which the pole is fitted, the length of which is one palm including the revolving part; and in the two other poles is something similar to that.
Then tighten the straps that you have tied to the patient's feet at the hole which is under their head, and the straps that you have tied to their thighs at the drill which is under their feet.
And then, by each drill, let a servant stand who twists the drill with their hand, and the physician sets the vertebra as we have said.
Then, once the vertebra is returned and the place is set, you should apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then lint; and then place over the plaster a tablet of wood whose width should be three fingers or thereabouts, and whose length should be sufficient to cover the area of the swelling, and the healthy part of the vertebra.
Then it should be bound with the straps we have mentioned, and feed the patient a light diet until they are healed.
And if any swelling remains in the area at the end of healing, then medicines should be administered that soften and smooth, with the application of the wooden tablet for a long time, which we have recommended; and a lead plate should also be applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the back of the spinal vertebrae, and is caused by that dislocation; and it is that bone which already swells, so that no attempt should be made to treat it with this medicine, for it will very quickly cause death.
Chapter 31.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint suffer only dislocation, and they do not experience what happens to other joints of small movement and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, or outwards, or forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards.
And a sign of its inward dislocation is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg is longer and the knee more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot without pain, and it is the place where the pain becomes an abscess, because the head of the femur has already reached there.
And the sign of that to which dislocation happens outwards, is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And a sign of that to which dislocation happens forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but yet cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he forces himself to walk he cannot do so on the front part; and his urine is retained and his pain becomes an abscess, and he cannot walk on his heel.
And a sign of that to which dislocation happens backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the hip, and his leg is shorter than the other, and the hip is softened, and the head of the femur is behind that place.
But reduction of the types of this dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and chronic, that it is already healed with having it near you, you administer its reduction and it remains according to its disposition, then it is not in that cure of all; and then it is not fitting that presumption be made in that.
But in one in whom the dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four types of dislocation, then take care that you return the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, for it quickly returns and does not need other treatment.
But, if it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part, either with your hands, or with a bandage which is tied above the knee; and another assistant extend the hand of that one from above so that he places his hands under his heels; and then tighten with a strong bandage on the root of the thigh, and let another assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be from him or from the inner part to the hip at the part of the fork (groin), or from the back part to the part of the back.
And let the extension of all of them be at once until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four (types of dislocation).
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type that which we shall say of its proper cure.
In the reduction of the hip itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is on the inner parts, it is necessary that the patient be supine on his sound side; and then place the ligaments on the root of the thigh in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the place which is below the hip; and then extend the ligament up from the part of the hip to the highest part of the groin.
And then another strong attendant should take his arms, and firmly grasp the thick part of the affected thigh and extend it outwards with a strong extension, for by this it returns to its place.
And this type is of easier cure, with which this member is reduced, than the other types.
But if it is displaced upwards and does not yield to treatment with this type of cure at all, then it is necessary that the patient's two feet be bound together with a strong, light ligament, above both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each (ligament) be the quantity of four digits, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two digits.
And then let the patient be suspended from the head by a beam, and let him be indoors; and let his height above the ground be the quantity of two arms' lengths.
And then order a strong young man to reduce the head of the thigh, and let another young man be suspended with the patient, and the other young man, reducing the joint with forceful pressure, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the patient lie on his back as we have recommended in the case of coldness; and let the ligament be tightened around the affected leg properly and around his feet.
And then two beams should be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head; and then let adjusted beams be placed in the middle of the elevation, upon which wet cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the beam is between his thighs, so that during the extension to the lower parts it is not pulled.
And then each assistant extends on his side, and the physician with his hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended lightly, and it is according to this same narration on a support; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the patient's patella, and then grasps that with the other hand, and with that grasp places that extended to the lower parts to the part of the knee.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended to the lower parts, and he is elevated above the ground;  instead it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary for the raising if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about his lying on two cushions; and if it is on his face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, there is little harm.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board on the place where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as it should be — and the sign of his reduction is not hidden from you, and that is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see those equal and the patient bends his leg and extends it without difficulty, then you know that the limb is returned as it should be — and then you adjust the two thighs and apply a plaster and bind it so that the hip is not moved in any of the parts; and let the patient rest for three or four days.
Then untie the ligaments and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then you know that the dislocation is now healed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause for softening, then you return and plaster that, and bind that according to your first binding, and leave it for three days.
Then untie it, and have him delay walking on it for a few days, until it is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, and inwards, and downwards, more towards the back; and it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply his leg to his thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its dislocations is that you make the patient lie down straight, so that he extends his leg if he can; apply your two hands to his face, and place his foot between your feet; and then apply his knee to your palms, and hold those between your fingers on his knee firmly, and another assistant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that his leg adheres to the thigh easily and without effort.
And then plaster that and bind the leg to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for some days, until he is healed and strengthened.
But if its reduction is difficult for you, then administer strong extension with the bandages of which the treatment of the hip has preceded narration. (or: ...with the bandages, the use of which in the treatment of the hip has been previously described).
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the talus (ankle bone).
The talus is sometimes dislocated by a slight movement, and sometimes completely dislocated, and its dislocation is either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the talus swells, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its slight dislocation is by gentle reduction, and that is to be extended easily with the hands and bandaged until it returns (to its place).
But in treating it when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient lie down straight, and have a strong and capable assistant hold him from behind at the back of his back, in the middle of his body.
Then you, with your right hand, take the foot from the upper part, and with your left hand the lower part of the foot at the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand twice, and then extend with the left; and push the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice, as we have described.
Then, push the foot towards the leg a third time, and you will be at the ankle.
Then it will return in one or two attempts according to this method, and if you see the foot set correctly, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation, for it will return.
But if reduction by the method we have described is forbidden to you, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and tightly fasten a small pillow to the ground, which should be placed between their thighs, and you should have wrapped a cloth around it so that it does not hurt the patient.
Then let the patient's attendant hold their thighs, and let another attendant extend the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied around the ankle; then let each attendant extend against the extension of the other, and let the pillow remain between the patient's thighs holding it, so that their body is not pulled downwards against their extension.
Then let the physician set the dislocation with his hands, and let another attendant hold the healthy thigh lower down, because the dislocation easily returns.
And so when the dislocation returns and the successful reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And it is necessary that you fear or beware of the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage over it is not tight and strongly injures them.
Then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is loosened, tighten it.
Then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not be dissolved and corrupted, and therefore will not receive a cure.
And if a hot abscess occurs to him, then it is necessary that you administer in its treatment that which we described previously, in another place of treatment and application, until it is healed.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocations of the toes.
It is necessary that what is dislocated be healed with little extension without work; and this which is not difficult, beforehand is light/easy.
But if the dislocation is in some joint of the toe, then it is necessary that you make the patient place his foot on a level surface of the earth or on a table, and be standing there as if he were walking.
And then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from the joints, and then press that with your foot with force until it returns, and that you see that it is already healed and no prominence appears in the place.
And then place under the sole of his foot a board that covers the whole foot, to which are two ends, and then tighten that with a decent and firm bandage for three days; and then untie it and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and its return is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocations that are made with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When any of these causes occur, and you are diligent in its cure and in his restoration, many times death ensues.
And therefore it is not fitting that anyone should presume upon his cure, except one who is wise in the art, of long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not rash nor presumptuous; and who uses in the beginning only such medicines as lessen hot abscesses, and leaves the patient to divine judgment, except for one in whom you hope for salvation from ruin, with alleviation of the sickness, and in whom some hope appears. And then strive at once to reduce it at the beginning of the cause, before a hot abscess develops.
And then, if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen which lessens hot abscesses and treat the wound with what is suitable for it of drying ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and the jagged ends of the bone are separated, then you must strive to join them, and do in this what we have said in the simple diseases which precede this in those locations.
And guard and avoid, according to your ability, that which enters into the paths of fear as my preaching has preceded you; for this is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and more salutary to your true self in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
