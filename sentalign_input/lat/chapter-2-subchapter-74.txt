On perforation of an ulcer occurring in the uterus.
Chapter 74.
Many types of swellings occur in the uterus, such as cancer, stone-like swellings, ulcers, adubelati, alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, thelil, and hot swellings.
And indeed, I have already discussed all these afflictions, their types, their signs, and their treatments in the division; but it is necessary in this treatise to speak of the hot swelling that occurs in the uterus, when it is one of the swellings that collects pus, and you want to know how its opening is made with a surgical instrument.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to observe.
Then, if the pain of the swelling is sharp at its beginning, with throbbing, heat, and fever, and you see it redden, and if it is sensitive to the touch, then do not rush to perforate it; treat it with what helps bring it to maturation until the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
Then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a seat with two benches, and have her lean back or support herself on her back, bringing her feet toward the lower part of her abdomen; her hips should be spread, her arms placed under her knees, and each tied with a suitable binding for this.
Then the midwife sits on her right side and uses the instrument that opens the orifice of the uterus.
The form of this instrument is shown in the following illustrations.
And when you wish to use this instrument, you must affix the end of the probe in the depth of the womanâ€™s uterus, so that what enters from the instrument does not go deeper than the depth of the uterus and harm the patient.
If, however, the instrument is longer than necessary, you must place cushions over the covering of the depth of the uterus, to prevent the instrument from entering fully into the depth of the uterus; and the turning screw, which runs in the instrument, should be on the upper side, so the assistant holds the instrument and turns the screw until the depth of the uterus is opened.
When the ulcer appears, can be touched by hand, and is smooth and soft, it is necessary to cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
When the pus is thus evacuated, you must place in the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil with a certain astringency; place the linen cloth and draw the section into the depth of the uterus.
Then place on the outside over the uterus and pubic area clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then, after two days, treat it with an ointment suited to this purpose, until it heals.
And at times the uterus and the wound are washed, so that it is rinsed with water and honey; then with water in which lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to using the ointment.
If the wound is hidden within the uterus, then you must refrain from treating it with an instrument; rather, treat it with what we have discussed in the division.
