The procedure is as follows: you take a fine needle, and put a soft and fine silk thread in it; then join the ends and tie them subtly, and the length of the threads should be one palm long; then arrange another fine silk thread shortly in the eye (of the needle), and tie the ends of the thread; then have the patient put their head in your lap; and be near the sun so that the work is well-lit, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then insert the needle with the whole eye (of the needle) at the root of the adjacent hair, and make it pierce the eyelid quickly until you pull it over the natural hair; then pull the hair up to the eye (of the needle), and put that hair in the eye, whether there is one or two or three or more; then pull your hand until the hairs come out with the whole eye (of the needle) in the eyelid with the natural hair.
And if the eye (of the needle) is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, then pull the eye downwards with all the thread that you have arranged there, until the eye comes out of the hole above and you see it by the vision of the eye; then pull the eye and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair takes root in its place and the flesh grows over it; and if the hair is short, attach a long hair from the natural hair, and let it be raised with the one where you leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
