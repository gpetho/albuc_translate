The forty-fourth chapter on incising the swelling that appears on the larynx from the outside.
And it is called the elephant of the larynx.
This swelling, which is called "fīlat al-ḥalqūm" ("elephant of the larynx"), is a large swelling, the color of the flesh.
And it is common in women.
It is of two types: either it is natural or it is accidental.
As for the natural, there is no remedy for it.
And as for the accidental, it is of two kinds: one resembles lipoma-like goods, and the other kind resembles the swelling that results from a thickening of the artery, and there is danger in incising it, so it is not appropriate to apply iron to it at all, except what is small of it.
If you probe it and examine it with a probe, and you find it resembling lipoma-like goods, and it is not connected to any of the vessels, then incise it as you incise lipomas and remove it with what contains it of the sac, if it is in a sac, otherwise, completely remove it.
Then treat the area with the appropriate treatment.
