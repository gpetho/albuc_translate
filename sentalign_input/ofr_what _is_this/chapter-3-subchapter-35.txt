of a wound and a dislocation together
When a wound occurs with a dislocation, and one wants to treat it, it often happens that the patient dies: so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, unless you are wise in the art and have practiced it for a long time, and unless you are compassionate and merciful and cautious, not bold; and use at the beginning things that soothe hot swelling, and leave the patient in God's hand if you see no hope of recovery; and when you do see hope, then immediately return the limb to its place, before the hot swelling comes; and when the limb is in place, then administer things that soothe hot swelling, and treat the wound, as is appropriate, with drying ointments; and if there is a fracture with the dislocation, and small bones separated, then remove them, and do what we have said for simple ailments; and beware of acting out of fear, as I have said, for this is worth much to you according to your Creator, and for the safety of your soul and your body. 
Amen
