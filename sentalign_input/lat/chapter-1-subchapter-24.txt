On the method of cauterizing for lung ailments and cough.
Chapter 26.
When cough and lung disease arise from cold humors, and the patient has neither fever nor consumption, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork of the collarbone, in soft, shallow, and empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; let the cautery be tubular, following the previous form.
And if you wish your cauterization to be punctuated with a cautery called “the Point,” which was previously described in the cauterization of ear pain; let there be up to thirty points, almost reaching each other.
Then treat him with what was used before, until he is healed.
And now let the cautery have three branches, in this shape.
Thus the cauterization is alleviated when you make with it three cauteries at once.
