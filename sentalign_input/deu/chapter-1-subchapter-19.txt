Chapter Nineteen:
On the Cauterization of a Fistula in the Mouth.
When an abscess forms in the root of the uvula, palate, or tooth roots, and it breaks and becomes chronic, forming a fistula, and your treatment is ineffective, it is necessary to use a cautery. Heat the cautery to fit the fistula and insert it into the fistula, holding it until the hot iron reaches the base; repeat this once or twice if needed, and then treat it as previously described until it heals.
If the pus is removed and it heals, that is good; if not, it is necessary to expose the area and remove the decayed bone as described in the relevant chapter.
