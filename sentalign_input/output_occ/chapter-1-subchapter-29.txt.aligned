The ancients said that the cautery made from the roots of aristologia for cold pleurisy is done in this way: take a long dry root of aristologia that is found and is the thickness of a finger.	The Ancients mentioned a cauterization for cold pleurisy by means of the roots of the long birthwort, in this fashion: you take the longest you can find of the roots of the long dry birthwort, and of the thickness of one finger; dip this in oil and light it at the fire; then burn the patient with one cauterization in the space between the junction of the neck with the clavicle; and two small cauterizations below the jugular veins, inclining slightly toward the region below the beard.	0.63116515
Then submerge it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with one cautery in the place between the continuation of the furcula (collarbone) and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the clavicles, slightly inclined to the area below the chin, and with two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined to the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and another on the stomach, and three cauteries on the back; and one cautery in the place between the two shoulders, and two cauteries on both sides of the chest, below the cautery between the two shoulders.	And two big cauterizations above the nipples in the space between the third and fourth ribs; and two more between the fifth and sixth ribs, tending slightly toward the back; and another in the middle of the chest; and another above the stomach; and three more behind, namely, one between the scapulae and two on either side of the dorsal spine below the one between the scapulae.	0.7507722
And it is not necessary to press too much with the cautery, but it should be evident in the tendon during the procedure.	It is not necessary to cauterize deeply, but let it be a mere hint, in the outer skin.	0.4921816
Some ancients also said that some people use a cautery of iron similar to a rod and heat it, placing it in the location between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess and pus is expelled, as we have said for the liver abscess.	Now one of the Ancients mentioned that there were some people who used an iron cautery shaped like a probe, and introduced it red hot into the intercostal space until it reached the abscess itself and evacuated the pus, as we have mentioned under tumour of the liver.	0.84226215
But in this perforation with cautery, there is no fear, because one can die immediately or it can cause a fistula that cannot be healed.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is a danger either that the patient may die on the spot or that an incurable fistula may arise at the place.	0.7891817
