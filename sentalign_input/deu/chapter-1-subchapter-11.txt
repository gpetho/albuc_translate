Chapter Eleven:
On the Cauterization of Melancholia.
When the causes of melancholia are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, cauterize the patient with the same cauteries mentioned for paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess of black bile and the patient's body is moist, give them something to cleanse their brain as previously mentioned in the division.
Then shave the patient's head and apply a suitably made turban soaked in old sheep’s butter.
The patient should sit upright and be held from all sides.
Then apply liniment; old sheep’s butter is preferable.
Heat it over the fire to a moderate temperature that the patient can tolerate.
Pour this onto the middle of the head within the turban and let it cool.
Do this once a week with other suitable regimens until cured. Or, if preferred, cauterize the patient with small points in the same manner, ensuring you hold the cautery appropriately. This type of cautery moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply cotton soaked in butter or chicken fat.
