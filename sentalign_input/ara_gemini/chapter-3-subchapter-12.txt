The twelfth chapter on the reduction of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones called the two ulnas, one of which is small, and it is the one next to the thumb, and the other is large, and it is located below the small one from the bottom; so perhaps the larger ulna may be broken alone or the small one alone, and perhaps both may be broken together.
So when the small upper ulna is broken, its repair is easy and its healing is faster, and when the lower ulna is broken, its breakage is bad and its healing is difficult, and the worst of it is if the two bones break together.
So, if the bone that is broken is the small upper ulna, then the physician should, when repairing it, make its extension slight gently until he straightens it; and if the large ulna is the one that is broken, then he should make its extension stronger; and if both ulnas are the ones that are broken, then he should make the extension much stronger.
And it is necessary to place the shape of the hand when repairing it and extending it stretched out on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be upwards, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the rest of the fingers, and the patient sitting cross-legged, and let the cushion be opposite him in height so that the patient is not burdened with hardship; then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends from above likewise; then the physician straightens the bone until he restores it to the best shape he can.
And if there are splinters in the bone fracture, then you try to return each splinter to its place with your best effort. If a loose splinter appears in it and it is piercing the skin, and you have no hope of repairing it, then incise upon it and extract it in the manner we mentioned previously.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then I have devoted a chapter to it, so you take the treatment for that from there.
And if a hot swelling occurs at the beginning of your repair, then smear a cloth with the cerate made with rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thick and thin, and tie the cloth on it with a gentle tie until the swelling subsides, then remove the cerate and apply the poultice prepared from mill dust with egg white, then apply the splints, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be slightly wider and stronger.
And know that the number of arm splints is six in most cases, whether the fracture is in one ulna or in both ulnas together.
Then make your tightening on the site of the fracture stronger and tighter, and whenever you turn the tightening upwards or downwards, make the tightening slightly looser, as mentioned previously at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped on the fracture be soft and moist cloths, and let them not be very hard, and let the thread that is tied with it be specifically linen, medium between thin and thick, as we described.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days, and if something happens that needs to be corrected, such as an itch occurring in the limb, then it is necessary to wash the limb with warm water until the itch subsides, and leave the limb untied for a night until it rests, then resume tightening.
And if the tightening has loosened and the bone has shifted or something like that, then repair all of that with your best effort.
And look also, and if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, then you should loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until the nourishment flows to it, then tighten it.
And if nothing of what we mentioned happens to the patient, then it should not be loosened until after twenty days or so.
Then hang the patient's hand from his neck, and let his arm be straight, and let him diligently avoid turbulent movements, and let his sleep be on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days, all of that according to the states of the temperaments and the states of strength.
