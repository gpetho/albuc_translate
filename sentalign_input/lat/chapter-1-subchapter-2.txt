On the method of cauterizing the head in cases of pain throughout the entire head.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head and persists in the patient, and he uses syrups, oils, head purgatives, and ointments.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with the cautery we have described, and none of these treatments help him, then consider the following.
For if the head of the patient is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly below that spot.
Then cauterize on each side of his head with a cautery, until it passes through the skin and exposes the amount of bone we have mentioned.
And cauterize him with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place called "vas," where the cup is applied; lift your hand in this, and do not expose the bone.
For the patient will feel intense pain from this, unlike the pain from the other head cauteries.
And I will describe this cautery in its place: and it is necessary that it is a cautery used for cauterizing the sides and back of the head, more finely than the cautery used on the center of the head.
And this is its form.
