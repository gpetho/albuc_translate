Chapter Eighty-Two
On the Treatment of Ingrown and Non-Ingrown Nails, Dry Warts, and Calluses.
A corn is a round nodule, the color of flesh, resembling the head of a nail. It occurs all over the body, especially on the soles of the feet and toes, and causes pain when walking.
It should be incised around the nail, grasped with forceps or a hook, and extracted from its root. Then treat it. If you wish, cauterize it as described previously in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, compact, round protuberance on the surface of the body.
It often occurs on the hands of children. Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it off, or to pierce it with silk thread or a hair until it falls off. If you wish, cauterize it as described previously with fire or a caustic medication.
Ingrown and non-ingrown nails can be removed with the instrument I will describe in the treatment of calluses. As for a callus, it is also a small, compact, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, going very deep.  When cold affects it, one feels a sensation similar to the sting of ants.
It occurs all over the body, but mostly on the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube made of a goose feather or a strong eagle feather and place that tube over the callus so that the circumference of the tube surrounds it on all sides. Then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the callus.
Insert it deep into the flesh and extract the callus from its root. If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:.
The top of the tube should be thin, solid, and twisted to make it easy for the fingers to grasp and twist. If you wish, you may cauterize the callus as described previously for cauterizing warts, in the chapter on cautery.
